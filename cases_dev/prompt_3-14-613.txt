Xcode 12.3 SwiftUI Preview 1 of "Content View Previews" not found in any targets

I see others post with issues using SwiftUI Previews in Xcode 11 and 12, but have not seen this issue elsewhere.
Older project that worked in Xcode 11, loaded in Xcode 12, fails to launch the preview, no matter how simple the Preview content.
Actual preview code:
```
swift
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        Text("I heart Xcode")
            .previewDevice("iPhone 11")
    }
}
```

After clicking "Resume" or "Try Again":
> CouldNotFindInputNodeInBuiltGraphError<XcodeGraphSource,
PreviewInstance>: Preview 1 of "Content View Previews" not found in
any targetsPreview 1 of "Content View Previews" must belong to at least one
target in the current scheme in order to use previewsElement: PreviewInstance(destinationDescription:
UVPreviewPipeline.AnyPreviewDestinationDescription(storage:
UVPreviewPipeline.(unknown context at
$1382211e0).AnyPreviewDestinationDescriptionBoxImpl<UVIntegration.SimulatorPreviewDestinationDescription>),
previewIdentity: UVPreviewPipeline.PreviewIdentity(identifier:
ContentView_Previews[0], description: contentType: Element
contextType: application device: iPhone 11 index: 0 layout: device
supportsLive: true supportsOnDevice: true), variant: nil,
variantedIdentifier: ContentView_Previews[0], identifier:
AnyHashable(ContentView_Previews[0]))
I only have one target, same as before, with no special configuration. I have tried reloading Xcode as well as copying all sources files to a new directory (saw that one somewhere).
Anyone else able to parse this error message or make a recommendation for how to fix SwiftUI previews?
Thanks.
