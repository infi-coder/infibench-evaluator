Need to grep a specific string using curl

I am trying to get language code from pages by curl
I wrote below and work...
```
curl -Ls yahoo.com | grep "lang=" | head -1 | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | cut -d"\"" -f 2
```

but sometimes code is different like
```
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep "lang=" | head -1 | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | cut -d"\"" -f 2
```

they wrote like
```
<html dir="rtl" lang="he-IL">
```

I just need to get `he-IL`
If is there any other way, I would appreciate it...
