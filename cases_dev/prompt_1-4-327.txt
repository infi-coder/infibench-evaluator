data.frame with 2 columns with the same name: how to select the second one?

```r
d1 <- data.frame(a=c(1,2,3))
d2 <- data.frame(a=c(3,4,5))
d3 <- cbind(d1,d2)
```

doesn't return an error, and an inspection of the environment in RStudio displays two columns with the same name.

If I type:

```r
d3$a
```

The first column is selected. How to select the second by name?

Suppose you have get the above variable, please just write codes in R to select the second by name of my frame, and assign the value to a variable named `second_col`.
