I'm trying something very simple: building two themes for a website using Material-UI themes: a light theme and dark one, but it does not work well --- the theme is on every Material-UI react element, but the root element on the html document keeps having the same default white background. Of course it can be changed by attacking the body with pure .css. But I was looking to change it dynamically with React. What Material-UI component should I use?
