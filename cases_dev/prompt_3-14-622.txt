How can I conform to ShapeStyle protocol in SwiftUI?

I am looking to conform to ShapeStyle, the goal is just conforming to ShapeStyle(Nothing more and nothing less).
Here is my code and the issue:
```
swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedView())
    }
}

struct RedView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Color.red
    }
}
```

So I know I could use `Color.red` directly instead of a view, but as I said, the goal of this question is conformation to ShapeStyle. For those going to share apple developer link about ShapeStyle, I have to say I was there before.
Error:
> Instance method 'fill(_:style:)' requires that 'RedView' conform to 'ShapeStyle'
