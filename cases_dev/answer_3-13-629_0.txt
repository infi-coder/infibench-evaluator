Public Sub WriteToClipboard(ByVal text As String)
    CreateObject("htmlfile").ParentWindow.ClipboardData.SetData "text", text
End Sub
Example usage:

WriteToClipboard "test"
Edit #1

The above seems to work in Excel just fine. I only managed to make it work in Access for a specific computer. Once tested on another computer I got an error 70 (access denied).

The below only works in Excel if Windows Explorer is closed. However, it seems to work fine in Access regardless if Explorer is open/closed:

Public Sub WriteToClipboard(ByVal text As String)
    With CreateObject("new:{1C3B4210-F441-11CE-B9EA-00AA006B1A69}") 'MsForms.DataObject
        .SetText text
        .PutInClipboard
    End With
End Sub
