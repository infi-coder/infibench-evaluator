I run the php artisan make:auth command and I will explain step by step what I do after that to understand the scenario,

Login to a new session (example.com/home)
opened a new tab and pasted the URL, ie example.com/home.
Now 2 tabs are open with the same session.
I clicked logout from one of the tabs and it works perfectly fine
Then when I tried to logout from the other tab, it gave me an error saying "419 Page Expired" and it is going nowhere even after reloading.
The thing is, these kinds of scenarios may arise, and I don't want to see this error message, just logout after clicking logout, even if the session is expired.

Note: This issue is not because of not adding @csrf
