grep command in an if statement

```
bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi '$searchT') ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep '$searchT' && wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep '$searchT')

else echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

How do I make the script run if the `if statement` is true. when i run the script the script will output the `else` statement. because there is no value to compare with the grep command.
