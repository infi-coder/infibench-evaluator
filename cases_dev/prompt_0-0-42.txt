I would like to upgrade from `connect-mongo` v3 to v4 in my node JS application.

My old code is 

```javascript
const MongoStore = require('connect-mongo')(session)

...

app.use(session({
    secret: 'story book',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: new MongoStore({ mongooseConnection: mongoose.connection })
}))
```

The mongoURL is stored in `process.env.MONGODB_URI`. Could you help me to revise the above code? You don't need to output explanation or contextual code.
