How do I create multiple constructors for a record type in C#?
I created a record type like this:
```c#
public record Person(int Id, string FirstName, string LastName)
```
Now I want to introduce another constructor overload with no parameters, how can I do that?

Specifically, pelase don't add other text and repeat the following paragraph with [blank] filled:

You can write the following code to introduce another constructor overload with no parameters:
```c#
public record Person(int Id, string FirstName, string LastName){
[blank]
}
```
Please don't add other text and only give me the code to replace [blank].
