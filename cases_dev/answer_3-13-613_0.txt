My scenario and resolution is different for the accepted answer.

I encountered this error today when I moved all my views into a 'Views' group folder. Then my latest view would not generate a preview and xcode displayed the error reported.

Preview provider "Your View" must belong to at least one target in the current scheme in order to use previews

This error was pointing to an existing view I wasn't currently working on, but it was an opened tab.

I closed all the tabs with views that I had open prior to file restructuring. I then reopen the view I was working on and xcode began redisplaying previews.
