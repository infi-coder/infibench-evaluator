Disclaimer: below is only for demo, because all used API are private (by convention, not by design), so reaction of Apple if you submit app with such code to AppStore is unpredictable.

Note: as used interfaces are private they can be changed with any new version.

Main part:

  public func _apply(to shape: inout SwiftUI._ShapeStyle_Shape) {
    Color.red._apply(to: &shape)  // << here !!
  }
Which gives on Xcode 13.3 / iOS 15.4
