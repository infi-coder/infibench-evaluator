Restart terminal without closing on MacOS

How to restart my current MacOS terminal session without closing the window?
In Linux I use `exec bash` but it does not work in this environment. I made a few changes to the `.bash_profile` (prompt, alias etc) I would like to see without closing it and opening again.
