I have a list "rest" which is the following:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
```

I have another list which is b:

```python
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
```

And I have a "last" list:

```python
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

I have to replace the first 4 elements in b with the elements in rest. How can I replace the elements in last according to the matches with b to get the rest elements?

for example:

```python
    5   7   11   4   #elements from rest
b= [21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
```

to get last list as the following:

```python
last=[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]  #elements that matched with b were replaced by rest
```

How can I do this?

Please write a function `ReplaceElementsByIndex` in Python, which takes three lists:rest, b, last as arguments and returns the replaced list,

Function signature is: `ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last)`
