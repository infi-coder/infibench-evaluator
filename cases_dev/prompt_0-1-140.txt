I integrated Font Awesome 5 in a project with bootstrap 4. When I recall a font via CSS it does not work. with Font Awesome 4 the code was as follows:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "FontAwesome";
}
```

How to change the code to make it work with Font Awesome 5?
