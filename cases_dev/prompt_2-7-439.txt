I am told by PHPStorm that I need to composer require ext-zip, however, that command is failing.
The command I am issuing is
```
composer require ext-zip
```
results in
```
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.
```
and
```
Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json to its original content.
```

How to solve this?
