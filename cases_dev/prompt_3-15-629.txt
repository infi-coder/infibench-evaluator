how copy text from vba to windows clipbaord

I have an ms access vba code from which i wish to copy some text value to the Windows clipboard so that I can paste it elsewhere (Word/Excel/Notepad/etc).
I have been searching for this in SO but everything seems over-complicated.
Should it not be something simple like clipboard.SetText textValue?

I tried following the hint by BrianMStafford but don't succeed. Perhaps the reason is that my object is a node in a tree.
When I do MsgBox Me.NodeKey.Value
it all works fine - I see the node path in the message box.
But when I do
Me.NodeKey.SetFocus
DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdCopy
I don't get the node path in the clipboard.
So how can I copy the node path value into the Windows clipboard?
