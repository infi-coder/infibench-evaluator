How to split a comma and colon separated column into respective columns in R?

Say for example I have a dataframe `df`, who has only one column `col1` that looks something like:

```r
name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC
name:Tom,Age:25,City:NA
```

How could I split this column into separate columns such that it would yield a result similar as a data frame to:

```r
   name   | Age | City
1 Michael | 31  | NYC
2  Tom    | 25  | NA
```

Please write a function `mySplit` in R, which takes data frame variable `df` as the argument, which is shown above, and returns tables according to my above requirements.

Function signature is: `mySplit <- function(df)`
