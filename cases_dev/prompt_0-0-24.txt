I have a React app bootstrapped using `create-react-app` and typescript. As the application has grown, I would like to implement absolute imports. I am using VS Code and with very little configuration, I got TS and VS Code to recognize my absolute imports. But, when I ran the app, I got an error: `Error: Cannot find module "component"` I expected to see my app like I did before the absolute imports.

In the newer version of `tsc` or `create-react-app`. Actually, the answer is simple. Please don't add other text and repeat the following paragraph with [blank] filled:

You only need to modify the [blank] property in your [blank] --- If you want the base directory to be your root directory you would set [blank] to `.` or `src` if you want it to be your source directory.
