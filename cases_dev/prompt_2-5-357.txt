I have seen many people using @Autowired annotation in constructor to inject dependencies like as shown below
```java
@Service
public class Employee {

 private EmployeeService employeeService;

 @Autowired
 public Employee(EmployeeService employeeService) {
   this.employeeService = employeeService;
 }
 :
 :
}
```
As per my knowledge nowadays Spring is so advanced and the Spring constructor/setter DI works even without @Autowired like as shown below
```java
@Service
public class Employee {

 private EmployeeService employeeService;

 public Employee(EmployeeService employeeService) {
   this.employeeService = employeeService;
 }
 :
 :
}
```
Like to know is there any reason why people annotate constructor with @Autowired annotation to inject dependencies.

Can someone please help me on this?
