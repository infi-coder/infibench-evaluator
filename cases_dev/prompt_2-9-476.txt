When switching from bash to zsh, I looked up how to resolve an issue with my rbenv folder not being used correctly by zsh and found this:
```
$ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshenv
$ echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshenv
$ echo 'source $HOME/.zshenv' >> ~/.zshrc
$ exec $SHELL
```
I ran all of these and seem to be using the correct rbenv folder now, but I get this error message whenever I open a new iTerm window:
```
/Users/myname/.zshenv:2: command not found: rbenv
```
What am I doing wrong?
Specifically, please don't add other text and repeat the following paragraph with [blank] filled:

You need to add two things to your [blank]. First [blank] itself and second the ruby [blank].
You might also run the `[blank]` to check your installation.
