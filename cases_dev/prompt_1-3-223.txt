How do you check if a package is at its latest version programmatically in a script and return a true or false?

I can check with a script like this:

```python
package='gekko'
import pip
if hasattr(pip, 'main'):
    from pip import main as pipmain
else:
    from pip._internal import main as pipmain
pipmain(['search','gekko'])
```

But how do I check programmatically and return true or false?

Please write a function `checkVersion` in Python, which takes the package name `pkgName` as the argument and returns in boolean.

Function signature is: `checkVersion(pkgName)`
