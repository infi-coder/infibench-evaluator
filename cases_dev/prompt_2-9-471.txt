I am trying to import images to use inside a React component with TypeScript. The bundler I'm using is Parcel (not Webpack).
I have created a `.d.ts` file inside the project with the image file extension, and included it inside `tsconfig.json`. However, when I try to import an image, TS yells at me about `Cannot find module`.
My project structure:
```
+ src
  + assets
    - image.jpg
  + components
    - Box.tsx
    - App.tsx
  - index.d.ts
  - index.html
  - index.tsx
- tsconfig.json
- tslint.json
```typescript
I tried to import the image in App.tsx like this. VS Code underlined '../assets/image.jpg' and said Cannot find module '../assets/image.jpg'.
```
import * as React from 'react';
import * as img from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```
The discussions I found online point to the need of defining a `.d.ts` file myself, so I created that `index.d.ts` file, then added `"include": ["./src/index.d.ts"]` inside `tsconfig.json`.
What did I miss? How can I fix the error TS is throwing?
Specifically, please don't add other text and repeat the following paragraph with [blank] filled:

TypeScript is ignoring `[blank]` because it assumes that it is generated from `index.tsx`, which is more likely to be up to date. Name your `[blank]` file something else, e.g., `declaration.d.ts`.
