I want to use the following code to rename Python Pandas DataFrame columns.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])
avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().rename(columns={1:"mean"})
```

This doesn't work, it tells me `TypeError: rename() got an unexpected keyword argument "columns".` It also doesn't work if I do this,

```python
avg.rename(columns = {1:"mean"}, inplace=True)
```

I cannot figure out why, all documentation tells me that my columns call is correct. I just want to rename the blank column created by my "mean" call to have a string index. All examples I've seen follow this format.

Please write a function `renameDataFrame` in Python, which takes a Pandas DataFrame variable `df` as the argument, which contains the columns as the above example and returns the `df` with the "p" column renamed as "mean" and get the average numbers group by "t" column.

Function signature is: `renameDataFrame(df)`
