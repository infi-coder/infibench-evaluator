What is the idiomatic way to do something when an Option is either None, or the inner value meets some condition?
Is there a more idiomatic way to express something like the following? List as many ways as possible.
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut foo: Option<u8> = None;
    match foo {
        Some(foo_val) if ! (foo_val < 5) /* i.e. the negation of my acceptance condition */ => {}
        _ => { foo.replace(5); }
    }
}
```
