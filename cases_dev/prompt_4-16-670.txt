Openssh Private Key to RSA Private Key

(I am using MAC)
My id_rsa starts with
```
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

but I expect it to starts with
```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

I have send my id_rsa.pub to server administrator to get the access to server, so I don't want to generate a new key.

1. Is there any way that I can transfer my id_rsa which is a openssh private key to a RSA private key? (command please.)
2. If I can transfer, do I also need to transfer id_rsa.pub? (command please.) It seems id_rsa.pub doesn't have a header like id_rsa, so I am not sure if I should also transfer this.
