I'm trying to add swagger-ui (OpenAPI 3.0) to a Spring Boot v3 application.

I've added the openapi-ui maven dependency, and it should work as per the documentation.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
    <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-ui</artifactId>
    <version>1.6.11</version>
</dependency>
```

But apparently, it still doesn't work and localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html returns an 404 error.

What am I missing?
