According with the Microsoft Documentation Here, I should have access to the Attribute for [Keyless] so I can define my Model has Keyless, so that in my DBContext I could have something like:
```c#
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```
And use
```c#
_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)
```
without having the need to add a PK to it. I have the reference to
```c#
System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations
```
and all the Attributes except Keyless are there, what am I missing here?
