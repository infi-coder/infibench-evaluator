I recently started to give tailwind.css a try in my Nuxt project. Here is my code:

```html
  <ul>
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      class="border-solid border-b border-black"
    >
      Item
    </li>
  </ul>
```

I want to add a border-bottom to all of the <li> except the last one. I know Tailwind has first & last pseudo-class variant. What should I do? Could you help me to output a revised code to realize this style?
