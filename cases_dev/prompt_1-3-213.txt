ExcelWriter ValueError: Excel does not support datetime with timezone when saving df to Excel

I'm running on this issue for quite a while now.

I set the writer as follows:

```python
writer = pd.ExcelWriter(arquivo+'.xlsx', engine = 'xlsxwriter', options = {'remove_timezone': True})
df.to_excel(writer, header = True, index = True)
```

The problem is every time I run the code, it gets information from the database, which contains two columns datetime64[ns, UTC] object with time zone info. But when the code to save to Excel runs I receive:

```bash
ValueError: Excel does not support datetimes with timezones. Please ensure that datetimes are timezone unaware before writing to Excel.
```

I have already tried several things like `dt.tz_convert, `replace(tzinfo=None)` and other solutions I have found here and around.

The code runs without problem in my personal computer, my colleague at work with the same machine specs can run the code. Only in my machine it doesn't. I already reinstalled python and all the packages, including formatting the machine and nothing, the error persists.

xlrd v1.1.0

xlsxwriter v1.0.4

python 3.7.4

pandas v0.25.1

Please write a function `removeTimezone` in Python, which takes a DataFrame variable `df` as the argument and returns `df` with the column "time" removed timezones.

Function signature is: `removeTimezone(df)`
