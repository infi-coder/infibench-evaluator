I'm trying to create a function that turns text into pig Latin: simple text transformation that modifies each word moving the first character to the end and appending "ay" to the end. But all I get is an empty list.

My python code:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
  say = ""
  words = text.split()
  for word in words:
    endString = str(word[1]).upper()+str(word[2:])
    them = endString, str(word[0:1]).lower(), 'ay'
    word = ''.join(them)
    return word

print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

Please generate the function pig_latin in Python by revising my code. You need only generate the function, without any comments or testing codes.
