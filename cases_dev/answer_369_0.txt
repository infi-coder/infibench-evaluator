In order to make it work, you need to:

Have devtools enable in maven or gradle. In maven it looks like :

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
     <scope>runtime</scope><!-- -->
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
```

In IntellijIDEA: go in settings(ctrl +alt+s) -> Build,Execution,Deployment -> compiler, check "Build project automatically"

Enable option 'allow auto-make to start even if developed application is currently running' in Settings -> Advanced Settings under compiler
