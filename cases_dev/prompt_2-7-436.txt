Tying to install a Laravel 9 project.

Updated Composer from 2.0.8 to 2.3.10

Running
```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.*"
```

Gives me :
```
Could not find package laravel/laravel with version 9.* in a version installable using your PHP version, PHP extens ions and Composer version.
