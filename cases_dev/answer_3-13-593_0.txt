Jetpack compose requires a minSdkVersion of at least 21. So add/update the following in your app/build.gradle file
android{
   //...
   defaultConfig {
      minSdkVersion 21
      targetSdkVersion 29
      //...
   }
  //...
 }
Also you need to use Android studio (from canary channel) in order to use jetpack-compose with the latest features.
