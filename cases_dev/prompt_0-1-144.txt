I am using an accordion componnent from bootstrap 5. Here is my code: 

```html
<div class="accordion pb-3" id="accordionExample">
    <div class="accordion-item">
        <h2 class="accordion-header" id="headingOne">
            <button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne" style="background-color: red;border:0">
                name and surname
            </button>
        </h2>
        <div id="collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample" style="background-color: red;">
            <div class="accordion-body">
                This is aółóźńthe first item's accordion body.It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

It works fine but I would like to change the acoordion arrow color to green. How to do this in css?
