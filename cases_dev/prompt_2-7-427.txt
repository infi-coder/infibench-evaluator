I am working on a laravel application. Upon hosting it on my domain, I am running into a "CSRF token mismatch" error. Locally, the application is working fine because I have included the csrf token in the header as shown in the documentation. Therefore, the csrf token is being generated successfully and being included in the header of requests. On doing some debugging, I changed the SESSION_DRIVER in env file to file so that I can see the sessions. I realized that multiple sessions are being generated for one user. The SESSION_LIFETIME is set to 120, which I believe is okay. In looking at the tokens in the sessions stored in storage/framework/sessions, none contains the token that is generated by the browser. What could be the issue? Remember that it is working fine locally. What configurations on the host domain could be affecting the sessions of the application.

I have a project that has a module that sends email from request. Im using beautymail package for the email template. I can send an email using a gmail account, but there is this email that I get from my client that has a custome email address in it. Like this xx.xxxxx@propnex.sg, they said that the email is a smtp server. So I tried configuring my .env and other configuration files in laravel. But I get this error upon sending Connection could not be established with host mail.propnex.sg :stream_socket_client(): SSL operation failed with code 1. OpenSSL Error messages: error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number Could someone tell me why Im getting this error and what should I do to get rid of this?
