Complete the function ```vector<pair<int, int>> origin_to_goal(vector<int> origin)```.
The function creat a vector of pairs, where each pair contains always two elements, from a single even-sized vector in C++ without simple loops.
It can be assumed that the original vector always contains an even amount of elements.
Using a nice standard-library tool for this (if you can).
Example:
```c++
vector<int> origin = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
vector<pair<int, int>> goal = origin_to_goal(origin); //{ {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}, {7, 8} };
```
Return the implementation of origin_to_goal, without any other information.
