How to set a field in a struct with an empty value in Rust?
I am writing a TCP client and have a `conn` field in my client struct. My client implements two methods `new` to instantiate the struct and connect to open a connection to the server and set that as the value of the `conn` field.
```rust
pub struct FistClient {
    addr: String,
    conn: TcpStream,
}

impl FistClient {
    pub fn new(ip: &str, port: &str) -> Self {
        FistClient {
            addr: String::from(ip) + ":" + &String::from(port),
            // conn: <some-defaullt-value>,
        }
    }

    pub fn connect(&mut self, ip: &str, port: &str) {
        let res = TcpStream::connect(&self.addr);
        match res {
            Ok(c) => self.conn = c,
            Err(_) => panic!(),
        }
    }
}
```
I want to set the `conn` field in the new method to some default value. How to do it in Rust?
