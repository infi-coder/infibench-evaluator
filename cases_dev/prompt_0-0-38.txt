In Angular, I try to subscribe to an Observable and assign some data from the response, but somehow my code is not waiting for the response. Basically `console.log(this.newIds)`` runs first and is always empty because the subscribe doesn't wait for response to come from the backend. How I can force my code to wait for the response to come?

Here is my code:

```javascript
 this.repository.getById(Ids).subscribe((response) => {
      console.log(response);
      this.newIds = response.map((id) => {
        return id;
      });
    });
console.log(this.newIds);
```

Could you help me to revise the code? You just need to output the revised code snippet without further explanation.
