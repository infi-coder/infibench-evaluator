After bundle update my Rails app fails to boot with:
Expected to find a manifest file in `app/assets/config/manifest.js` (Sprockets::Railtie::ManifestNeededError).
How to solve this error?
Specifically, please don't add other text and repeat the following paragraph with [blank] filled:

Step1. Create the [blank] file
```
$ mkdir -p app/assets/config 
$ touch app/assets/config/[blank]
```
Step2. Then copy and paste the following into the file you just created:
```
//= link_tree ../images
//= link_directory ../javascripts .js
//= link_directory ../stylesheets .css
```
Those commenty things //= are called [blank].
