How to write a list of list into excel using python 3?

```python
new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
with open("file_name.csv", 'w') as f:
    fc = csv.writer(f, lineterminator='\n')
fc.writerows(new_list)
```

I can write this list into csv file but How canI want to write in excel file?

Please write a function `writeToExcel` in Python, which create an excel file named "data.xlsx" and write the above contents into the file.

Function signature is: `writeExcel()`
