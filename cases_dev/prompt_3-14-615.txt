Get the current scroll position of a SwiftUI ScrollView

With the new `ScrollViewReader`, it seems possible to set the scroll offset programmatically.
But I was wondering if it is also possible to  the current scroll position?
It seems like the `ScrollViewProxy` only comes with the `scrollTo` method, allowing us to set the offset.
Thanks!
