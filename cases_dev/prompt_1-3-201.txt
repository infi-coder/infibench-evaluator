i have two files, and i want to run both. The first one is basically asking down the prices of stocks and writes them to a database, and the second one using python dash to create a webpage. This webpage is showing the data in real time from the database which is constantly refreshes. I tried to use threading but it does not work, because the two files basically function as two infinite while loop. How should i solve this problem? The two functions im having problem with are `dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)` and `if name == "main": app.run_server(debug=True)`

```python
app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
database=db.dataBase()
homepage=hp.homepage(database)
homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()



if __name__ == "__main__":
   app.run_server(debug=True)
```
