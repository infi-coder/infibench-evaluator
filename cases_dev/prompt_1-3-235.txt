I have a dataframe with a column named "year" in object format. I want to convert object to int but I have this error :

```bash
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2021.0'
```

Here is my code : 

```python
data_h_df['year'].astype(str).astype(int)
```

Please write a function `transformation` in Python which takes `data_h_df` as argument and returns `data_h_df` with the "year" column transformed.

The signature of the function is transformation(data_h_df)
