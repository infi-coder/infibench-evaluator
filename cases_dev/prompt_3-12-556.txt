Flutter : PlatformException(no_available_camera, No cameras available for taking pictures., null, null).
It happened after I merged my projects. It says there is no camera available but back then it was running fine.
Please have a look at this error message and help in this.
Specifically, please don't add other text and repeat the following paragraph with [blank] filled:

If your compileSdkVersion and [blank] is [blank] (or above), then add the [blank] info to your [blank] file, directly under the manifest tag:
```
<manifest package=\"com.example\">
    <queries>
        <intent>
            <action android:name=\"[blank]\" />
        </intent>
    </queries>
    ...
</manifest>
```
