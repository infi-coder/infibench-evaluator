How to sort a list alphabetically?

It is necessary to create a list of random letters of the alphabet. And then sort it alphabetically. To create such a list, I use the following code:

```r
# Creating a random vector of letters
random_text_data = sample(letters, 10)
random_text_data

# Convert to list
list_text_data = as.list(random_text_data)
list_text_data
```

In the console I get the following:

```r
> random_text_data
[1] "h" "m" "q" "b" "z" "i" "y" "f" "d" "e"
> # Convert to list
> list_text_data = as.list(random_text_data)
> list_text_data
[[1]]
[1] "h"

[[2]]
[1] "m"

[[3]]
[1] "q"

[[4]]
[1] "b"

[[5]]
[1] "z"

[[6]]
[1] "i"

[[7]]
[1] "y"

[[8]]
[1] "f"

[[9]]
[1] "d"

[[10]]
[1] "e"
```

Now I need to sort it alphabetically. I have tried the following:

```r
# Sort list alphabetically
sort_data = sort(list_text_data)
```

But get error:

```
> sort_data = sort(list_text_data)
Error in sort.int(x, na.last = na.last, decreasing = decreasing, ...) :
'x' must be elementary
```

How should you sort?

Please write a function `mySort` in R, which takes a list `l` as the argument and returns what I need.

Function signature is: `mySort <- function(l)`
