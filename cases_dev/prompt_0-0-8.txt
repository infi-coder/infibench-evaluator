In javascript, given a JSON nested object tree like the following, how to find the specific object (subtree) by passing an `id`` value to a function. `id` is a key in all nested objects.

The nested object tree example:
```javascript
{
    "id": "A",
    "name": "Item A",
    "child": [
        {
            "id": "B",
            "name": "Item B",
            "child": [
                {
                    "id": "C",
                    "name": "Item C"
                    "child": []
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "id": "D",
            "name": "Item D",
            "child": []
        }
    ]
}
```

You are required to write a function `findObject(id, root_node)` that returns the object. In the above example, the execution result of `findObject("C", root_node)` should be:

```javascript
{
  "id": "C",
  "name": "Item C"
  "child": []
}
```

The object is guaranteed to be existing and unique when the function is called. Could you help me to implement this function? Just output the function without any other things.
