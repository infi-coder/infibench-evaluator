I am using Jest tests to test an API class in a React app. The API class is defined in a class file `utils/API` like so:

```javascript
class API {
  someMethod() {
    // Does stuff
  }
}

export default API;
```

I mock this class with the following code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  // Returns an object
  return {
    someMethod: () => {}
  };
})
```

However, `const api = new API()` after the mock code throws a `TypeError... is not a constructor`` error.

Could you revise the above snippet to eliminate the error? 
You don't need to output other context, but just the revised version of the above code snippet.
