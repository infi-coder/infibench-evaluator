From your code, it seems like you're doing everything correctly. However, there are a few things you can check when you're having issues with Apollo Client's `useQuery`:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. Apollo Client's `useQuery` fetches data over the network, so a lack of internet connection could cause it to hang indefinitely.

2. **Server Status**: Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can do this by visiting the URL in a web browser or using a tool like Postman to send a request.

3. **GraphQL Query**: Make sure that your GraphQL query is correct. You can test your query directly on the GraphQL server if it has a playground (like GraphQL's GraphiQL interface). The server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' seems to have one, so you can test your query there.

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to an earlier version to see if that resolves the issue.

5. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, try disabling it. There have been some reports of the debugger causing issues with network requests.

6. **Error Handling**: You might be getting an error that you're not handling. Try logging the error object to see if it contains any useful information.

7. **React Native Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of React Native you're using. Try upgrading or downgrading to see if that resolves the issue.

If none of these suggestions work, you might want to consider posting an issue on the Apollo Client GitHub page. The maintainers or other users might be able to help you out.
