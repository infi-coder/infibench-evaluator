Your code seems fine, but the problem might be that you're trying to test the `@Binding` in the `PreviewProvider`. The `PreviewProvider` doesn't actually run your code, it just provides a static preview of your views. 

To test your `@Binding`, you should create a parent view that owns the `@State` and passes it as a `@Binding` to `ContentView`. Here's an example:

```swift
struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var selected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $selected)
    }
}
```

Then, run your app in the simulator or on a device to see the changes in `ContentView` when the button is clicked.
