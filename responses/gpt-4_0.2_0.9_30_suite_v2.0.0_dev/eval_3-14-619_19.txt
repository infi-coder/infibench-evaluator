Your code seems correct, but the problem might be that you're trying to observe the change in `ContentView_Previews` which is just for previewing the UI in Xcode and not for actual runtime behavior.

If you want to test the behavior of the `isSelected` state, you should create another view that owns the `@State` and passes the `@Binding` to `ContentView`. Here's an example:

```swift
struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var isSelected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $isSelected)
    }
}
```

Now, when you run `ParentView`, you should see the `isSelected` state change when the button in `ContentView` is clicked.
