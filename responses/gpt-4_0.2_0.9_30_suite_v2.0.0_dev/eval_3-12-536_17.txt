You can use `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton`, and `TextButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property. 

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with a border radius in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {},
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20), // 20 is the radius value
    ),
  ),
  child: Text('Rounded Button'),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton` is the button theme, `shape` is the property that you change to make the button rounded, and `style` is the property where `shape` is placed. You can replace `ElevatedButton` with `OutlinedButton` or `TextButton` depending on your needs. The `borderRadius` is set to 20, but you can adjust this value to get the desired roundness.
