The error you're getting is because the `sort()` function in R doesn't work directly on lists. However, you can unlist the list, sort it, and then convert it back to a list. Here's how you can do it:

```r
mySort <- function(l) {
  # Unlist the list
  unlisted_l <- unlist(l)
  
  # Sort the unlisted data
  sorted_l <- sort(unlisted_l)
  
  # Convert back to list
  sorted_list <- as.list(sorted_l)
  
  return(sorted_list)
}
```

You can use this function to sort your list as follows:

```r
sorted_data = mySort(list_text_data)
```

This will return your list sorted in alphabetical order.
