Sure, here is a bash script that will install Python 3.6.5 using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current python version
brew unlink python

# Install python 3.6.5
brew install python@3.6

# Link python 3.6.5
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will unlink your current Python version. If you have any other Python versions installed, you may need to adjust the script accordingly.
