Sure, I can help with that. The issue with your code is that you're checking if the entire input string is within the `correct` string, not if each individual character is within `correct`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    for char in text:
        if char not in correct:
            return False
    return True
```

This function will return `True` if all characters in the input string are either a letter (uppercase or lowercase) or a digit, and `False` otherwise.
