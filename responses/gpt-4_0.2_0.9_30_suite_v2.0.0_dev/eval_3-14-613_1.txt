This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being associated with a target. Here are some steps to fix this:

1. Open your SwiftUI file.
2. Click on the filename in the breadcrumb navigation at the top of the editor.
3. Click on "Target Membership" in the right sidebar.
4. Make sure your app target is checked.

If the issue persists, try these additional steps:

1. Clean your build folder (Product > Clean Build Folder).
2. Delete derived data (Xcode > Preferences > Locations > Derived Data > Delete).
3. Restart Xcode.

If none of these solutions work, it might be a bug in Xcode 12.3. You could try updating to a newer version of Xcode if available.
