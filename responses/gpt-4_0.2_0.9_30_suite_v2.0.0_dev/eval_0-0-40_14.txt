The problem you're encountering is due to the fact that your system is trying to use the Windows version of `npm` instead of the one installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu environment. This is because the Windows path is included in your WSL2 path.

To solve this issue, you need to remove the Windows path from your WSL2 path. You can do this by editing your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file.

Here are the steps:

1. Open your `.bashrc` file in a text editor. You can use `nano` for this:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:

   ```bash
   export PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed -e 's/:\/mnt.*//g')
   ```

   This command removes the Windows path from your WSL2 path.

3. Save the file and exit the editor. If you're using `nano`, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

4. Reload your `.bashrc` file to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

5. Now, when you run `npm -v`, it should use the `npm` installed in your WSL2 environment.

If you still encounter issues, you might need to reinstall `nodejs` and `npm` in your WSL2 environment:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove -y nodejs npm
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

This will remove the existing `nodejs` and `npm`, then install the latest LTS version of `nodejs`, which includes `npm`.
