The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` suggests that npm is unable to find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry. 

This could be due to a typo in the package name. The correct package name for the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`. 

Try running `npm install aws-sdk` instead of `npm install aws-sdk-js` and see if that resolves the issue.
