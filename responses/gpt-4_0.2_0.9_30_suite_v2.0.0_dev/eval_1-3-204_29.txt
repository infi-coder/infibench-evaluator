The issue you're facing is because the `rename` function is being called on a `Series` object, not a `DataFrame` object. The `groupby` operation followed by the mean calculation returns a `Series` object, not a `DataFrame`. The `rename` function behaves differently for `Series` and `DataFrame` objects.

For `Series` objects, `rename` function is used to change the `Series` name. For `DataFrame` objects, `rename` function is used to change the `DataFrame` column names or index names.

Here is the correct way to rename the column in your case:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg.columns = ['t', 'mean']
    return avg
```

In this function, we first reset the index of the `Series` object returned by the `groupby` operation. This converts the `Series` object to a `DataFrame` object. Then we rename the columns of the `DataFrame` object.

This function will return a new `DataFrame` where the "t" column contains the unique values from the original "t" column and the "mean" column contains the mean of "p" values for each unique "t" value.
