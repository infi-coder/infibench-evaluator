The `navigator.geolocation` object is available in most modern browsers, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the user has granted permission for location access. The `getCurrentPosition` method is asynchronous and takes two callback functions as arguments: the first one is called when the location is successfully obtained, and the second one is called when an error occurs.

Here's how you can modify your code to handle both cases:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the user denies access to their location, the error callback will be invoked and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console. If the `navigator.geolocation` object is not available at all (which could be the case in some older browsers), "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged.
