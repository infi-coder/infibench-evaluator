The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It's part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace.

To use it, you need to install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` NuGet package and add the following using directive at the top of your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Then you can use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class:

```csharp
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    // properties
}
```

And in your `DbContext`:

```csharp
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

You can then use the `FromSqlRaw` method without needing to add a primary key to your model:

```csharp
_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)
```

Please make sure that you have the appropriate version of Entity Framework Core that supports the `[Keyless]` attribute. It was introduced in EF Core 5.0. If you're using a version prior to 5.0, you won't have access to this attribute.
