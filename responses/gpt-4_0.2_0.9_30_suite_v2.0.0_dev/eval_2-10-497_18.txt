In Rust, you don't have null pointers like in C or C++. Instead, you have the `Option` type, which can be `Some` or `None`. `None` is used to represent the absence of a value, similar to how you might use a null pointer in other languages.

Here's how you can modify your code to use `Option`:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

In this code, `Option<Box<Node>>` means that `next` and `top` can either be `Some(Box<Node>)` (i.e., they have a value) or `None` (i.e., they don't have a value).

To check if `top` is `None`, you can use the `is_none` method:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    // top is None
}
```

And to check if `top` is `Some`, you can use the `is_some` method:

```rust
if stack.top.is_some() {
    // top is Some
}
```

You can also use pattern matching to handle `Some` and `None` cases:

```rust
match stack.top {
    Some(node) => {
        // top is Some
    },
    None => {
        // top is None
    },
}
```
