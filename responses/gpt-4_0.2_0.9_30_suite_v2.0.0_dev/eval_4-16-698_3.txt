You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, this should apply them to your current terminal session.

If you're using a different shell, you'd source that file instead. For example, if you're using zsh, you'd use:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

If you want to completely restart your shell, you can use `exec` command followed by `$SHELL`:

```bash
exec $SHELL
```

This will replace the current shell with a new one.
