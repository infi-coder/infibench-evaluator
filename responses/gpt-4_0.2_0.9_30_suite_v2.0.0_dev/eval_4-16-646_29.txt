The error you're seeing is because the `pdftk` binary you're trying to use is not compatible with the architecture of your Mac's CPU. This is a common issue on Macs with the Catalina OS and later, as they dropped support for 32-bit applications.

Here's a solution using Homebrew:

1. Uninstall the current `pdftk`:

    ```bash
    brew uninstall pdftk
    ```

2. Tap the cask for `pdftk-java`:

    ```bash
    brew tap spl/pdftk
    ```

3. Install `pdftk-java`:

    ```bash
    brew install pdftk-java
    ```

Now, you should be able to use `pdftk` as before. Note that `pdftk-java` is a version of `pdftk` ported to work with Java, so it should be compatible with your Mac's CPU.

If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it with the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
