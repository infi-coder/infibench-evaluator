Font Awesome 5 has a different way of handling icons, and the font-family has been split into different styles. For example, "Font Awesome 5 Free" for solid icons, "Font Awesome 5 Brands" for brand icons, and "Font Awesome 5 Regular" for regular icons.

Here is how you can modify your CSS to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* Change this to the appropriate font family */
  font-weight: 900; /* Add this for solid icons */
}
```

Please note that the `font-weight` property is used to choose the style of the icon. Use `400` for Regular style and `900` for Solid style. If you are using a brand icon, you should set the `font-family` to "Font Awesome 5 Brands" and you don't need to set a `font-weight`.

Also, make sure that the unicode you are using (`\f107` in this case) corresponds to the correct icon in Font Awesome 5, as some icons have different unicodes compared to Font Awesome 4. You can check the correct unicode on the Font Awesome website.
