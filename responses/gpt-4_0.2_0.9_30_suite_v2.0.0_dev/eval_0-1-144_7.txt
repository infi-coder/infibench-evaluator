The accordion arrow in Bootstrap 5 is created using a CSS pseudo-element `::after`. You can change its color by targeting this pseudo-element in your CSS. Here's how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may want to include vendor prefixes for older browsers */
    color: green;
}
```

This will change the color of the arrow to green. If you want to change the color of the arrow only when the accordion is collapsed, you can use the `.collapsed` class:

```css
.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    color: green;
}
```

This will change the color of the arrow to green only when the accordion is collapsed. When the accordion is expanded, the arrow will have its default color.

Please note that the color property might not work depending on the Bootstrap version and the way the arrow is implemented. If the arrow is implemented as a background image, you might need to replace the image or use a CSS filter to change its color.
