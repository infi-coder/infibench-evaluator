The issue is with the single quotes around your variable `$searchT`. In bash, single quotes will treat the enclosed characters literally, not as a variable. You should use double quotes instead.

Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

Also, note that I moved `| wc -l` to count the lines after the grep command. This will give you the correct count of matches.
