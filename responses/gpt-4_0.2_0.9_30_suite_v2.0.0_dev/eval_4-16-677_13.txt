The issue you're facing is due to the use of single quotes around the `$searchT` variable in your `grep` command. In bash, single quotes preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes, meaning your variable isn't being expanded to its value.

To fix this, you should use double quotes instead. Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")
else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

This script will now correctly substitute the value of `$searchT` into your `grep` command. Also, I've moved the `wc -l` command to correctly count the number of matches found.
