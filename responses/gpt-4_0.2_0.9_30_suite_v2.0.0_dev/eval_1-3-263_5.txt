The `f` in `print(f"...")` is used to denote a f-string (formatted string literal) in Python. It was introduced in Python 3.6 as a new way of formatting strings.

The f-string is prefixed with 'f' and contains expressions inside curly braces `{}`. The expressions are replaced with their values when the string is printed. 

In your example:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

`{args.input_directory}` and `{args.output_directory}` are expressions. When the f-string is printed, these expressions are replaced with the values of `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` respectively.

So, if `args.input_directory` is `/home/user/input` and `args.output_directory` is `/home/user/output`, the printed output would be:

```
Input directory: /home/user/input
Output directory: /home/user/output
```
