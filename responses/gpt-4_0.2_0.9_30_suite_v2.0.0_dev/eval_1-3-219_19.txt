There could be several reasons why you are unable to start a Jupyter notebook on VS Code. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try:

1. **Check your Python interpreter**: Make sure you're using the correct Python interpreter. You can select the interpreter by clicking on the Python version in the bottom-left corner of the status bar or by using the `Python: Select Interpreter` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

2. **Check your Jupyter server**: Try to start your Jupyter server manually from the command line using the command `jupyter notebook`. If it starts successfully, then the problem might be with VS Code.

3. **Check your Python and Jupyter installations**: Make sure your Python and Jupyter installations are correct and up-to-date. You can check this by running `python --version` and `jupyter --version` in the command line.

4. **Reinstall the Python extension**: Try uninstalling and reinstalling the Python extension in VS Code.

5. **Check your VS Code settings**: Make sure your VS Code settings are correct. You can check this by going to `File > Preferences > Settings` and searching for `Python`.

6. **Check your environment**: Make sure your `da38` environment is correctly set up and contains all the necessary packages. You can check this by activating the environment (`conda activate da38`) and running `conda list`.

7. **Check your ipykernel package**: Try reinstalling the `ipykernel` package in your `da38` environment. You can do this by activating the environment (`conda activate da38`) and running `pip uninstall ipykernel` followed by `pip install ipykernel`.

If none of these steps work, please provide more information about your setup and the exact error message you're seeing.
