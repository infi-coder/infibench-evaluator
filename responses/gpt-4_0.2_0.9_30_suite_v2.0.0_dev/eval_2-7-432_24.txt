The "419 Page Expired" error is a CSRF token mismatch issue. When you log out from one tab, Laravel invalidates the session and the CSRF token associated with it. So, when you try to log out from the second tab, the CSRF token sent with the request doesn't match with the one stored in the session (since the session is already invalidated), and hence the error.

To handle this, you can catch the `TokenMismatchException` in your `Handler.php` file and redirect the user to the login page. Here's how you can do it:

```php
// app/Exceptions/Handler.php

use Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException;

public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof TokenMismatchException) {
        // Redirect to a form. Here is an example of how we can
        // redirect to the login page if the CSRF token is expired
        return redirect('/login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

This way, if a user tries to perform an action with an expired CSRF token, they will be redirected to the login page instead of seeing the "419 Page Expired" error.
