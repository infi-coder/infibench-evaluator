In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, the column names of the resulting data frame are made unique by adding a suffix. 

In your case, the column names of `d3` would be `a` and `a.1`. So, to select the second column by name, you can use `d3$a.1`.

Here is the code to assign the second column to a variable named `second_col`:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

However, if the column names are not made unique (which is unusual), you can select the second column by its index:

```r
second_col <- d3[,2]
```

This will select the second column regardless of its name.
