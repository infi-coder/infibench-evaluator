In Rust, `Box<T>` is a smart pointer that cannot be null. If you want to have an optional `Box<T>`, you should use `Option<Box<T>>`. When the `Option` is `None`, it's like having a null pointer in other languages.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

In this case, `None` represents a null pointer. You can check if the `Box<Node>` is null by checking if the `Option` is `None`:

```rust
if let Some(node) = &stack.top {
    // The Box<Node> is not null.
} else {
    // The Box<Node> is null.
}
```

Or using `is_none()` and `is_some()` methods:

```rust
if stack.top.is_some() {
    // The Box<Node> is not null.
} else {
    // The Box<Node> is null.
}
```

This is a more idiomatic way to handle null pointers in Rust.
