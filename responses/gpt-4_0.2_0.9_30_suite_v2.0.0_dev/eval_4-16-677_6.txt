The problem is that you are using single quotes around `$searchT` in your `grep` command. Single quotes in bash will prevent variable expansion, meaning `$searchT` is treated as a literal string, not a variable. 

You should use double quotes instead, which will allow for variable expansion. Here is the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

This script will now correctly search for the term you input in `test.txt` and output the number of matches found. If no matches are found, it will output "no match found".
