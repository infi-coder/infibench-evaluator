Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. You are trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as objects, but you are assigning them string values. You should declare them as `String` instead of `WorkbookQuery` and `Worksheet` respectively.

2. The `query` variable is assigned the value of a cell, but you are trying to use it as a `WorkbookQuery` object. If you want to use the text from a cell as a query, you should assign it to the `CommandText` property of the `QueryTable` object.

3. The `Location` property in the connection string should be the name of the query, not the query itself.

Here's a revised version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As String

    ' Get the query from a cell
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value
    currentSheet = ActiveSheet.Name

    ' Create a new ListObject with a QueryTable
    With ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=Query1" _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array(query)
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

In this code, `Query1` is the name of the query in Power Query. You should replace it with the actual name of your query.
