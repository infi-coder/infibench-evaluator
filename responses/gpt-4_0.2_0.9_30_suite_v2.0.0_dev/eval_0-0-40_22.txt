The problem you're encountering is due to the fact that you have two versions of Node.js installed: one on your Windows system and one on your WSL2 Ubuntu system. When you run `npm -v`, it's trying to use the Windows version of npm, which won't work because of the different file system and environment.

To solve this problem, you need to make sure that the Ubuntu version of Node.js and npm are being used. You can do this by modifying your `PATH` environment variable.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `.bashrc` file in a text editor. You can do this by running the command `nano ~/.bashrc`.

2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:

    ```bash
    export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
    ```

    This line will prioritize the `/usr/bin` directory (where your Ubuntu version of Node.js and npm are located) over other directories in your `PATH`.

3. Save the file and exit the editor. If you're using `nano`, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

4. Reload your `.bashrc` file by running the command `source ~/.bashrc`.

5. Now, when you run `node -v` and `npm -v`, you should see the versions that are installed on your Ubuntu system.

Remember, this solution assumes that you want to use the Ubuntu version of Node.js and npm. If you want to use the Windows version, you'll need to do it outside of WSL2.
