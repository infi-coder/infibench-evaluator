You should use `@Configuration` when you want to define beans explicitly in the code. It is typically used in situations where you need to create Spring Beans using third-party classes that you can't annotate with `@Component`, `@Service`, or `@Controller`.

On the other hand, `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Component` are used to auto-detect and auto-configure beans using classpath scanning. They are typically used for defining beans for your own classes.

In summary, use `@Configuration` for explicit, programmatic bean definitions, especially for third-party classes. Use `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Component` for auto-detection and auto-configuration of your own classes.
