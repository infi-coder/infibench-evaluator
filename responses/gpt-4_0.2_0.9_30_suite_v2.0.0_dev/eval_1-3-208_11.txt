Sure, I can help you with that. The problem with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, not if each character in the input string is in the `correct` string. 

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)
```

This function uses the `all` function, which returns `True` if all elements of the iterable are true. In this case, the iterable is a generator expression that checks if each character in `text` is in `correct`. If any character is not in `correct`, `all` will return `False`.

You can use this function like this:

```python
text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

This will print "Success" if all characters in the input are letters or digits, and "Failure" otherwise.
