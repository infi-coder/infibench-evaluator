Your code seems fine at first glance. However, there are a few things you could check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator has a stable internet connection. Sometimes, the loading state persists because the request to the server is not going through due to network issues.

2. **Server Status**: Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can do this by pasting the URL into your web browser and seeing if it loads. If the server is down, the query will not be able to fetch any data.

3. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (like 3.3.7) and see if the problem persists.

4. **Query Syntax**: Ensure that your GraphQL query is correct. If there's a syntax error in your query, the server might not be able to process it, resulting in a persistent loading state.

5. **Error Handling**: It's possible that an error is occurring but not being caught because it's not being thrown in a way that the `error` variable can catch. Try adding a `.catch` block to your query to see if there are any uncaught errors.

6. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, there might be an issue with the network inspect. Try disabling it and see if the problem persists.

If none of these solutions work, it would be helpful to see any error messages you're getting in your console. This could provide more insight into what's causing the issue.
