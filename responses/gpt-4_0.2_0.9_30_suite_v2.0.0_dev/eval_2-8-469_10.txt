The error message indicates that `protoc-gen-go` is unable to determine the Go import path for your `simple.proto` file. This can be resolved by specifying a `go_package` option in your .proto source file.

Here's how you can modify your proto file:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "github.com/yourusername/yourrepository"; // replace with your package's import path

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

In the `go_package` option, you should replace `"github.com/yourusername/yourrepository"` with the actual Go import path where your generated Go code will live.

After you've added the `go_package` option, you should be able to generate the Go code for your proto file without any issues.
