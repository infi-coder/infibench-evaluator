The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to use `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` before `runApp()` has been called. This is a problem because `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` needs Flutter's engine to be initialized, which happens when `runApp()` is called.

To fix this, you can use `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`. This method ensures that the Flutter engine is initialized. Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

By calling `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`, you're making sure that the Flutter engine is ready before you try to get the application documents directory.
