It seems like there's a misunderstanding. There is no "Developer Mode" to enable on iOS like there is on Android. 

However, the alert you're seeing is likely related to the provisioning profile used to sign the app. If the app was signed with a developer provisioning profile, it can only be installed on devices that are registered with the Apple Developer account that was used to create the provisioning profile.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Register your device's UDID with the Apple Developer account used to create the provisioning profile. You can find your device's UDID by connecting it to a computer, opening iTunes, selecting the device, and clicking on the serial number to reveal the UDID.

2. Once your device is registered, you'll need to create a new provisioning profile that includes your device, download it, and use it to sign the app.

3. You can then install the app on your device. If the app was built and signed correctly, you should be able to open it without seeing the alert.

If you're not the developer of the app, you'll need to contact the developer and ask them to add your device to their Apple Developer account and re-sign the app. 

If you're trying to install an app from a source other than the App Store and you're not a developer, you might be able to use a service like TestFlight, which allows developers to distribute beta versions of their apps. However, the developer will still need to invite you to test the app.
