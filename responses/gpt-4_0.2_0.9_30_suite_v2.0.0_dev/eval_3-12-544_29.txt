The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to access platform-specific code before `runApp()` is called. The `runApp()` function initializes the binding with the host platform, which is necessary for the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` function to work.

To fix this, you should move your code inside the `main()` function to the `initState()` method of your root widget. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initHive();
  }

  Future<void> initHive() async {
    final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
    // You can also open your Hive boxes here if needed.
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Your widget tree here.
  }
}
```

In this example, the `initHive()` function is called from the `initState()` method of the `MyApp` widget. This ensures that the platform channels are properly initialized before you try to access the application documents directory.
