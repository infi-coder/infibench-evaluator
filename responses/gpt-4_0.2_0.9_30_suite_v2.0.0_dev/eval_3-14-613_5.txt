This error can occur when the SwiftUI preview is not associated with any target. Here's how you can fix it:

1. Open your SwiftUI file.
2. Click on the file name in the top center of Xcode.
3. In the file inspector on the right, under "Target Membership", make sure your app's target is checked.

If the target is already checked, try the following:

1. Clean your build folder by going to `Product -> Clean Build Folder`.
2. Close Xcode.
3. Delete derived data. You can find the location of your derived data folder in `Xcode -> Preferences -> Locations`.
4. Reopen Xcode and try again.

If none of these work, it might be a bug in Xcode. You can report it to Apple via their Feedback Assistant.
