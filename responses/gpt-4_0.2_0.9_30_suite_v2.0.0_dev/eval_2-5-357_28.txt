Yes, you're correct. Since Spring 4.3, if a class, which is annotated with `@Component` or `@Service` or `@Repository`, contains a single constructor, the `@Autowired` annotation on that constructor is no longer necessary. Spring will use that constructor for autowiring by default.

People might still use `@Autowired` on constructors due to habit, or because they are working with a codebase that uses an older version of Spring, or for explicitness and clarity.

However, if the class has multiple constructors, Spring won't know which one to use, so you'll need to add `@Autowired` to the constructor you want Spring to use for autowiring.
