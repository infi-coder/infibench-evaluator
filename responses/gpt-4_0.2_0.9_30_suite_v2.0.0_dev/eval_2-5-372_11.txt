It seems like you are facing a version conflict issue. The error message indicates that Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2 is being used, but the `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations are part of the Bean Validation 2.0 specification, which is supported starting from Hibernate Validator 6.0.0.Final.

Spring Boot 2.0.4.RELEASE should already include Hibernate Validator 6.0.11.Final, which supports Bean Validation 2.0. However, it seems that JBoss is loading an older version of Hibernate Validator.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if JBoss is bundling an older version of Hibernate Validator. If it is, try to upgrade it or remove it if possible.

2. If you cannot upgrade or remove the Hibernate Validator bundled with JBoss, you can try to isolate your application from the server's libraries. In JBoss, this can be done by jboss-deployment-structure.xml file. Here is an example:

```xml
<jboss-deployment-structure>
    <deployment>
        <exclusions>
            <module name="org.hibernate.validator" />
        </exclusions>
    </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
```

This file should be placed in the `WEB-INF` directory of your WAR file. This tells JBoss not to use its bundled Hibernate Validator for your application.

3. If none of the above solutions work, you might consider downgrading your validation annotations to match the Hibernate Validator version that JBoss is using. For example, you can use `@NotNull` and `@Size(min=1)` instead of `@NotEmpty` or `@NotBlank`. This is not an ideal solution because it does not fully utilize the Bean Validation 2.0 specification, but it might be a practical workaround if you cannot upgrade or isolate the Hibernate Validator in JBoss.
