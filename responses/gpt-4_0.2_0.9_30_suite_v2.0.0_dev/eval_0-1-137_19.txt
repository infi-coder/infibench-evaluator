The error you're getting is because you're trying to import the Bootstrap variables before you declare your own. This causes the Bootstrap variables to overwrite your own.

Here's how you can fix it:

```scss
// Define your custom colors first
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #123456 // replace with your color
);

// Then import Bootstrap's variables and mixins
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins";

// Then import the rest of Bootstrap
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

In this way, your custom colors will be used instead of the default ones. Make sure to replace `#123456` with the color you want to use.

Also, note that you need to import `functions.scss` and `mixins.scss` before `variables.scss` because `variables.scss` may depend on functions or mixins defined in those files.
