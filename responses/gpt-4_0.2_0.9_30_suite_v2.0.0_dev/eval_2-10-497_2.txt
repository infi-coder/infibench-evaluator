In Rust, the `Box<T>` type is a smart pointer that points to data on the heap. It's important to note that `Box<T>` cannot be null. When you have a `Box<T>`, you are guaranteed that it points to some valid value of type `T`. This is a feature of Rust that helps prevent null pointer bugs.

However, you can use `Option<Box<T>>` to represent a nullable box. Here's how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

In this code, `Option<Box<Node>>` is used to represent a nullable `Box<Node>`. The `Option` type is an enum that can be either `Some(T)` or `None`, where `T` is the type of the value it is "wrapping". In this case, `T` is `Box<Node>`. `Some(Box<Node>)` means that there is a `Box<Node>`, and `None` means that there is not.

You can check if an `Option<Box<Node>>` is null by using the `is_none()` method:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    println!("The stack is empty");
} else {
    println!("The stack is not empty");
}
```

Or you can use pattern matching:

```rust
match stack.top {
    Some(_) => println!("The stack is not empty"),
    None => println!("The stack is empty"),
}
```

In both of these examples, `stack` is assumed to be an instance of `Stack`.
