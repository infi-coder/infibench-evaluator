To enable Developer Mode on an iOS device, you need to pair the device with Xcode on your Mac. Here are the steps:

1. Connect your iOS device to your Mac using a USB cable.

2. Open Xcode on your Mac.

3. In Xcode, go to `Window` -> `Devices and Simulators`.

4. In the Devices and Simulators window, you will see your device listed in the left sidebar under "Connected". If you don't see your device, make sure it's connected properly and unlocked.

5. Click on your device in the list, this will open the device's information.

6. Check the box that says `Connect via network`. This allows Xcode to communicate with your device over your local network when it's not connected via USB.

7. Now, you should see a "Use for Development" button. Click on it. If you don't see this button, try disconnecting and reconnecting your device, or restarting Xcode.

8. If prompted, enter your Apple ID and password that you use for your developer account.

After these steps, your device should be in Developer Mode and you should be able to run your provisioned testing build.

Please note that you need to have the latest version of Xcode that supports iOS 16.0, and your Mac and iOS device should be on the same local network.
