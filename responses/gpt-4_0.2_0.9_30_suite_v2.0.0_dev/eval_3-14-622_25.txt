To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol in SwiftUI, you need to create a struct that conforms to `ShapeStyle` and implement the `makeBody` function. Here is how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
    }
    
    func _makeView(geometry: _GraphValue<_ShapeLayout>, inputs: _ViewInputs) -> _ViewOutputs {
        let color = Color.red
        return color._makeView(geometry: geometry, inputs: inputs)
    }
}
```

In the above code, `RedShapeStyle` is a struct that conforms to `ShapeStyle`. It uses `Color.red` to fill the shape.
