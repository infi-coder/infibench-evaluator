The error message you're seeing is due to a change in Android 12 (API level 31) that requires you to specify whether a `PendingIntent` is mutable or immutable when you create it. This is a new requirement in Android 12 and later.

The `MediaSessionCompat` class in the AndroidX Media library creates a `PendingIntent` internally, and it seems like it's not setting the required flag. This is likely a bug in the library.

However, you can work around this issue by setting a Media Button Receiver in your manifest file. This will cause `MediaSessionCompat` to use a different code path that doesn't trigger the issue.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Define a `BroadcastReceiver` in your app that will handle media button events. This can be an empty implementation if you don't actually need to handle these events.

```kotlin
class MediaButtonReceiver : BroadcastReceiver() {
    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
        // Handle media button event here if needed
    }
}
```

2. Register this receiver in your manifest file:

```xml
<receiver android:name=".MediaButtonReceiver">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MEDIA_BUTTON" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

3. When creating your `MediaSessionCompat` instance, set the media button receiver to the one you just defined:

```kotlin
val mediaButtonReceiver = ComponentName(this, MediaButtonReceiver::class.java)
mediaSession = MediaSessionCompat(this, TAG, mediaButtonReceiver, null).apply {
    setCallback(mediaSessionCallback)
    isActive = true
}
```

This should prevent the `IllegalArgumentException` from being thrown. However, please note that this is a workaround and the underlying issue should be fixed in a future version of the AndroidX Media library.
