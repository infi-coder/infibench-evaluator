It seems like you're trying to find a way to retrieve the local path of a file that is synced with OneDrive/SharePoint. Unfortunately, Excel VBA does not provide a direct way to retrieve the local path of a file synced with OneDrive/SharePoint.

However, you can use a workaround by using the `Environ` function in VBA to get the local OneDrive path and then append the relative path of your file. Here's a simple example:

```vba
Sub GetOneDrivePath()

    Dim OneDrivePath As String
    Dim FilePath As String

    ' Get the local OneDrive path
    OneDrivePath = Environ("OneDrive")

    ' Append the relative path of your file
    FilePath = OneDrivePath & "\Path\To\Your\File"

    ' Print the local path
    Debug.Print FilePath

End Sub
```

Please replace `"\Path\To\Your\File"` with the relative path of your file. This method assumes that all users have their OneDrive set up in the default location.

As for creating folders and files on SharePoint using VBA, it's a bit more complex because it involves working with SharePoint's REST API or WebDAV, which might not be feasible or efficient in your case.

If the above method does not work for you, you might want to consider using a different approach to manage your files, such as using a database system that can handle multiple users and maintain data consistency.
