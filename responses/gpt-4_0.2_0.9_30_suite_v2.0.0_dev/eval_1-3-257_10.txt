Here is a Python function that divides an even number into N parts, each part being a multiple of 2:

```python
def divideNumber(num, n):
    # Calculate the base value and the remainder
    base = num // n
    remainder = num % n

    # Ensure base is even
    if base % 2 != 0:
        base -= 1
        remainder += n

    # Distribute the remainder
    result = [base + 2] * (remainder // 2) + [base] * (n - remainder // 2)

    return result
```

This function first calculates the base value and the remainder of the division. If the base value is not even, it decreases the base by 1 and increases the remainder by n. Then it distributes the remainder by adding 2 to each group in succession. The result is a list of n parts, each part being a multiple of 2.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```python
print(divideNumber(100, 3))  # Output: [34, 34, 32]
```

This function assumes that the input number is even and that the number of parts is greater than 0. If these conditions are not met, the function may not work as expected.
