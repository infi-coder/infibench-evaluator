The error is because you are trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`). EF Core does not support this. 

Indexes in Entity Framework Core are used to improve the performance of data retrieval operations in a database. They are most often used with primary and foreign key constraints. Indexes are not used on navigation properties, but rather on the foreign key properties that the navigation properties use.

You should create an index on the `GenderId` property instead of the `Gender` navigation property. Here's how you can do it:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);` creates an index on the `GenderId` column in the `User` table.
