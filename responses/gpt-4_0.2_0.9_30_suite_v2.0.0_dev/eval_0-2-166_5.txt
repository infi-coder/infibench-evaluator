In Tailwind CSS, you don't directly select elements like you do in traditional CSS. Instead, you apply utility classes directly to the elements you want to style in your HTML.

If you want to apply styles to direct children of a `div` with class `section`, you would need to apply the classes directly to those child `div` elements in your HTML.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white"> <!-- Apply your styles here -->
    Child 1
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white"> <!-- And here -->
    Child 2
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-blue-500` applies a blue background and `text-white` applies white text color to the direct children of the `div` with class `section`.

If you need to apply styles to elements based on their parent (like in your example), you might need to use JavaScript or a preprocessor like Sass, or reconsider your HTML structure to better suit the utility-first methodology of Tailwind CSS.
