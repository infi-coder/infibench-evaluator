The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. In Entity Framework, an index can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties. 

In your case, `Gender` is a navigation property in the `User` entity. If you want to create an index, you should create it on the `GenderId` property which is a foreign key, not on the `Gender` navigation property.

Here is the corrected code:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId); // Create index on GenderId, not on Gender
    });
}
```

This will create an index on the `GenderId` column in the `Users` table, which should speed up the queries that filter or sort the users by `GenderId`.
