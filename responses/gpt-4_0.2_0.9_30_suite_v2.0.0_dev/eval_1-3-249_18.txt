Sure, here is a Python function that generates a 16-character code with your requirements:

```python
import random
import string

def generateRandomString():
    # Generate a random string of length 11 without digits
    letters = string.ascii_letters
    random_string = ''.join(random.choice(letters) for i in range(11))

    # Generate a random string of length 3 with digits
    digits = string.digits
    random_digits = ''.join(random.choice(digits) for i in range(3))

    # Combine the strings and shuffle them
    combined_string = list(random_string + random_digits + "NAA3U")
    random.shuffle(combined_string)
    final_string = ''.join(combined_string)

    # Check if the final string contains "NAA3U" and has exactly 3 digits
    if "NAA3U" in final_string and sum(c.isdigit() for c in final_string) == 3:
        return final_string
    else:
        return generateRandomString()

print(generateRandomString())
```

This function generates a random string of length 11 without digits, a random string of length 3 with digits, and combines them with the string "NAA3U". Then it shuffles the combined string.

After shuffling, it checks if the final string contains "NAA3U" and has exactly 3 digits. If it does, it returns the final string. If it doesn't, it calls itself again to generate a new string.

Please note that this function uses recursion, which means it calls itself until it generates a string that meets the requirements. This could potentially lead to a stack overflow if the function is unable to generate a string that meets the requirements after many attempts. However, given the requirements, this is unlikely to happen.
