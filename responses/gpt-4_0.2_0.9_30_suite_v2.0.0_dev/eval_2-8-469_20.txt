The error message is indicating that the `go_package` option is missing in your proto file. This option is used to specify the package name for the generated Go code. You can fix this by adding a `go_package` option to your proto file like this:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "main";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

In this case, the `go_package` is set to "main". You should replace "main" with the actual package name you want to use in your Go code.

After making this change, you should be able to generate the Go code using the same `protoc` command:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. simple.proto
```
