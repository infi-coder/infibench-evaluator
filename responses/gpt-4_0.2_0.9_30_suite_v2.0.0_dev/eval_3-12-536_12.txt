You can use `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton` and `TextButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property. 

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with border-radius in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  child: Text('Button'),
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20), // 20 is the radius value
    ),
  ),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton` is used, but you can replace it with `OutlinedButton` or `TextButton` depending on your needs. The `shape` property is used to define the shape of the button, and `RoundedRectangleBorder` is used to make the button rounded. The `borderRadius` property is used to specify the radius of the border. You can adjust the value according to your needs.
