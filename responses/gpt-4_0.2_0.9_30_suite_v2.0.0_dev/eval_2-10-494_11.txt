The error message "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args`" is coming from the Rust Analyzer, which is a language server protocol implementation for Rust. It's not an error with your code, but rather an issue with the Rust Analyzer itself.

Rust Analyzer sometimes has trouble resolving macros, especially in more complex scenarios. This is a known issue and the Rust Analyzer team is actively working on improving macro support.

In your case, the error is likely due to the use of the `format_args!` macro inside the `assert_eq!` macro in your test function. Rust Analyzer is having trouble resolving the `format_args!` macro, hence the error message.

As for how to fix it, there's not much you can do on your end. You can try updating Rust Analyzer to the latest version, as the team frequently releases updates that improve macro support. If the issue persists, you can report it to the Rust Analyzer team on their GitHub page.

In the meantime, if the error message is bothering you, you can disable macro error highlighting in Rust Analyzer's settings. This won't affect your ability to compile or run your code, as the error is only in the Rust Analyzer and not in the Rust compiler itself.
