The problem with your script is that you're using single quotes around `$searchT` in your `grep` command. Single quotes in bash will prevent variable expansion, so `grep` is literally searching for the string `$searchT` instead of the value of the variable `searchT`.

You should use double quotes instead. Here is the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

This script will ask for a search term, then it will search for this term in the file `test.txt`. If it finds the term, it will print the number of matches and the lines containing the matches. If it doesn't find the term, it will print "no match found".
