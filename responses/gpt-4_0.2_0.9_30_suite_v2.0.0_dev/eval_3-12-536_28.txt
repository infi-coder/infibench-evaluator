You can use `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton`, and `TextButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property. 

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with `border-radius` in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {},
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20), // 20 is the radius value
    ),
  ),
  child: Text('Rounded Button'),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton` is used, but you can also use `OutlinedButton` or `TextButton` in the same way. The `shape` property is placed in the `style` property and you can change it to `RoundedRectangleBorder` and set the `borderRadius` to create a rounded button.
