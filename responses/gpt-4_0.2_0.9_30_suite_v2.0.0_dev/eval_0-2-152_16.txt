You need to call the `toast` method on your toast element to make it show up. You can do this by modifying your JavaScript code as follows:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event, like a button click, you can wrap the above line of code inside an event handler. For example:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function(){
  $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

This will show the toast when a button with the id `myButton` is clicked.

Also, make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JS files in your HTML file. The toast component requires Bootstrap's JavaScript file to function properly.
