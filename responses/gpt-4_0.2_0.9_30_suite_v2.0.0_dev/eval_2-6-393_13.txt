The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. In Entity Framework, indexes can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

The `Gender` property in your `User` class is a navigation property, which is used to establish relations between entities (in this case, between `User` and `Gender`). 

If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property (which is a foreign key), you can do so like this:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);` creates an index on the `GenderId` property.
