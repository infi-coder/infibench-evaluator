The `f` in `print(f"...")` is used to denote a formatted string literal, also known as an f-string. This was introduced in Python 3.6.

F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting. The expressions will be replaced by their values when the string is evaluated.

In your example:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

The `{args.input_directory}` and `{args.output_directory}` inside the f-string are expressions that get evaluated and their results are inserted into the string. 

So if `args.input_directory` is `/home/user/input` and `args.output_directory` is `/home/user/output`, the printed strings will be:

```
Input directory: /home/user/input
Output directory: /home/user/output
```

This is a very handy feature in Python for string formatting.
