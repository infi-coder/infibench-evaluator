The `rename` method is used to rename the columns or index of a DataFrame. However, in your case, you are trying to rename the Series returned by the `mean` method, which is why you are getting an error.

Here's how you can modify your function to rename the column:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg.columns = ["t", "mean"]
    return avg
```

In this function, `groupby` is used to group the DataFrame by the "t" column. The `mean` method is then called on the "p" column to get the average. The `reset_index` method is used to convert the index created by the `groupby` method back into a column. Finally, the `columns` attribute is used to rename the columns.

Here's how you can use this function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assume datafile is a file containing your data
datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])

df = renameDataFrame(df)
```

After running this code, `df` will be a DataFrame with the "t" column and a "mean" column, which contains the mean of the "p" values for each group of "t".
