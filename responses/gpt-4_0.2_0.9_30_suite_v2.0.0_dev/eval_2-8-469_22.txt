The error message is indicating that the `go_package` option is missing in your proto file. This option is used to specify the full Go package path. 

You can fix this by adding `option go_package = "<your-package-path>";` to your proto file. Replace `<your-package-path>` with the actual path of your Go package.

Here's how your proto file should look:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "<your-package-path>";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

After making these changes, you should be able to generate the Go code without any errors.
