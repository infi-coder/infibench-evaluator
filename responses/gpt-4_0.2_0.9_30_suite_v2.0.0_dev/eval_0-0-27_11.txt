Your code seems fine, but there could be several reasons why the loading state is hanging:

1. **Network issues**: Check your network connection. If you are running this on a physical device, make sure it has access to the internet. If you are running this on an emulator, make sure the emulator has internet access.

2. **Server issues**: The server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' might be down or not responding. You can check this by trying to access the server URL in a web browser or using a tool like Postman.

3. **CORS issues**: If your server doesn't allow requests from your client's origin, it might be causing this issue. You can check the server's console or network logs to see if this is the case. If you control the server, you might need to add your client's origin to the server's CORS policy.

4. **Apollo Client version**: There might be a compatibility issue with the version of Apollo Client you are using. Try downgrading or upgrading the version to see if that resolves the issue.

5. **React Native version**: There might be a compatibility issue with the version of React Native you are using. Try downgrading or upgrading the version to see if that resolves the issue.

6. **GraphQL query**: There might be an issue with your GraphQL query. Try running the query in a GraphQL playground to see if it returns the expected data.

If none of these suggestions work, you might want to consider posting a question on a site like Stack Overflow or the Apollo Client GitHub issues page. Provide as much detail as possible, including any error messages you are seeing and the steps you have already tried to resolve the issue.
