Sure, here is a bash script that will install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink current python
brew unlink python

# Install specific version of python
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed python version
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will unlink your current Python installation. If you have any important packages installed, you might need to reinstall them.
