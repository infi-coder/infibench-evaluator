You can use `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton`, and `TextButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property.

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with `border-radius` in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20), // Change this value to change the border radius
    ),
  ),
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  child: Text('Button'),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton.styleFrom` is used to define the style of the button. The `shape` property is set to `RoundedRectangleBorder` with a `borderRadius` of 20. You can change this value to adjust the border radius of the button. The `onPressed` property is where you define what happens when the button is pressed.
