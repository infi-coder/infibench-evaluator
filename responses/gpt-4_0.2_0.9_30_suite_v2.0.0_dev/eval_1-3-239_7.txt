Sure, here is a bash script that will install Python 3.6.5 using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install Python 3.6.5
brew install python@3.6

# Link Python 3.6.5
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that Homebrew does not keep all versions of a formula, so it's not guaranteed that you can install any version you want. The `python@3.6` formula is available at the time of writing, but it may be removed in the future. If the version you want is not available, you may need to use a different method to install it.
