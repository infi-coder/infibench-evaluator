The error message you're seeing is due to a conflict between the Node.js and npm versions installed on your Windows system and those installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu environment. 

The `whereis` command shows that there are two installations of Node.js and npm: one in `/usr/bin/` (the Ubuntu installation) and one in `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/` (the Windows installation). 

When you run `npm -v`, the system is trying to use the Windows version of npm, but it can't interpret the file correctly because it's running in a Linux environment.

To solve this issue, you need to adjust your `PATH` environment variable to prioritize the Ubuntu installation over the Windows one. You can do this by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
```

After adding this line, you need to source the file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

or 

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now, when you run `npm -v`, the system should use the Ubuntu version of npm, and you should not see the error message anymore.
