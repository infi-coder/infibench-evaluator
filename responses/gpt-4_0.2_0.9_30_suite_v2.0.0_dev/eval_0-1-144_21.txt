You can change the color of the accordion arrow by using CSS pseudo-elements. The accordion arrow is created using the `::before` pseudo-element. You can change its color by targeting this pseudo-element and changing its border color.

Here is the CSS code you need to add:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* Bootstrap 4 uses `::after`. Bootstrap 5 uses `::before`. */
    border-color: green !important;
}
```

Please note that the `!important` rule is used to override the default Bootstrap styles. It's generally recommended to avoid using `!important` if possible, but in this case, it's the easiest way to override the Bootstrap styles.

Also, remember to include this CSS after the Bootstrap CSS in your HTML file, so it can override the default Bootstrap styles.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/bootstrap.css">
<style>
    .accordion-button::after {
        border-color: green !important;
    }
</style>
```

If you are using Bootstrap 5, you should use `::before` instead of `::after`:

```css
.accordion-button::before {
    border-color: green !important;
}
```

This should change the color of the accordion arrow to green.
