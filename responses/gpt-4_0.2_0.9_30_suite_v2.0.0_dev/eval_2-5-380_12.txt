The issue you're facing might be due to the change in the URL path for Swagger UI in the newer versions of Springdoc OpenAPI UI. 

In the newer versions, the Swagger UI is not available at `/swagger-ui.html` anymore. Instead, it is available at `/swagger-ui/index.html` or simply `/swagger-ui/`.

So, try accessing Swagger UI at one of these URLs:

- `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`
- `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/`

Also, make sure your application is running on port 8080. If it's running on a different port, you'll need to adjust the URL accordingly. 

If you still face issues, check your Spring Boot application's configuration and ensure that Springdoc OpenAPI UI is properly configured.
