Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. It doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would do in CSS with the `>` operator. 

Tailwind CSS operates by adding utility classes directly to HTML elements. Therefore, you would need to add the necessary classes to the child `div` elements directly.

For example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-red-500"> <!-- Add your Tailwind CSS classes here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

If you need to apply styles conditionally or based on some hierarchy, you might need to use JavaScript to add or remove classes, or consider using a CSS-in-JS solution that works with Tailwind CSS, like `@emotion/css` or `styled-components`.
