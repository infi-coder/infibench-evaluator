The error message indicates that the zlib library, which is a required dependency for Pillow, could not be found on your system. 

However, the Pillow version you are trying to install (6.0.0) does not support Python 3.8, which you are using. This is also mentioned in the error log you posted:

```bash
C:\Users\rijal\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-install-di5is9gd\Pillow\setup.py:29: RuntimeWarning: Pillow does not yet support Python 3.8 and does not yet provide prebuilt Windows binaries. We do not recommend building from source on Windows.
```

You should try installing a newer version of Pillow that supports Python 3.8. You can do this by simply running:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

This command will install the latest version of Pillow.

If you still encounter issues, you might need to install the zlib library on your system. The process to do this varies depending on your operating system. For Windows, you might need to install a precompiled Windows binary for zlib. You can find these binaries on the [zlib website](http://www.zlib.net/). After downloading and installing zlib, you should be able to install Pillow without any issues.
