It seems like you're trying to find a way to get the local path of a file that is synced with OneDrive/SharePoint using Excel VBA. Unfortunately, Excel VBA doesn't have a built-in function to retrieve the local path of a file synced with OneDrive/SharePoint.

However, you can use a workaround to achieve this. You can use the `Environ` function in VBA to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. Here is an example:

```vba
Sub GetOneDrivePath()
    Dim OneDrivePath As String
    OneDrivePath = Environ("OneDrive")
    Debug.Print OneDrivePath
End Sub
```

This will return the path to the root of the OneDrive folder. If you have a specific folder structure inside your OneDrive, you can append it to the `OneDrivePath` variable.

Please note that this solution assumes that all users have their OneDrive set up with the same folder structure.

As for creating folders and files on SharePoint using VBA, it's a bit more complex due to the need to interact with SharePoint's API. You might want to consider using PowerShell or a more powerful language like C# for this task.
