The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vite's dev server is only listening on `localhost` (127.0.0.1) inside the Docker container by default. This means it's not accessible from outside of the Docker container, including from your host machine.

To fix this, you need to configure Vite to listen on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) inside the Docker container. You can do this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, which should make it accessible from outside the Docker container. After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite dev server from your host machine at `localhost:8080`.
