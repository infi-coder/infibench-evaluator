The error you're encountering is due to the fact that AWS Lambda expects a Linux executable, but you're building your Go program on a Windows machine, which produces a Windows executable.

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go program to a Linux executable. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Set the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to `linux` and `amd64` respectively, and then build your Go program. Here's the command:

```bash
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -o main main.go
```

This will create a Linux executable named `main` in your project directory.

4. Zip the `main` executable:

```bash
zip function.zip main
```

5. Upload `function.zip` to AWS Lambda.

Now, your Lambda function should work as expected.
