The problem here is that the package you're trying to install, `aws-sdk-js`, does not exist in the npm registry. The correct package name for the AWS SDK for JavaScript is `aws-sdk`. 

You can install it by running:

```bash
npm install --save aws-sdk
```

The `--save` flag is used to add the package to your `package.json` file's dependencies. If you're using npm 5.0.0 or later, the `--save` flag is not necessary as it's done by default. 

So, the error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` is simply saying that there's no package named `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry. 

Always ensure that you have the correct package name when installing from npm. You can search for packages on the [npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/) if you're unsure about the name.
