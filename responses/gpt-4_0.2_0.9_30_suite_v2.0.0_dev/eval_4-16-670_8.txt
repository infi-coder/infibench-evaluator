Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` tool. Here's how:

1. Convert OpenSSH private key to RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for the passphrase (if any) of the key. After entering the passphrase, it will write the RSA private key out to the same file, `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

The `-p` option tells `ssh-keygen` to change the passphrase of a private key file, `-m PEM` tells it to use the older PEM private key format instead of the new OpenSSH format, and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file to operate on.

2. You do not need to convert the public key. The public key format is standard and does not need to be converted when you convert your private key. The public key can be derived from the private key in either format, so you can continue to use your existing `id_rsa.pub` file without any changes.

Please note that you should backup your keys before performing these operations.
