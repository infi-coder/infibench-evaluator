It seems like you're trying to find a way to retrieve the local path of a file that's synced with OneDrive/SharePoint in Excel VBA. Unfortunately, Excel VBA doesn't have a built-in function to retrieve the local path of a file synced with OneDrive/SharePoint.

However, you could use the `Environ` function in VBA to get the local path of the OneDrive folder, and then append the relative path of your file to it. Here's an example:

```vba
Dim OneDrivePath As String
OneDrivePath = Environ("OneDrive")
```

This will return the local path of the OneDrive folder. You can then append the relative path of your file to `OneDrivePath`.

Please note that this will only work if the file is located in the OneDrive folder and the user has synced their OneDrive folder to their local machine.

As for creating folders and files on SharePoint using VBA, it's a bit more complex due to SharePoint's REST API and authentication. You might want to consider using Power Automate or SharePoint's built-in workflows for these tasks.
