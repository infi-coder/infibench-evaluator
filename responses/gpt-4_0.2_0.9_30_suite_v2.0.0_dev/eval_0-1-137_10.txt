The error message you're seeing is because the `map-loop` function is not a built-in Sass function. It seems like it's a custom function defined somewhere else in your project or in a library you're using.

However, you can modify the Bootstrap theme colors using Sass by overriding the `$theme-colors` map before importing Bootstrap. Here's how you can do it:

```scss
// Import Bootstrap's functions and variables
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

// Override the theme colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #123456, // Replace with your color
  "secondary": #654321, // Replace with your color
  // Add other colors if needed
);

// Import the rest of Bootstrap
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

In this code, replace `#123456` and `#654321` with the colors you want to use for `primary` and `secondary`, respectively. You can add more colors to the `$theme-colors` map if you want to override more theme colors.

This will override the default Bootstrap theme colors with your own colors. When you compile your Sass code, Bootstrap will use your colors instead of the default ones.
