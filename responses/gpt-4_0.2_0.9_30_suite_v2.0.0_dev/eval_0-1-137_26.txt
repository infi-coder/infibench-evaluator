The error message you're seeing is because you're trying to overwrite the `$theme-colors` map after it has already been used in the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file. 

You should define your custom colors before importing the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file. Also, you need to import the Bootstrap's `_functions.scss` file before defining your custom colors because the `$theme-colors` map uses the `map-merge()` function which is defined in the `_functions.scss` file.

Here is how you should structure your SCSS file:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: map-merge($theme-colors, (
  "primary": #your-color-here
));

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Replace `#your-color-here` with the color you want to use for the primary theme color.

This way, you're extending the `$theme-colors` map with your custom colors before it's used in the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file, which should fix the error you're seeing.
