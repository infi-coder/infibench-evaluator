You can use `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton`, and `TextButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property.

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with border-radius in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {},
  child: Text('Button'),
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20), // Change this to your desired radius
    ),
  ),
)
```

In the above code, `ElevatedButton` is the button theme, `shape` is the property that you can change to adjust the shape of the button, and `style` is the property where `shape` is placed. The `RoundedRectangleBorder` widget is used to make the button rounded, and you can adjust the radius by changing the value of `borderRadius`.
