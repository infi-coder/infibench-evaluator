The `f` in `print(f"...")` is used to create what's called an f-string, a feature introduced in Python 3.6. It's a way to format strings in Python.

The `f` stands for "formatted" and it allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`. The expressions will be replaced with their values when the string is created.

In your example:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

The `{args.input_directory}` and `{args.output_directory}` inside the f-string are placeholders for the actual values of `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory`.

So, if `args.input_directory` is `/home/user/input` and `args.output_directory` is `/home/user/output`, the above code will print:

```
Input directory: /home/user/input
Output directory: /home/user/output
```

This is a very convenient way to create strings that include variables or expressions.
