The issue you're facing is due to changes in Android 12 (API level 31) regarding PendingIntent mutability. From Android 12 onwards, you need to explicitly specify whether a PendingIntent is mutable or immutable when you create it.

The error message suggests that the PendingIntent is being created in the `MediaSessionCompat` class, which is part of the AndroidX library. The AndroidX library should handle this issue, but it seems like it's not doing so in your case.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Update your AndroidX libraries**: Make sure all your AndroidX libraries are updated to the latest version. The issue might have been fixed in a newer version.

2. **Use the latest version of the Media library**: You mentioned that you're using version 1.4.0 of the Media library. Make sure this is the latest version available.

3. **Check your PendingIntent creation**: If you're creating PendingIntents in your own code, make sure you're specifying the mutability. Here's how you can do it:

```kotlin
val intent = Intent(this, YourReceiver::class.java)
val pendingIntent: PendingIntent = if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
    PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE or PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT)
} else {
    PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT)
}
```

4. **Check your targetSdkVersion**: Make sure your `targetSdkVersion` in your `build.gradle` file is set to 31 or above.

If none of these steps work, it might be a bug in the AndroidX library. In this case, you should report the issue to the Android issue tracker.
