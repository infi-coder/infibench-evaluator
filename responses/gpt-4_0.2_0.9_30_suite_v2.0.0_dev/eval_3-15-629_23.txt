You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` object to interact with the clipboard. Here's a simple function that copies text to the clipboard:

```vba
Function CopyToClipboard(s As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText s
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
    Set DataObj = Nothing
End Function
```

You can use it like this:

```vba
CopyToClipboard Me.NodeKey.Value
```

This function requires a reference to the Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library. To add this reference:

1. In the VBA editor, go to `Tools > References`.
2. In the References dialog, scroll down to `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library` and check it.
3. Click `OK` to close the dialog.

If you can't find the `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library`, you may need to browse for `FM20.DLL` on your system and add it manually.
