The error you're seeing is because the 'year' column contains float values represented as strings (e.g., '2021.0'). The `int()` function cannot directly convert these to integers, hence the ValueError. 

You can solve this by first converting the strings to floats, and then converting the floats to integers. Here's how you can modify your function:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

This function will first convert the 'year' column to float, and then to int. This will handle the '2021.0' like strings correctly.
