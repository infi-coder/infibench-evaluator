The error message is indicating that the `go_package` option is missing in your proto file. This option is used to specify the full Go package path. It is used as the package import path in the generated Go file.

You can fix the error by adding the `go_package` option to your proto file. Here's how you can do it:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "github.com/yourusername/yourreponame/yourpackage";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

Replace `"github.com/yourusername/yourreponame/yourpackage"` with the actual path to your Go package.

After adding the `go_package` option, you should be able to generate the Go code without any issues.
