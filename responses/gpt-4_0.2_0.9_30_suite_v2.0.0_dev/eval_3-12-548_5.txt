Use `WillPopScope` instead of `Navigator.pop(context)` or `Navigator.of(context).pop()`. 

`WillPopScope` is a widget that detects when the user has pressed the back button on their device and calls a specified function. You can use this to control the behavior of the back button. 

Here is an example of how you can use it to disable the back button:

```dart
return WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () async => false, // disable back button
  child: Scaffold(
    // your widget tree
  ),
);
```

In this case, the `onWillPop` function is set to an asynchronous function that always returns false. This effectively disables the back button.
