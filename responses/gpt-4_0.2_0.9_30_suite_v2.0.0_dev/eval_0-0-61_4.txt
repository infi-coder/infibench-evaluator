You should use the `CssBaseline` component from Material-UI. This component is a simple normalization of CSS, providing low-level utility classes and setting up a default Material-UI theme on your app.

Here's how you can use it:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider, createMuiTheme, CssBaseline } from '@material-ui/core';

const lightTheme = createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    type: 'light',
    // your palette here
  },
});

const darkTheme = createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    type: 'dark',
    // your palette here
  },
});

export default function App() {
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = React.useState(false);

  const theme = darkMode ? darkTheme : lightTheme;

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <CssBaseline />
      {/* your other components */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

In this example, `CssBaseline` will apply the background color for the body element according to the theme. You can switch between the light and dark themes by changing the `darkMode` state.

Remember to place `CssBaseline` as high as possible in your component tree, ideally as a child of your `ThemeProvider`. This ensures that the normalization styles are applied once and low-level utility classes can be overridden by more specific ones.
