The error message `FormatException: Unexpected character (at character 1)` usually indicates that the response from the server is not a valid JSON string. 

Here are a few things you can do to debug and solve this issue:

1. **Print the response body**: Before decoding the response, print it to the console to see what you're actually receiving from the server. This will help you identify if the response is a valid JSON string or not.

```dart
print('Response body: ${response.body}');
```

2. **Check the server-side script**: Make sure that your PHP script is correctly outputting a JSON string. Use `json_encode()` to convert an array or object into a JSON string in PHP. Also, ensure that no characters (like whitespaces or HTML tags) are being output before or after the JSON string.

3. **Check the response status code**: Before decoding the response, check the HTTP status code. If it's not 200, there might be an error on the server-side.

```dart
if (response.statusCode == 200) {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} else {
  print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}.');
}
```

4. **Handle exceptions**: Wrap your JSON decoding in a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that might occur.

```dart
try {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} catch (e) {
  print('Error: $e');
}
```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and solve the issue causing the `FormatException`.
