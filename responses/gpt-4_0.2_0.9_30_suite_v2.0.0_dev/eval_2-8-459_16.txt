The error message you're seeing indicates that Go is unable to find the specific version of the module you're trying to import. This could be due to a number of reasons, but here are a few things you could try:

1. **Check your network connection**: Make sure that you have a stable internet connection and that you're able to access the GitHub repository from your browser.

2. **Check your GitHub credentials**: Make sure that your GitHub credentials are correctly configured on your computer. You can do this by running `git config --global --get user.name` and `git config --global --get user.email` in your terminal. If these commands don't return your GitHub username and email, you'll need to configure them by running `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and `git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"`.

3. **Check your Go version**: Make sure that you're using a version of Go that supports modules. You can do this by running `go version` in your terminal. If you're not using Go 1.11 or later, you'll need to upgrade.

4. **Check your GOPROXY settings**: Go 1.13 and later versions use a module proxy by default, which can cause issues with private repositories. You can disable this by running `go env -w GOPROXY=direct` in your terminal.

5. **Check your GOSUMDB settings**: Go 1.13 and later versions also use a checksum database by default, which can also cause issues with private repositories. You can disable this by running `go env -w GOSUMDB=off` in your terminal.

6. **Check the module's version**: Make sure that the version of the module you're trying to import actually exists. You can do this by visiting the module's GitHub repository and checking the list of tags.

7. **Try to download the module manually**: You can try to download the module manually by running `go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5` in your terminal. If this command fails, it should give you a more detailed error message.

8. **Check your go.mod and go.sum files**: Make sure that your go.mod and go.sum files are correctly formatted and don't contain any errors. You can do this by running `go mod tidy` in your terminal. This command will automatically fix any errors in your go
