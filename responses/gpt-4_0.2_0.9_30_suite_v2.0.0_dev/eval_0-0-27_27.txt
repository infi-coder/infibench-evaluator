Your code seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you can check if the data loading hangs:

1. **Network Connection:** Ensure that your device/emulator has a proper network connection. Sometimes, the network might be the issue.

2. **Server Status:** Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can do this by simply pasting the URL into your web browser and seeing if it loads correctly.

3. **Apollo Client Version:** There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to an older version to see if that resolves the issue.

4. **Error Handling:** You might be having an error but it's not being displayed correctly. Try logging the error object to see if it contains any useful information:

    ```javascript
    if (error) {
        console.error(error);
        return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
    }
    ```

5. **GraphQL Query:** Ensure that your GraphQL query is correct and the server supports it. You can test the query directly on the GraphQL server if it has a playground.

6. **React Native Debugger:** If you're using React Native Debugger, there might be an issue with the network inspect. Try disabling it and see if the problem persists.

If none of these work, you might want to create a minimal reproduction of the issue and ask for help in the Apollo Client GitHub repository or StackOverflow.
