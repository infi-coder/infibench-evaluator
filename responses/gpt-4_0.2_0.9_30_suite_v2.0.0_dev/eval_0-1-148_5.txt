Sure, you can use the `last:` variant provided by Tailwind CSS to target the last element in a list. Here's how you can modify your code:

```html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="(item, index) in items"
    :key="`item-${index}`"
    class="border-solid border-b border-black last:border-b-0"
  >
    Item
  </li>
</ul>
```

In this code, `last:border-b-0` is used to remove the bottom border from the last `<li>` element. This is a Tailwind CSS feature that applies the `border-b-0` class to the last child of its parent container. 

Please note that by default, variants like `last` are not enabled in Tailwind CSS. You will need to enable it in your `tailwind.config.js` file like so:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  variants: {
    extend: {
      borderWidth: ['last'],
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

This will enable the `last` variant for `borderWidth` utilities. After making this change, you'll need to rebuild your CSS.
