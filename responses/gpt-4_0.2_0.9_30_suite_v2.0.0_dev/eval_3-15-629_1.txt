You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. First, you need to add a reference to "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library" in VBA (Go to Tools -> References -> and check "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library").

Here is a simple function to copy text to the clipboard:

```vba
Public Sub CopyToClipboard(s As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText s
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
End Sub
```

You can use this function to copy the node path value to the clipboard:

```vba
Call CopyToClipboard(Me.NodeKey.Value)
```

This will copy the value of `Me.NodeKey.Value` to the clipboard.
