The error message you're seeing is due to a conflict between the Windows and WSL versions of Node.js and npm. The WSL environment is trying to execute the Windows version of npm, which is not compatible with the Linux environment.

To solve this issue, you need to remove the Windows path from the WSL environment. You can do this by editing the `.bashrc` file in your home directory.

Here are the steps:

1. Open the `.bashrc` file in your favorite text editor. If you're using nano, you can do this by typing:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"
```

3. Save and close the file. If you're using nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

4. Update your system's environment variables with the new PATH by typing:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

5. Now, you should be able to use npm without any issues. You can check this by typing:

```bash
npm -v
```

This should display the version of npm installed on your system.

If you still encounter issues, you might need to reinstall Node.js and npm in your WSL environment. You can do this by typing:

```bash
sudo apt-get purge nodejs npm
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

This will remove the existing Node.js and npm, then install the latest LTS version of Node.js and npm.
