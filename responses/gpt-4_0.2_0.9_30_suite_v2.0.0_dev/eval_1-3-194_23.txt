You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write data into an Excel file. Here is the function `writeToExcel`:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = Workbook()  # Create a new workbook
    ws = wb.active  # Get the active worksheet

    # Write data into the worksheet
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
            ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

    # Save the workbook as an Excel file
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new Excel file named "data.xlsx" and writes the contents of `new_list` into the file. Each sublist in `new_list` corresponds to a row in the Excel file. Note that the row and column indices in `openpyxl` start from 1, not 0.

You need to install `openpyxl` if it's not already installed. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install openpyxl
```
