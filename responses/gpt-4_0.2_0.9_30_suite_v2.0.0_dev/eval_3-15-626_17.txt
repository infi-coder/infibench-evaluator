Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues. 

First, you're trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as if they were objects, but you're assigning them string values. 

Second, you're trying to use `query.Name` but `query` is a string, not an object, so it doesn't have a `Name` property.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As String

    ' Get the query from the cell A1 in Sheet6
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value 

    ' Get the name of the active sheet
    currentSheet = ActiveSheet.Name

    ' Create a new ListObject with a QueryTable that uses the Power Query
    With ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With
     
End Sub
```

This code will create a new QueryTable in the "target" sheet that uses the Power Query from the cell A1 in Sheet6. The QueryTable will refresh immediately and will not refresh automatically when the file is opened.
