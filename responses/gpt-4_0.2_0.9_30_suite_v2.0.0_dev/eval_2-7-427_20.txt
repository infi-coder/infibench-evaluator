The error message you're seeing is related to the SSL/TLS version that's being used to establish the connection with the SMTP server. The error message `ssl3_get_record:wrong version number` indicates that the client (your Laravel application) and the server (mail.propnex.sg) couldn't agree on a protocol version to use for the secure connection.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Change the MAIL_ENCRYPTION setting**: The error message suggests that there might be an issue with the SSL version. Try changing the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` setting in your .env file from `ssl` to `tls`. 

```markdown
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
```

2. **Check the port number**: The standard port for SMTP over SSL is 465, and the standard port for SMTP with STARTTLS is 587. If you're using SSL, you might need to change the `MAIL_PORT` setting in your .env file to 465.

```markdown
MAIL_PORT=465
```

3. **Contact the email server administrator**: If you're still having trouble, it might be worth reaching out to the administrator of the mail.propnex.sg server. They might be able to provide you with the correct settings to use, or they might need to update the server's configuration to support connections from your application.

Remember to clear the config cache after making changes to the .env file. You can do this by running the following command in your Laravel project:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
```

If none of these solutions work, it might be a good idea to use a mail service like Mailgun, Sendgrid, or AWS SES. These services are designed to handle the complexities of sending email, and they provide clear instructions on how to configure your application to use their SMTP servers.
