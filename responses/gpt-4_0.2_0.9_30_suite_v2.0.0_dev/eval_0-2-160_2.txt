Source maps are files that associate the compiled JavaScript that runs in the browser back to the original TypeScript source code. They are used for debugging purposes. 

When `"sourceMap": true` is set in your `tsconfig.json`, the TypeScript compiler generates corresponding `.map` files for each compiled `.js` file. These `.map` files are source map files. 

When you debug your Angular application in a browser, the browser uses these source map files to display the original TypeScript code, which is much easier to read and debug than the compiled JavaScript code.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the TypeScript compiler will not generate these `.map` files. As a result, if you debug your application in a browser, you will see the compiled JavaScript code, not the original TypeScript code. 

However, this change will not affect the behavior of your Angular application. It only affects the debugging experience. 

In a production environment, it's common to set `"sourceMap": false` to reduce the size of the deployment and to hide the source code from the users.
