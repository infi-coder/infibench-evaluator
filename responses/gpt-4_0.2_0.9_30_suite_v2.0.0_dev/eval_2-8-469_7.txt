The error message is indicating that `protoc-gen-go` is unable to determine the Go import path for your `simple.proto` file. This can be fixed by specifying a `go_package` option in your `.proto` source file.

Here's how you can modify your `simple.proto` file:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "github.com/yourusername/yourrepository"; // replace with your package's import path

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

In the `go_package` option, replace `"github.com/yourusername/yourrepository"` with the actual import path of your Go package. This path is typically the repository location where your Go code lives.

After making this change, you should be able to generate Go code from your `.proto` file without any issues.
