To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement the `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType)` method. However, this method is not intended for direct use in your code. 

Instead, you can create a struct that conforms to `ShapeStyle` and use `Color` to define the style. Here is how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        Color.red._apply(to: &shape)
    }
}
```

Please note that `_ShapeStyle_ShapeType` and `_apply(to:)` are underscored because they are part of SwiftUI's internal API and not intended for direct use. They may not work as expected and may change in future versions of SwiftUI. 

In your case, it's better to use `Color.red` directly or create a custom `View` that returns `Color.red`.
