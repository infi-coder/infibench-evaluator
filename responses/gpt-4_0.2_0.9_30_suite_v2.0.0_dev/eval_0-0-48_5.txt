Sure, you can use the `&` operator to combine the two mapped types. Here is the corrected TypeScript code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a new type `FruitsAndColors` that has a numeric property for each fruit and a boolean property for each color.
