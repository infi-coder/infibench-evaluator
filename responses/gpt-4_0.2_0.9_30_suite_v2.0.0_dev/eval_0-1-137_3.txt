The error you're getting is because you're trying to import the Bootstrap variables file before you declare your own custom variables. In SASS, the last declaration of a variable is the one that is used. So, you should declare your custom variables before importing the Bootstrap files.

Also, you're trying to overwrite the `$theme-colors` map entirely. If you want to change only the `primary` color and keep the rest of the colors as they are, you should use the `map-merge` function.

Here's how you can do it:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: map-merge($theme-colors, (
  "primary": #your-color-here
));

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Replace `#your-color-here` with the color you want to use for the `primary` color.

This code first imports the Bootstrap functions and variables, then it changes the `primary` color in the `$theme-colors` map, and finally it imports the rest of the Bootstrap files. This way, when the Bootstrap files are imported, the `primary` color has already been changed to your custom color.

If you want to change multiple colors, you can do it like this:

```scss
$theme-colors: map-merge($theme-colors, (
  "primary": #your-primary-color,
  "secondary": #your-secondary-color,
  // add more colors here if needed
));
```

Just replace `#your-primary-color` and `#your-secondary-color` with the colors you want to use.
