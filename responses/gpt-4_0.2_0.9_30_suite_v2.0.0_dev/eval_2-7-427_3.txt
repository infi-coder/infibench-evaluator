For the CSRF token mismatch error, it could be due to a variety of reasons. Here are some things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the public directory of your Laravel application. Misconfiguration can lead to CSRF token mismatch errors.

2. **Session Configuration**: Check your session configuration in `config/session.php`. Ensure that the `domain` and `path` options are correctly set. If your application is served from a subdirectory, the `path` option should be set to that subdirectory.

3. **HTTPS**: If your application is served over HTTPS, ensure that the `secure` option in `config/session.php` is set to `true`.

4. **Cookies**: Ensure that cookies are enabled in your browser and not being blocked by any browser extensions.

5. **Cache**: Clear your application cache using `php artisan cache:clear` and `php artisan config:clear`.

For the email sending issue, the error message indicates that there's a problem with the SSL configuration. Here are some things you could try:

1. **Encryption Method**: Try changing `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` from `ssl` to `tls` in your `.env` file. Some servers require `tls` instead of `ssl`.

2. **Port Number**: The port number `587` is typically used with `tls`. If you're using `ssl`, the port number should be `465`. So, you might want to try changing `MAIL_PORT` to `465` in your `.env` file.

3. **Server Configuration**: Check with your client if there are any specific configuration requirements for their SMTP server. They might require specific SSL versions or ciphers.

4. **Firewall**: Ensure that your server's firewall is not blocking connections to the SMTP server.

Remember to run `php artisan config:cache` after making changes to your `.env` file to clear the configuration cache.
