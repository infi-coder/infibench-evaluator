The issue you're facing might be due to the fact that the URL for Swagger UI has been updated in recent versions of the Springdoc OpenAPI UI library. 

In the latest versions, the Swagger UI is not available at `/swagger-ui.html` anymore. Instead, it is available at `/swagger-ui/index.html` or `/swagger-ui/`.

So, try accessing the Swagger UI using the following URLs:

- `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/`
- `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`

Also, make sure that your Spring Boot application is running on port 8080. If it's running on a different port, you'll need to adjust the URL accordingly.
