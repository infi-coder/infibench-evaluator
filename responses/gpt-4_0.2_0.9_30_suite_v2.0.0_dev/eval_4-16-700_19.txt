You can optimize your task by using `awk` which is a powerful text processing tool. Here is a more efficient way to solve your problem:

```bash
awk -F'=' '/^name/ {name=$2} /^value/ {print name"="$2}' input.txt > output.txt
```

This `awk` command does the following:

- `-F'='` sets the field separator to `=`.
- `/^name/ {name=$2}` saves the value of the `name` line in the `name` variable.
- `/^value/ {print name"="$2}` prints the `name` and `value` when a `value` line is encountered.

This command will process your file line by line without loading the whole file into memory, which should be much faster and more efficient than your original script.
