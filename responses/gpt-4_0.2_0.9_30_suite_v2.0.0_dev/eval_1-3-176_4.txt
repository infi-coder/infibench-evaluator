The error message indicates that the zlib library, which is a required dependency for Pillow, could not be found. 

However, the Pillow version you are trying to install (6.0.0) does not support Python 3.8 as mentioned in the warning message. 

You should try to install a more recent version of Pillow that supports Python 3.8. 

You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install Pillow --upgrade
```

This command will install the latest version of Pillow. If you still encounter issues, you might want to consider using a Python version that is fully supported by Pillow. 

If you are using a virtual environment, make sure to activate it before running the command. 

If the problem persists, you might need to install the zlib development files. The process to do this varies depending on your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
```

After installing zlib, try installing Pillow again.
