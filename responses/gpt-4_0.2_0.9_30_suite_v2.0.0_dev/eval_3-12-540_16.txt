Yes, in Flutter, you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here is an example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line is drawn between two text components. The `VerticalDivider` widget has properties to customize the color, thickness, and width of the line. 

Please note that the `VerticalDivider` widget is only visible when used in a `Row` or `Flex` widget. It's not visible when used in a `Column` widget because it's a vertical line.
