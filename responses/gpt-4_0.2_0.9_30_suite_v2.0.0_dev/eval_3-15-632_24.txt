Assuming that your data is separated by a specific character (like a comma, space, or tab), you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the string into an array and then assign the array elements to the cells. 

Here is how you can modify your code:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim arr() As String
    arr = Split(textline, " ") ' replace " " with your delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = arr(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = arr(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = arr(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = arr(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = arr(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

Replace `" "` in `Split(textline, " ")` with the character that separates your data. If your data is separated by a tab, use `vbTab` instead. If it's a comma, use `","`.

This code assumes that there are exactly 5 items on the line. If the number of items can vary, you'll need to add some error checking to prevent a "Subscript out of range" error.
