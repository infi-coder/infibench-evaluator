The error you're getting is because you're trying to import the Bootstrap variables file before you declare your custom `$theme-colors` map. The variables file already contains a `$theme-colors` map, and when you try to declare it again, it's causing a conflict.

To fix this, you need to declare your custom `$theme-colors` map before importing the Bootstrap SCSS files. Here is how you can do it:

```scss
// Define your custom colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color, // replace #your-color with your desired color
  "secondary": #6c757d,
  "success": #198754,
  "info": #0dcaf0,
  "warning": #ffc107,
  "danger": #dc3545,
  "light": #f8f9fa,
  "dark": #212529
);

// Then import Bootstrap's main SCSS file
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

In this code, you're defining your custom `$theme-colors` map first, and then importing Bootstrap's main SCSS file. This way, your custom colors will be used instead of the default ones.

Also, make sure you replace `#your-color` with the actual color you want to use for the "primary" color.
