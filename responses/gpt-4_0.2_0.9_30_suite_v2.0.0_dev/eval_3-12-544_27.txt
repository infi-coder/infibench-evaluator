This error is due to the fact that you're trying to use Flutter's engine before it's fully initialized. The `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` function relies on Flutter's engine to communicate with the platform and get the directory path. 

To fix this, you need to ensure that your `main()` function is running inside `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`. This function ensures that Flutter's engine is ready before you start using it.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This should solve your problem.
