The error you're experiencing might be due to a few reasons. Here are some suggestions to troubleshoot:

1. **Check SeleniumBasic and Browser Driver Version:** Ensure that you have the correct version of SeleniumBasic for your Excel version. Also, make sure that the browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome, GeckoDriver for Firefox) is compatible with the browser version you're using.

2. **Check References:** In VBA, go to `Tools > References` and make sure that Selenium Type Library is checked. If it's not, scroll down the list, find it, and check it.

3. **Update Internet Explorer:** Since you're using Internet Explorer in your code (`driver.Start "ie"`), make sure that Internet Explorer is updated to the latest version. Selenium might have issues with older versions of IE.

4. **Change the Browser:** Try changing the browser to Chrome or Firefox to see if the problem persists. For example, you can replace `driver.Start "ie"` with `driver.Start "chrome"` or `driver.Start "firefox"`.

5. **Reinstall SeleniumBasic:** Uninstall SeleniumBasic, restart your computer, and then reinstall SeleniumBasic. This can help if there are any issues with the installation.

6. **Check Excel Trust Center Settings:** In Excel, go to `File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Macro Settings` and ensure that `Trust access to the VBA project object model` is checked.
