There could be a few reasons why you're unable to start a Jupyter notebook in VS Code. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Check your Python interpreter:** Make sure you're using the correct Python interpreter. You can select the interpreter by clicking on the Python version in the bottom-left of the status bar, or by using the `Python: Select Interpreter` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

2. **Check your Jupyter server:** Try starting a Jupyter server manually from the command line to see if there are any issues. You can do this by activating your conda environment and running `jupyter notebook`.

3. **Check your Python and Jupyter installations:** Make sure you have Python and Jupyter installed in your conda environment. You can check this by activating your conda environment and running `python --version` and `jupyter --version`.

4. **Reinstall the Python extension:** Try uninstalling and reinstalling the Python extension in VS Code.

5. **Check your VS Code settings:** Make sure your VS Code settings are correct. You can check your settings by going to `File > Preferences > Settings` (or `Code > Preferences > Settings` on macOS). Look for the `Python Data Science` settings and make sure the `Jupyter Server URI` is set to `Default`.

6. **Check your conda environment:** Make sure your conda environment is set up correctly. You can check this by running `conda info --envs` to see a list of all your conda environments. Make sure the 'da38' environment is listed and has the correct Python version.

If none of these steps solve your issue, please provide more information about your setup (e.g., Python version, Jupyter version, VS Code version, etc.) so we can help you troubleshoot further.
