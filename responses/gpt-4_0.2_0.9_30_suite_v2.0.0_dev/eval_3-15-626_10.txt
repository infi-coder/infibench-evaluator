Your code is almost correct, but there are a few issues:

1. You're trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as `WorkbookQuery` and `Worksheet` objects, but you're actually assigning them string values. You need to declare and set these objects properly.
2. The `query` object should be a `WorkbookQuery` object, which represents a Power Query. You can't just set it to a cell value. You need to create a Power Query in your workbook and then use its name to get the `WorkbookQuery` object.
3. The `currentSheet` object should be a `Worksheet` object. You can get it using `ActiveSheet`.

Here's how you can fix your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As WorkbookQuery
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet
    
    ' Set the currentSheet object to the active sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet
    
    ' Set the query object to the Power Query in your workbook
    ' Replace "YourQueryName" with the name of your Power Query
    Set query = ThisWorkbook.Queries("YourQueryName")
    
    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query.Name _
        , Destination:=Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query.Name & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With
     
End Sub
```

This code assumes that you have a Power Query named "YourQueryName" in your workbook. Replace "YourQueryName" with the actual name of your Power Query.
