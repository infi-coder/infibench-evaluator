You can disable the ordering of includes in `clang-format` by setting the `SortIncludes` option to `false` in your `.clang-format` or `_clang-format` file.

Here is an example of how to do this:

```yaml
---
Language:        Cpp
# BasedOnStyle:  Google
SortIncludes:    false
...
```

This will prevent `clang-format` from sorting your `#include` directives.
