Use `WillPopScope` instead of `Navigator.pop(context)` or `Navigator.of(context).pop()`. 

`WillPopScope` is a widget that detects when the user has pressed the back button on their device. It has a property called `onWillPop` which is a callback function that will be called when the user has pressed the back button. 

Here's an example of how to use it:

```dart
return WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () async => false, // this will disable the back button
  child: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('Login Page'),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: Text('Login Page'),
    ),
  ),
);
```

In this example, the `onWillPop` function is set to an asynchronous function that always returns false. This means that when the user presses the back button, the function will be called and since it returns false, the app will not pop the current route (i.e., it will not go back).
