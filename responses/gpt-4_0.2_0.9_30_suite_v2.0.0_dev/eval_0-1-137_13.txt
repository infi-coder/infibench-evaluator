The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that the `map-loop` function is not a built-in Sass function, and it's not defined anywhere in your code or in Bootstrap's code. 

The `$theme-colors` map should be defined before importing Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` and `_bootstrap.scss` files. Also, you should not import the `_variables.scss` file directly because it's already imported in `_bootstrap.scss`.

Here's how you can modify your SCSS file:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color, // replace #your-color with your desired color
  // you can add more colors here
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

This will override the default primary color with your own color. 

Please replace `#your-color` with the color you want to use. You can also add more colors to the `$theme-colors` map if you want to override more default colors. 

If you're still having issues, please make sure you're using Dart Sass instead of Node Sass, as Bootstrap 5 requires Dart Sass. You can install it with npm:

```bash
npm install sass
```

Then you can compile your SCSS file with the following command:

```bash
npx sass your-file.scss output.css
```

Replace `your-file.scss` with the path to your SCSS file and `output.css` with the path where you want the compiled CSS file to be saved.
