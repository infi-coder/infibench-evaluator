The issue you're facing is due to the fact that `pdftk` is not supported on macOS Catalina and later versions. This is because Catalina only supports 64-bit applications and `pdftk` is a 32-bit application.

However, you can use `pdftk-java` as an alternative. It's a rewrite of `pdftk` in Java, which should work on your Mac.

Here are the steps to install `pdftk-java`:

1. First, you need to install Homebrew if you haven't done so already. Open Terminal and run the following command:

```markdown
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install `pdftk-java` by running:

```markdown
brew install pdftk-java
```

3. After the installation, you need to create a symbolic link to use `pdftk` command instead of `pdftk-java`. Run the following command:

```markdown
echo 'alias pdftk="/usr/local/bin/pdftk-java"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

4. Then, source your `.zshrc` file to apply the changes:

```markdown
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, you should be able to use `pdftk` command as usual.
