The error message `fork/exec /var/task/main: no such file or directory` is indicating that AWS Lambda is not able to find the binary file to execute. This is likely because the binary was built on a Windows machine and is not compatible with the Linux environment that AWS Lambda functions run in.

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code for Linux environment. Here is how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing your Go code.
2. Set the environment variables for cross-compilation:

    ```bash
    set GOOS=linux
    set GOARCH=amd64
    ```

3. Build your Go code:

    ```bash
    go build -o main main.go
    ```

4. Zip the binary:

    ```bash
    zip deployment.zip main
    ```

5. Now, you can upload `deployment.zip` to AWS Lambda.

Please note that the `-o main` flag in the `go build` command specifies the output file name. This is important because AWS Lambda looks for a file named `main` to execute.

Also, the `set` command is used to set environment variables on Windows. If you're using a Unix-based system like Linux or MacOS, you would use the `export` command instead:

```bash
export GOOS=linux
export GOARCH=amd64
```
