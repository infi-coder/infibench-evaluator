- Pressable and TouchableOpacity have the same basic functionalities. They both are for making a text/image touchable or clickable.

- Pressable has some new props, like `hitSlop`, `pressRetentionOffset`, `android_disableSound`, `android_ripple`, and `onLongPress` which you can use to define how far a touch can register away from the the wrapped element.

- On the other hand, TouchableOpacity also have some unique functionalities. For example, TouchableOpacity has automatic opacity handling, where with Pressable you need to add your own custom opacity handling with Pressable's `style` prop. Furthermore, TouchableOpacity adds the opacity animation on press.
