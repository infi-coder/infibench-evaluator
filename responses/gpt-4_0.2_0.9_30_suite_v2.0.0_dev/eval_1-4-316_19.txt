You can sort a list of characters in R using the `sort()` function. However, the `sort()` function in R doesn't work directly on lists. It works on vectors. So, you need to convert your list back to a vector, sort it, and then convert it back to a list if necessary.

Here is the function `mySort`:

```r
mySort <- function(l) {
  # Convert list to vector
  vec <- unlist(l)
  
  # Sort the vector
  sorted_vec <- sort(vec)
  
  # Convert sorted vector back to list
  sorted_list <- as.list(sorted_vec)
  
  return(sorted_list)
}
```

You can use this function to sort your list as follows:

```r
sorted_list_text_data <- mySort(list_text_data)
```

This will give you a sorted list of characters.
