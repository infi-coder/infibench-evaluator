To show the toast, you need to call the `toast` method with the `show` argument on the toast element. Here's how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will make the toast visible on the page. 

Remember to include the necessary Bootstrap JS and CSS files in your HTML file. Also, make sure that you've included jQuery before Bootstrap's JavaScript, as Bootstrap's JavaScript depends on jQuery.

Here's an example of how you can include these files from a CDN:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- JS, Popper.js, and jQuery -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Please replace the version numbers with the ones you are using.
