For the CSRF token mismatch issue, it's possible that the issue is related to the domain or subdomain configuration. Laravel uses cookies to manage sessions and CSRF tokens, and cookies are domain and protocol specific. If your application is hosted under a different domain or subdomain, or if you're accessing it via a different protocol (http vs https), the cookies might not be sent correctly, causing the CSRF token mismatch.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. Make sure your `APP_URL` in your `.env` file matches the domain you're using to access the application.
2. If you're using a subdomain, you might need to configure Laravel to make the session cookie available to all your subdomains. You can do this by setting the `SESSION_DOMAIN` in your `.env` file to your root domain (e.g., `.yourdomain.com`).
3. If you're using HTTPS in production but not in local development, make sure the `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE` is set to `true` in your `.env` file.

For the email sending issue, the error message suggests that there's a problem with the SSL configuration. The `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` setting in your `.env` file is set to `ssl`, but the error message suggests that the server might not support SSL, or it might be expecting a different version.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Change the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` setting to `tls` and see if that works.
2. If that doesn't work, try setting `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` to `null` to disable encryption entirely. Note that this is less secure and should only be used for testing or if the server doesn't support SSL/TLS at all.
3. If neither of these work, you might need to contact the email server administrator or the hosting provider for help. They might be able to provide the correct settings or help troubleshoot the issue.
