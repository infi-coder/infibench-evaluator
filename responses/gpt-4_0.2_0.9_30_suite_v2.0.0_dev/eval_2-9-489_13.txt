The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. Without these security features, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here are the steps:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file (`elasticsearch.yml`) in a text editor. The location of this file depends on how you installed Elasticsearch. If you used Homebrew to install Elasticsearch, the file is likely located at `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`.

2. Add the following lines to the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save and close the `elasticsearch.yml` file.

4. Restart Elasticsearch. If you installed Elasticsearch with Homebrew, you can restart it with the following command:

    ```bash
    brew services restart elasticsearch
    ```

After following these steps, the warning message should no longer appear.

However, enabling security will require you to set up users and roles, and to authenticate to Elasticsearch. If you're running Elasticsearch for development or testing on a secure network, you might decide that you don't need to enable security. In that case, you can ignore the warning.

Please note that these steps are for a basic minimal setup. For a production environment, you should follow the [full setup guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/configuring-security.html) provided by Elasticsearch.
