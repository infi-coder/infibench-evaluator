The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vite's server is listening on `localhost` (127.0.0.1) inside the Docker container. This means it's not accessible from outside the container, even though the port is exposed.

To fix this, you need to configure Vite to listen on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0). You can do this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, making the server accessible from outside the Docker container.
