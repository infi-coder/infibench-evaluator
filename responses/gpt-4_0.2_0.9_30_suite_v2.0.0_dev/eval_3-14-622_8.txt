To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement a method that returns a `Shader`. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedStyle())
    }
}

struct RedStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        // Implement this method
    }
    
    func _makeView(geometry: _GraphValue<_ShapeStyle_ShapeType>, inputs: _ViewInputs) -> _ViewOutputs {
        // Implement this method
    }
}
```

However, the methods `_apply(to:)` and `_makeView(geometry:inputs:)` are underscored, which means they are private to SwiftUI and not meant to be used directly. 

The `ShapeStyle` protocol is not really designed to be conformed to by developers. Instead, you should use one of the provided types that conform to `ShapeStyle`, such as `Color`, `Gradient`, `AngularGradient`, or `RadialGradient`.

If you want to create a custom fill, you should create a custom `View` that draws itself using SwiftUI's drawing primitives, not by trying to conform to `ShapeStyle`.
