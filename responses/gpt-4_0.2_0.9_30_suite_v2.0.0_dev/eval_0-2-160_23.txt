Source maps are files that associate the compiled JavaScript that runs in the browser with the original TypeScript source code. They are used for debugging purposes.

When `"sourceMap": true` is set in your `tsconfig.json`, the TypeScript compiler generates corresponding `.map` files for each compiled `.js` file. These `.map` files are source map files. They help debuggers map the JavaScript code that is actually being executed by the browser back to the original TypeScript source code.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the TypeScript compiler will not generate these `.map` files. This means that if you try to debug your application, the debugger will show the JavaScript code, not the original TypeScript code. This can make debugging more difficult if you're not familiar with the JavaScript that the TypeScript compiler generates.

However, in a production environment, you might want to set `"sourceMap": false` to reduce the size of the deployed code, as the `.map` files can be quite large and are not needed for running the application.

So, in summary, setting `"sourceMap": false` won't change anything in your running app, but it will affect your ability to debug the TypeScript source code.
