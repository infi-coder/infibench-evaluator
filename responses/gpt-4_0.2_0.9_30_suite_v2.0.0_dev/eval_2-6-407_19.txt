The error message you're seeing indicates that the response from your API call is not valid JSON. The '<' character is likely the start of an HTML response, possibly an error page.

First, ensure that your API is correctly configured and returning the expected JSON data. You can test this by navigating directly to the API URL in your web browser or using a tool like Postman.

Second, the route configuration in your API controller seems to be incorrect. You've specified the route at the controller level as `"[controller]"` and then again at the action level as `"api/Employee/Index"`. This would result in a final route of `"Employee/api/Employee/Index"` which is likely not what you want.

Try changing your controller to this:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class EmployeeController : ControllerBase
{
    EmployeeRepository objemployee = new EmployeeRepository();

    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Employee> Index()
    {
        return objemployee.GetAllEmployees();
    }
}
```

This will make your API endpoint available at `/api/Employee`.

Then, in your Blazor app, you can call the API like this:

```csharp
empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("api/Employee");
```

This should correctly call your API and parse the response as JSON. If you're still having issues, I would recommend debugging your API to ensure it's returning the expected data.
