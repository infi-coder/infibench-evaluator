For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the public directory of your Laravel application. Incorrect domain configuration could lead to issues with session management.

2. **Session Domain**: In your `config/session.php` file, check the value of the 'domain' key. If it's set to null, Laravel will use the server's domain. If your application is on a subdomain, you need to set the 'domain' key to your root domain. For example, if your application is hosted on `sub.domain.com`, set 'domain' to `.domain.com`.

3. **Cookie Settings**: Check your cookie settings in `config/session.php`. Ensure that the 'secure' option is set to true if you are using HTTPS, and false if you are using HTTP. Also, check the 'same_site' option. If it's set to 'strict', try changing it to 'lax' or 'none'.

For the second issue, the error message suggests that there is a problem with the SSL connection to the SMTP server. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Change MAIL_ENCRYPTION**: Try changing `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` from `ssl` to `tls` in your `.env` file. Some servers use `tls` instead of `ssl`.

2. **Check MAIL_PORT**: The port you are using (587) is typically used with `tls`. If you are using `ssl`, the port should be 465. If changing `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` to `tls` doesn't work, try changing `MAIL_PORT` to 465 and `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` back to `ssl`.

3. **Contact the Email Provider**: If none of the above solutions work, you should contact the email provider (propnex.sg). They might have specific settings or requirements for connecting to their SMTP server.

Remember to clear the config cache (`php artisan config:cache`) after making changes to your `.env` file or config files.
