The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -v
```

If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you need to upgrade it. The process of upgrading PHP depends on your operating system and its version.

Laravel 9 also requires the following PHP extensions:

- BCMath PHP Extension
- Ctype PHP Extension
- Fileinfo PHP extension
- JSON PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension

You can check the installed extensions by running:

```bash
php -m
```

If any of the required extensions are missing, you need to install them. The process of installing PHP extensions depends on your operating system.

Finally, Laravel 9 requires Composer version 2.0.13 or higher. You can check your Composer version by running:

```bash
composer --version
```

If your Composer version is lower than 2.0.13, you can update it by running:

```bash
composer self-update
```

Once you've made sure that your PHP version, PHP extensions, and Composer version meet the requirements, you should be able to install Laravel 9 without any issues.
