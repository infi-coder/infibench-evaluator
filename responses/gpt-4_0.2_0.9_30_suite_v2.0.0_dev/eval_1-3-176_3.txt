The error message indicates that the Pillow library could not be installed because it couldn't find the headers or library files for zlib, which is a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source.

However, the Pillow version you're trying to install (6.0.0) does not support Python 3.8, which is the Python version you're using. This is mentioned in the error message:

```bash
C:\Users\rijal\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-install-di5is9gd\Pillow\setup.py:29: RuntimeWarning: Pillow does not yet support Python 3.8 and does not yet provide prebuilt Windows binaries. We do not recommend building from source on Windows.
```

To solve this issue, you can try installing a more recent version of Pillow that supports Python 3.8. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pillow --upgrade
```

This command will upgrade Pillow to the latest version available. If you still encounter issues, it might be because you're missing the zlib development files. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
```

Please note that this command is for Debian-based Linux distributions. If you're using a different operating system, the command might be different.

If you're on Windows, you might need to install a precompiled binary. You can find these on the [Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pillow) page. Download the appropriate .whl file for your Python version and architecture, then install it using pip:

```bash
pip install /path/to/downloaded/file.whl
```

Replace `/path/to/downloaded/file.whl` with the actual path where you downloaded the .whl file.
