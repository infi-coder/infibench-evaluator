The error message `FormatException: Unexpected character (at character 1)` typically means that the response from the server is not a valid JSON string. 

Here are a few steps you can take to debug and solve this issue:

1. **Print the server response**: Before trying to decode the response, print it to the console. This will help you understand what you're receiving from the server.

```dart
print('Response body: ${response.body}');
```

2. **Check the server-side script**: Make sure that your PHP script is correctly outputting a JSON string. You can use `json_encode()` to convert an array or object into a JSON string.

3. **Check the response status code**: Before decoding the response, check if the request was successful by checking the status code. A status code of 200 indicates success.

```dart
if (response.statusCode == 200) {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} else {
  print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}.');
}
```

4. **Handle exceptions**: Wrap your `json.decode()` call in a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that might occur.

```dart
try {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} catch (e) {
  print('Error: $e');
}
```

Remember, the response from the server must be a valid JSON string. If it's not, you'll need to fix the server-side script. If the server-side script is correct and you're still having issues, there might be a problem with the request you're sending. Make sure the URL, headers, and body of the request are correct.
