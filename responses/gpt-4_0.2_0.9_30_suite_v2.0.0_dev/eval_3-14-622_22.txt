To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement a function that provides a `Shader` when given a `Rect` and a `ColorScheme`. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType, context: inout _ShapeStyle_Context) {
    }
    
    func makeShader(size: CGSize, colorScheme: ColorScheme, context: CGContext?) -> Shader {
        return Shader(color: .red)
    }
}
```

In this code, `RedShapeStyle` is conforming to `ShapeStyle` by implementing the required methods. The `makeShader` method returns a `Shader` that is simply red, which is what you want.
