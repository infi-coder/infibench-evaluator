Sure, here is a simple bash script to install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current python version
brew unlink python

# Install the required python version
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed python version
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will unlink your current version of Python and link to Python 3.6.5. If you have other applications depending on the current version of Python, they might not work properly.
