To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement a `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType)` method in your struct. However, `_ShapeStyle_ShapeType` is a private type, so you can't use it directly.

A workaround is to create a struct that wraps a `Color` and conforms to `ShapeStyle`. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        Color.red._apply(to: &shape)
    }
}
```

Please note that this is using private API, which is not recommended and may lead to issues. It's better to use `Color` directly or create a custom `View` that returns a `Color`.
