The error you're getting is because you're trying to overwrite the `$theme-colors` map after it's already been used in the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file. You should define your custom colors before importing the Bootstrap SCSS files.

Here's how you can do it:

```scss
// Define your custom colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color, // replace #your-color with your desired color
  // Add more colors if needed
);

// Import Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

// Import the rest of Bootstrap
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

This way, your custom colors will be used instead of the default ones. Make sure to replace `#your-color` with the actual color you want to use.

Also, please note that if you want to keep the other default colors and just change one or two, you should include them in your `$theme-colors` map as well. Otherwise, they will be undefined.
