Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a traditional RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` tool. Here are the steps:

1. Convert OpenSSH private key to RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for the passphrase (if any) of the key. After entering the passphrase, it will write the RSA private key out to the same file, `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

The `-p` option tells `ssh-keygen` to change the passphrase of a private key file. The `-m PEM` option tells it to write the key in the older PEM format.

2. Regarding the public key (`id_rsa.pub`), you don't need to convert it. The public key doesn't have a different format between OpenSSH and RSA. The server uses the public key to verify your identity, so as long as the private key you're using matches the public key you've given to the server administrator, you should be able to connect.

Remember to backup your keys before performing any operations on them.
