Font Awesome 5 has a few changes in the way you use it compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is now split into three different families: `Font Awesome 5 Free`, `Font Awesome 5 Brands`, and `Font Awesome 5 Pro`. The content codes have also changed.

For your code, you can try the following:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f105";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

The `font-weight` is added because Font Awesome 5 uses different weights to differentiate between solid (`font-weight: 900`), regular (`font-weight: 400`), and light (`font-weight: 300`) icons. The content code (`\f105`) is for the right arrow in Font Awesome 5.

Please note that you need to ensure that you have correctly included the Font Awesome 5 CSS in your project.
