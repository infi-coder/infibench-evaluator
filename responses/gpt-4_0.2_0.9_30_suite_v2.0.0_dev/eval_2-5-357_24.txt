Yes, you're correct. Since Spring 4.3, if a class, which is annotated with `@Component` or `@Service` or `@Repository`, contains a single constructor, the `@Autowired` annotation on that constructor is no longer necessary. Spring will use that constructor for autowiring by default.

However, if the class has multiple constructors, Spring won't know which one to use, so you'll need to add `@Autowired` to the constructor you want Spring to use for autowiring.

The reason people still use `@Autowired` on constructors could be due to:

1. **Backward compatibility**: Older versions of Spring required `@Autowired` for constructor injection.
2. **Explicitness**: It makes it clear that the constructor is used for autowiring, which can be helpful for readability, especially for those not familiar with the newer Spring feature.
3. **Multiple constructors**: If a class has more than one constructor, `@Autowired` is still needed to indicate which one to use for autowiring.
