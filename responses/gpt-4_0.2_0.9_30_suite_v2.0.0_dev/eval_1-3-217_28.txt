Sure, you can use the `torch.cat` function to concatenate the tensors along a new dimension. However, before you do that, you need to add an extra dimension to `d` to match the dimensions of `inps`. Here is how you can do it:

```python
import torch

def addTensor(inps, d):
    # Add an extra dimension to d
    d = d.unsqueeze(2)
    # Concatenate inps and d along the third dimension
    result = torch.cat((inps, d), 2)
    return result
```

In this function, `unsqueeze(2)` is used to add an extra dimension to `d` at the third dimension (0-indexed). Then, `torch.cat` is used to concatenate `inps` and `d` along the third dimension. The resulting tensor will have a size of [64, 161, 2].
