It seems like you're having trouble with your Jupyter notebook kernel in VS Code. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your Python interpreter**: Make sure you're using the correct Python interpreter for your Jupyter notebook. You can select the interpreter by clicking on the Python version in the bottom-left corner of the VS Code window.

2. **Reinstall Jupyter and ipykernel**: Try reinstalling Jupyter and ipykernel in your virtual environment. You can do this by activating your virtual environment and running the following commands:

```bash
conda activate da38
pip uninstall ipykernel jupyter
pip install ipykernel jupyter
```

3. **Update VS Code and Python extension**: Make sure you're using the latest version of VS Code and the Python extension. You can update VS Code by clicking on the gear icon in the bottom-left corner and selecting 'Check for Updates'. You can update the Python extension by clicking on the extensions icon in the activity bar on the side and searching for 'Python'. If an update is available, it will be indicated next to the extension.

4. **Check your Jupyter server logs**: If you're still having trouble, you can check your Jupyter server logs for any error messages. You can access these logs by clicking on the 'Jupyter' tab in the output panel at the bottom of the VS Code window.

5. **Reset VS Code settings**: If all else fails, you can try resetting your VS Code settings to their default values. You can do this by opening the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), typing 'Preferences: Open User Settings', and clicking on the 'Reset Setting' icon next to each modified setting.

If none of these steps work, please provide more information about your setup and the exact error message you're seeing.
