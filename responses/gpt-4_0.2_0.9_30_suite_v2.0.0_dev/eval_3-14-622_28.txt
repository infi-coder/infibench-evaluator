To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement a function that returns a `Shader`. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedStyle())
    }
}

struct RedStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        // Implementation goes here
    }
    
    func _makeView(geometry: _GraphValue<_ShapeStyle_ShapeType>, inputs: _ViewInputs) -> _ViewOutputs {
        // Implementation goes here
    }
}
```

However, `ShapeStyle` is a protocol that SwiftUI uses internally, and its methods are underscored, which means they are not intended for public use. 

Therefore, it's not recommended to conform to `ShapeStyle` directly. Instead, you can create a custom `View` that draws your shape and applies the color or style you want. If you want to use a custom color or gradient, you can create them directly without needing to conform to `ShapeStyle`.
