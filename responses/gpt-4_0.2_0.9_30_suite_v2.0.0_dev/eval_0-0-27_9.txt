Your code seems correct, and it should work as expected. However, there are a few things you can check if the loading state hangs:

1. **Network Connection**: Make sure your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. You can check this by trying to fetch data from another API.

2. **API Endpoint**: The API endpoint you're using (`https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io`) is a demo endpoint provided by Apollo for their documentation. It might be down or not working properly. You can check its status by opening the URL in a web browser.

3. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (e.g., `3.3.21`) and see if the issue persists.

4. **Error Handling**: You're logging the `error` object in the console. However, if the error is `null` or `undefined`, it won't give you much information. Try logging `error.message` instead to get a more detailed error message.

5. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, make sure 'Enable Network Inspect' is enabled. This will allow you to see the network requests made by Apollo Client in the Network tab.

6. **React Native Version**: You're using React Native version `0.68.1`, which doesn't exist at the moment. The latest version is `0.67.3`. Please check and correct your React Native version.

If none of these suggestions work, please provide more information about your development environment (e.g., React Native version, device/emulator used for testing, etc.) and any error messages you're seeing in the console.
