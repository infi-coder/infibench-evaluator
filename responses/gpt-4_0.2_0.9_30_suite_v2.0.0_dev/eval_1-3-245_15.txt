The issue you're facing is likely due to the incorrect path in your Dockerfile. You're copying your `app` directory into `/app` in your Docker image, but then you're trying to run `uvicorn` with `app.main:app` which is not the correct path.

Here's how you can revise your Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --requirement requirements.txt

COPY ./app .

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

In this revised Dockerfile, you're copying your `requirements.txt` into the `/app` directory in your Docker image, and then you're installing the Python dependencies from there. After that, you're copying your `app` directory into the `/app` directory in your Docker image. Finally, you're running `uvicorn` with `main:app`, which should be the correct path to your FastAPI application.

Also, make sure your `docker-compose.yml` file is correct. Here's an example:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

In this `docker-compose.yml` file, you're defining a single service named `web` that builds from the current directory (where your Dockerfile is located) and maps port 8000 in the Docker container to port 8000 on your host machine.
