The error you're seeing is because `pdftk` is not supported on macOS Catalina (10.15) and later versions. This is because Apple dropped support for 32-bit applications starting from Catalina, and `pdftk` is a 32-bit application.

However, there's a workaround to this problem. You can use `pdftk-java`, which is a port of `pdftk` to Java. Here's how you can install it:

1. First, you need to install Homebrew if you haven't already. Open Terminal and paste the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install `pdftk-java` using the following command:

```bash
brew install pdftk-java
```

3. Now, you need to create a symbolic link to `pdftk-java` so that you can use it as `pdftk`. Run the following command:

```bash
echo 'alias pdftk="/usr/local/bin/pdftk-java"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

4. Finally, you need to apply the changes to your current shell session:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, you should be able to use `pdftk` as usual.
