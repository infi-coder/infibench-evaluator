The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` is generated by the `bootJar` task in Spring Boot 2.5.0. This is a feature of the new version. If you don't want to generate the `*-plain.jar` file, you can disable the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file like this:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will prevent the generation of the `*-plain.jar` file. However, please note that this may affect the functionality of your application if it relies on the `bootJar` task.
