The error message you're seeing is because AWS Lambda is trying to execute a binary named `main` in the `/var/task` directory, but it can't find it. This is likely due to the fact that you're building your Go application on a Windows machine, which produces a `.exe` file, not a Linux binary that AWS Lambda can execute.

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code for Linux. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Set the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to `linux` and `amd64` respectively. This tells Go to build the code for a Linux operating system on an AMD64 processor, which is what AWS Lambda uses.

```bash
set GOOS=linux
set GOARCH=amd64
```

3. Build your Go code.

```bash
go build -o main main.go
```

4. Zip the `main` file.

```bash
zip function.zip main
```

5. Upload `function.zip` to AWS Lambda.

Now, when you test your Lambda function, it should work as expected. If you're still encountering issues, make sure that your handler is set to `main` in the AWS Lambda console.
