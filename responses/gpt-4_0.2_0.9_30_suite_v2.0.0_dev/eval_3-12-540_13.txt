Yes, in Flutter, you can draw vertical lines between components using the `VerticalDivider` widget. 

Here is a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line (divider) is drawn between two text components. The `VerticalDivider` widget allows you to customize the color, thickness, width, and indent of the divider. 

Please note that `VerticalDivider` is a widget that displays a vertical line with a padding on either side that separates its two parent widgets. It's essentially a `Container` with a `BoxDecoration`.

Also, remember that `VerticalDivider` is only visible when used in a `Row` widget. If you use it in a `Column` widget, it won't be visible because it will have a height of 0.
