The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` is generated by the `bootJar` task in Spring Boot 2.5.0. If you want to disable the generation of the `*-plain.jar` file, you can configure the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file like this:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will prevent the `bootJar` task from running, and thus the `*-plain.jar` file will not be generated. 

However, please note that the `*-plain.jar` file is a non-executable jar that might be useful in certain scenarios, such as when you want to use your application as a library. If you're sure you don't need it, you can disable the task as shown above.
