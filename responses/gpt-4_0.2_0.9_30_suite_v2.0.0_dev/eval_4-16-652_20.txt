AWS CLI version 2 uses a pager program for output by default. This can be disabled by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. You can do this in your bash script before calling the AWS CLI commands.

Here's how you can modify your script:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will disable the pager for the duration of the script. If you want to disable it permanently, you can add the `export AWS_PAGER=""` line to your shell profile file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash).
