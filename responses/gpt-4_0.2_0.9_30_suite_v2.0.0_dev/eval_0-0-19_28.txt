The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` suggests that npm is unable to find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry. This is likely because the package does not exist or the name is incorrect.

The correct package name for the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`. 

You should be able to install the package with the correct command:

```bash
npm install --save aws-sdk
```

This will install the AWS SDK and add it to your package.json file.
