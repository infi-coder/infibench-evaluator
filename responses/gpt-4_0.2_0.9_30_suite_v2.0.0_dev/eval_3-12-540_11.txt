Yes, you can draw a vertical line (vertical divider) between components in Flutter. You can use the `VerticalDivider` widget for this purpose.

Here is a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line is drawn between two text components. The `VerticalDivider` widget has properties like `color`, `thickness`, and `width` that you can adjust to suit your needs. 

Please note that the `VerticalDivider` widget is not visible if used in a Column widget, it's only visible in a Row widget.
