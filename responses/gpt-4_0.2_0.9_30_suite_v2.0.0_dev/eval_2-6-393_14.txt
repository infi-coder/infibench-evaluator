The error message you're seeing is because you're trying to create an index on a navigation property `Gender`. Entity Framework does not support this. Indexes can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

You should create an index on the `GenderId` property instead, which is the foreign key property. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);` creates an index on the `GenderId` column in the `Users` table.
