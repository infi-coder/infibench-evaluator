In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, it actually modifies the column names to make them unique. The column names of the resulting data frame would be "a" and "a.1". 

So, to select the second column by name, you should use "a.1" instead of "a". Here is how you can do it:

```r
second_col <- d3$"a.1"
```

This will select the second column named "a.1" from the data frame `d3` and assign it to the variable `second_col`.
