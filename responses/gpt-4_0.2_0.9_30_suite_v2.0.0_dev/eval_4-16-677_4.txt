The issue here is that you're using single quotes around your variable `$searchT` in the `grep` command. In bash, single quotes preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes, so your variable isn't being expanded to its value. 

You should use double quotes instead. Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

Also, note that I moved the `wc -l` command to be part of the first `grep` command in the `echo` statement. This is because `wc -l` counts the number of lines, and you want it to count the number of lines that match your search term, not the number of lines in the entire file.
