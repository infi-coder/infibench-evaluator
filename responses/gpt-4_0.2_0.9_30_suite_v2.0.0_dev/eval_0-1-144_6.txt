You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This pseudo-element is used to create the arrow. Here is the CSS code:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is expanded */
    color: green;
}

.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is collapsed */
    color: green;
}
```

You can add this CSS code to your CSS file or inside a `<style>` tag in your HTML file. This will change the color of the arrow to green both when the accordion is expanded and when it is collapsed.

Please note that this code assumes that you are using the default Bootstrap 5 accordion. If you have customized the accordion or are using a different version of Bootstrap, the code might need to be adjusted.
