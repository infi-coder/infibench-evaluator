The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. Without these security features, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

Here's how you can enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file (`elasticsearch.yml`). The location of this file depends on your installation. If you installed Elasticsearch with Homebrew, the configuration file is likely located at `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`.

2. Add the following lines to the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

If you're running Elasticsearch in a development environment and you don't want to enable these security features, you can suppress this warning by adding the following line to your `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: false
```

Again, save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

Please note that disabling security is not recommended for production environments. If you're running Elasticsearch in a production environment, you should enable the built-in security features as described above.
