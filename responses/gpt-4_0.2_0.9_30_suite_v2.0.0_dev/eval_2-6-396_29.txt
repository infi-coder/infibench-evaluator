The problem is that you are trying to create an index on a navigation property `Gender`. EF Core doesn't support this. 

Indexes in Entity Framework Core are used to improve the performance of data retrieval operations in a database. They are data structures that hold a set of pointers to records in a table, and they are typically used on columns that are frequently queried in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, or ORDER BY clauses. 

However, indexes can only be created on scalar properties of an entity, not on navigation properties. A scalar property is a property that holds a single value, like a number or a string. A navigation property, on the other hand, is a property that holds a reference to another entity or a collection of entities, and it is used to create relationships between entities.

So, you should remove the line that tries to create an index on the `Gender` navigation property:

```c#
user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);
```

Your `OnModelCreating` method should look like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

If you want to create an index on `GenderId` (which is a foreign key), you can do so like this:

```c#
user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
```

This will create an index on the `GenderId` column in the `User` table, which can improve the performance of queries that filter or sort data by `GenderId`.
