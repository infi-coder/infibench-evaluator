The `Get-Service` cmdlet in PowerShell does not provide the service description. However, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to get the service description. Here is an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service" | 
Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description | 
Out-GridView
```

This command will get all services and their properties using WMI, then select the Name, DisplayName, and Description properties, and finally output the results in a grid view.

If you want to get the description of a specific service, you can filter it by the service name. Here is an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service Where Name='wuauserv'" | 
Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description
```

This command will get the Windows Update service (wuauserv) and its properties, and then select the Name, DisplayName, and Description properties.
