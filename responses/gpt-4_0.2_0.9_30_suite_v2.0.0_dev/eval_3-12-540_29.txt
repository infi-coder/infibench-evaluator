Yes, you can draw vertical lines between components in Flutter using the `VerticalDivider` widget. 

Here is a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.black,
      thickness: 2,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line is drawn between two text components. The `VerticalDivider` widget is used to create the line, with properties to set the color and thickness of the line. The `Expanded` widget is used to ensure that the text components and the line take up equal space in the row.
