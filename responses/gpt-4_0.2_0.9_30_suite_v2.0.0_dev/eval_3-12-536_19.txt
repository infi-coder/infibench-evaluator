You can use `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton`, and `TextButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property.

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with border-radius in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {},
  style: ButtonStyle(
    shape: MaterialStateProperty.all<RoundedRectangleBorder>(
      RoundedRectangleBorder(
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(18.0),
      )
    )
  ),
  child: Text('Button'),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton` is used, but you can replace it with `OutlinedButton` or `TextButton` as per your requirements. The `shape` property is used to define the shape of the button. The `RoundedRectangleBorder` widget is used with the `borderRadius` property to make the button rounded. The `borderRadius` property takes a `BorderRadius` widget where you can specify the radius of the border.
