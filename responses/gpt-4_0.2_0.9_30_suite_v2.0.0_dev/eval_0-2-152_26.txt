You can use the `.toast('show')` method to show the toast. Here is how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event, like a button click, you can put the code inside an event handler. For example:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function() {
  $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

This will show the toast when a button with the id `myButton` is clicked.

Also, make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap JS and CSS files in your HTML file. The toast component requires the Bootstrap's JavaScript and jQuery. If you haven't included them, the toast won't work. Here is how you can include them:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- JS, Popper.js, and jQuery -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Please replace the version numbers with the ones you are using.
