In Rust, you don't have null pointers like in C or C++. Instead, Rust has the `Option` type for optional values. `Option` is an enum that can be either `Some(value)` or `None`.

If you want to implement a stack using pointers, you can use `Option<Box<Node>>` for the `next` field in `Node` and the `top` field in `Stack`. Here's how you can do it:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

Now, you can check if `top` is `None` (which would be equivalent to a null pointer in other languages) like this:

```rust
if self.top.is_none() {
    // top is None
} else {
    // top is Some
}
```

Or you can use pattern matching:

```rust
match self.top {
    None => {
        // top is None
    }
    Some(_) => {
        // top is Some
    }
}
```

In Rust, you don't have to worry about null pointer dereference because the language forces you to handle the `None` case. This is one of the ways Rust provides memory safety.
