You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. This object is part of the Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library. Here's a simple function to copy text to the clipboard:

```vba
Sub CopyTextToClipboard(text As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText text
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
End Sub
```

You can call this function like this:

```vba
Call CopyTextToClipboard(Me.NodeKey.Value)
```

If you get an error about `MSForms.DataObject`, you might need to add a reference to Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library. To do this:

1. In the VBA editor, go to `Tools` -> `References`.
2. In the References dialog, scroll down and check `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library`.
3. Click `OK`.

If you can't find `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library`, you can add it by browsing for `FM20.DLL` in the `System32` directory.
