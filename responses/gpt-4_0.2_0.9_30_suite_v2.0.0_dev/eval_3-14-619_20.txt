The issue here is that `@Binding` does not own the state, it just references it. In your `ContentView`, you're toggling `isSelected` but there's no state in `ContentView` that SwiftUI could observe to redraw the view.

You should use `@State` in the view that owns the state and `@Binding` in the view that needs to mutate the state but does not own it.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isSelected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        ToggleView(isSelected: $isSelected)
    }
}

struct ToggleView: View {
    @Binding var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

In this code, `ContentView` owns the state and `ToggleView` mutates it.
