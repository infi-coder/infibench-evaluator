Sure, here is a bash script that will install Python 3.6.5 using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink current python version
brew unlink python

# Install python 3.6.5
brew install python@3.6

# Link python 3.6.5
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will unlink the current version of Python that you have installed via Homebrew. If you have any other versions of Python installed that you don't want to unlink, you may need to adjust the script accordingly.
