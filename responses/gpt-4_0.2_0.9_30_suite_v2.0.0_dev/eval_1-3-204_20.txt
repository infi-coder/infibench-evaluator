The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `rename` function is being called on a `Series` object, not a `DataFrame` object. The `groupby` function followed by the `mean` function returns a `Series` object, not a `DataFrame` object. The `rename` function's `columns` parameter is only applicable to `DataFrame` objects.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg.columns = ['t', 'mean']
    return avg
```

This function first groups the DataFrame `df` by the "t" column and calculates the mean of the "p" column. The `reset_index` function is used to convert the `Series` object back into a `DataFrame` object. Then, the columns of the `DataFrame` are renamed to 't' and 'mean'. The `DataFrame` with the renamed columns is then returned.
