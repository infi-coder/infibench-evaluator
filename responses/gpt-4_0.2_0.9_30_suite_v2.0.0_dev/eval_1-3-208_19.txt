Sure, I can help with that. The problem with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is in the `correct` string. What you want to do is check if each character in the input string is in the `correct` string. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)
```

This function will return `True` if all characters in `text` are in `correct`, and `False` otherwise. The `all` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression `(char in correct for char in text)`) are `True`.

You can use this function like this:

```python
text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

This will print "Success" if the input string contains only letters and digits, and "Failure" otherwise.
