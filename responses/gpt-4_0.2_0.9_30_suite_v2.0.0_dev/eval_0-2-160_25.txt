Source maps are files that associate the transpiled, minified, or otherwise transformed source code to the original source code. They are primarily used for debugging purposes.

When `"sourceMap": true` is set in your `tsconfig.json`, it tells the TypeScript compiler to generate corresponding `.map` files for each `.js` file it outputs. These `.map` files are source maps that map the JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. This is extremely useful when you're debugging your application in a browser, because it allows you to see and debug the original TypeScript code instead of the transpiled JavaScript code.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the TypeScript compiler will not generate these `.map` files. This means that if you debug your application in a browser, you'll be seeing and debugging the transpiled JavaScript code, not the original TypeScript code. This can make debugging more difficult if you're not familiar with the JavaScript code that TypeScript outputs.

In terms of the running application, there won't be any noticeable change whether source maps are enabled or not. They don't affect the execution of your code, they're purely a development and debugging aid.
