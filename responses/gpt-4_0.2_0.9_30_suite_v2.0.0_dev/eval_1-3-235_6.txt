The error you're seeing is because the value '2021.0' is a string representation of a float, not an integer. You can't directly convert it to an integer using `int()`. You need to convert it to a float first, then to an integer.

Here's how you can modify your function:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

This function first converts the 'year' column to float, then to integer. This should work for your case.
