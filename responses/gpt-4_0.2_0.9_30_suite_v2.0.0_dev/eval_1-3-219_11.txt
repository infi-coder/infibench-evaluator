There could be several reasons why you're unable to start a Jupyter notebook on VS Code. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. **Check your Python and Jupyter installations**: Make sure you have Python and Jupyter installed in your environment. You can check this by activating your environment and running `python --version` and `jupyter --version`. If either of these commands fail, you'll need to install the missing package.

2. **Check your Python interpreter in VS Code**: Make sure you have selected the correct Python interpreter in VS Code. You can do this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of the status bar or by using the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and typing 'Python: Select Interpreter'. Make sure to select the interpreter that corresponds to your 'da38' environment.

3. **Check your Jupyter server settings in VS Code**: In VS Code, go to the settings (`File > Preferences > Settings` or `Ctrl+,`) and search for 'Jupyter Server URI'. Make sure it's set to 'local' if you want to use a local Jupyter server.

4. **Try starting Jupyter from the command line**: Try to start a Jupyter notebook from the command line to see if there are any error messages. You can do this by activating your environment and running `jupyter notebook`.

5. **Reinstall the Python extension in VS Code**: If all else fails, you can try reinstalling the Python extension in VS Code. You can do this by going to the extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), searching for the Python extension, clicking on the gear icon and selecting 'Uninstall'. After uninstalling, install it again from the marketplace.

If none of these steps work, please provide more information about your setup (e.g., the output of `conda list` in your environment, any error messages when starting Jupyter from the command line, etc.) so that we can better assist you.
