Sure, you can use the `last:` variant provided by Tailwind CSS to target the last element in a list. Here's how you can modify your code:

```html
  <ul>
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      :class="{ 'border-b border-black': index !== items.length - 1 }"
      class="border-solid"
    >
      Item
    </li>
  </ul>
```

In this code, I'm using Vue's dynamic class binding (`:class`) to conditionally apply the `border-b border-black` classes. The condition `index !== items.length - 1` checks if the current item is not the last one in the list. If it's not, the classes are applied, otherwise, they are not.

Please note that you need to enable the `last` variant in your Tailwind CSS configuration for some utilities. However, in this case, we are using Vue's dynamic class binding which doesn't require enabling the `last` variant.
