You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by using the `ssh-add` command. However, the key generated by Puttygen is in `.ppk` format, which is not directly usable by `ssh-add`. You need to convert it to OpenSSH format first.

Here are the steps:

1. Open Puttygen, then load your `.ppk` key file.

2. Once the key is loaded, go to `Conversions` > `Export OpenSSH key`. Save the key to your desired location.

3. Open Git Bash.

4. Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent. If you haven't started the ssh-agent yet, start it by typing:

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
```

5. Then add your SSH key:

```bash
ssh-add /path/to/your/openssh/key
```

Replace `/path/to/your/openssh/key` with the path where you saved your OpenSSH key.

Now, your SSH key is added to Git Bash and you can use it to clone your repository.
