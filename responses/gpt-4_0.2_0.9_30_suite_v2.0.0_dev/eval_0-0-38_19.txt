Sure, you can use async/await with toPromise() to wait for the Observable to complete. Here is the revised code:

```javascript
async getData() {
  this.newIds = await this.repository.getById(Ids).toPromise();
  console.log(this.newIds);
}
```

Remember to call the `getData()` function to execute the code.
