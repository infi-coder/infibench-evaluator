Assuming that the line you want to split is a string with values separated by spaces (or any other delimiter), you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the string into an array and then assign the array elements to the different columns. Here's how you can do it:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline) ' splits the string into an array based on spaces
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0) ' first element of array
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1) ' second element of array
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2) ' third element of array
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3) ' fourth element of array
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4) ' fifth element of array
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code assumes that `textline` contains exactly 5 space-separated values. If the number of values or the delimiter is different, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.
