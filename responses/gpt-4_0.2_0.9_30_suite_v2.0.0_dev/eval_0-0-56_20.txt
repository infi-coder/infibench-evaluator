The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vite's dev server is binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) by default, which is not accessible from outside of the Docker container. 

To make it accessible, you need to bind the server to `0.0.0.0` which will make it accessible from any IP address. You can do this by adding `host: '0.0.0.0'` to the `server` section in your `vite.config.ts` file.

Here's how your `vite.config.ts` should look like:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0',
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

Now, when you run your Vite server inside the Docker container, it should be accessible from your host machine.
