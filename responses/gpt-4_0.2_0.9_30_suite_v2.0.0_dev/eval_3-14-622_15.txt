To conform to `ShapeStyle`, you need to create a struct that conforms to `ShapeStyle` protocol and implement the `makeBody` function. Here is how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {}
    func _makeView(view: _GraphValue<_ShapeView<Self, _ShapeStyle_ShapeType>>, inputs: _ViewInputs) -> _ViewOutputs {}
}
```

However, `ShapeStyle` is a very low-level protocol and its methods are underscored, which means they are not intended to be used directly. It's usually better to use one of the provided types that conform to `ShapeStyle`, such as `Color`, `Gradient`, etc.

In your case, if you want to create a custom `ShapeStyle`, you might want to create a custom `View` that returns a `Color` or `Gradient` instead.
