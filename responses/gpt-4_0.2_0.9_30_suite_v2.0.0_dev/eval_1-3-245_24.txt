The error message `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'` indicates that Python cannot find the `app` module. This is likely because the `app` directory is not in a location where Python looks for modules.

In your Dockerfile, you're copying the `app` directory into `/app` in the Docker image. However, this directory (`/app`) is not in Python's module search path by default.

To fix this, you can set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable in your Dockerfile to include the `/app` directory. Here's how you can modify your Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /
RUN pip install --requirement /requirements.txt

COPY ./app /app

# Set PYTHONPATH=/app so Python includes /app in its module search path
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

This should resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` you're seeing.
