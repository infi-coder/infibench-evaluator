There could be several reasons why you're unable to start a Jupyter notebook in VS Code. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially solve the issue:

1. **Check your Python interpreter**: Make sure you have the correct Python interpreter selected for your workspace. You can do this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window and selecting the correct interpreter from the list.

2. **Check your Jupyter server**: Try starting a Jupyter server manually from the command line to see if there are any issues. You can do this by activating your conda environment and running `jupyter notebook`.

3. **Reinstall the Python extension**: There might be an issue with the Python extension itself. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the Python extension in VS Code.

4. **Check your Python and Jupyter installations**: Make sure Python and Jupyter are correctly installed in your conda environment. You can do this by activating your conda environment and running `python --version` and `jupyter --version`.

5. **Check your VS Code settings**: There might be an issue with your VS Code settings. Try resetting your settings to the default and see if that solves the issue.

6. **Check for error messages**: Look for any error messages in the VS Code output panel. This might give you a clue as to what's going wrong.

If none of these steps solve the issue, it might be a bug with VS Code or the Python extension. In that case, you might want to report the issue to the VS Code or Python extension GitHub page.
