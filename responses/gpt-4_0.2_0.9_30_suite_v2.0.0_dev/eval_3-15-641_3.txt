Unfortunately, Excel VBA does not have built-in support for interacting with SharePoint or OneDrive URLs directly. However, you can use the `Environ` function to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. Here's a simple example:

```vba
Sub GetOneDrivePath()
    Dim OneDrivePath As String
    OneDrivePath = Environ("OneDrive")
    MsgBox OneDrivePath
End Sub
```

This will return the root path of the OneDrive folder for the current user. You can then append your specific folder names to this path.

However, this method has limitations:

1. It assumes that all users have their OneDrive set up in the default location.
2. It does not handle cases where users have multiple OneDrive accounts (e.g., personal and business).

To handle these cases, you might need to use the Windows API or a third-party library to interact with SharePoint/OneDrive. Alternatively, you could consider using a different technology stack that has better support for SharePoint/OneDrive, such as PowerShell or .NET.
