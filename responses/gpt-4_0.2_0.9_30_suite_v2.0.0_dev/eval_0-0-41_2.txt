The issue with your code is that you're not handling the error case when the user denies the permission to access the location. The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method accepts two callbacks, the first one is for success and the second one is for error. You should use the error callback to handle the case when the user denies the permission.

Here is the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the user denies the permission to access the location, the error callback will be called and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console. If the geolocation is not supported by the browser, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged to the console.
