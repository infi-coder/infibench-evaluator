You can achieve this by first creating a dictionary where the keys are the first 4 elements of `b` and the values are the corresponding elements in `rest`. Then, you can iterate over the `last` list and replace the elements if they exist in the dictionary. Here is the function:

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    # Create a dictionary where the keys are the first 4 elements of b and the values are the elements in rest
    replace_dict = {b[i]: rest[i] for i in range(4)}
    
    # Replace the elements in last if they exist in the dictionary
    last = [replace_dict.get(i, i) for i in last]
    
    return last
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

print(ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last))
```

This will output:

```python
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

This function works by creating a dictionary that maps the first 4 elements of `b` to the corresponding elements in `rest`. Then, it iterates over the `last` list and replaces each element with its corresponding value in the dictionary if it exists. If the element does not exist in the dictionary, it is left unchanged.
