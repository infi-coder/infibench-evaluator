The `_io.BytesIO` object is a type of stream that operates on bytes. If you have a `_io.BytesIO` object, you can get its contents as a bytes object by calling the `getvalue()` method.

Here's how you can modify your function:

```python
def uncompress_body(self, compression_type, body):
    if isinstance(body, _io.BytesIO):
        body = body.getvalue()  # convert BytesIO to bytes

    if compression_type == 'gzip' or compression_type == 'compress':
        return zlib.decompress(body)
    elif compression_type == 'deflate':
        compressor = zlib.compressobj(9, zlib.DEFLATED, -zlib.MAX_WBITS)
        compressed = compressor.compress(body)
        compressed += compressor.flush()
        return base64.b64encode(compressed)

    return body
```

This will ensure that the `body` is a bytes-like object before it is passed to `zlib.decompress()`.
