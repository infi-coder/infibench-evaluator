In R, you cannot have two columns with the same name in a data frame. When you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, R will automatically rename the columns to make them unique. In your case, the column names will be `a` and `a.1`.

To select the second column by name, you can use the `$` operator or the `[[` operator with the correct column name. Here is how you can do it:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

or

```r
second_col <- d3[["a.1"]]
```

Both of these lines will select the second column named `a.1` from the data frame `d3` and assign it to the variable `second_col`.
