This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being associated with a target. Here's how you can fix it:

1. Open your SwiftUI file in Xcode.
2. Click on the file name in the Project Navigator.
3. In the File Inspector on the right, under "Target Membership", make sure your app's target is checked.

If the target is already checked, try the following:

1. Clean your build folder (Product -> Clean Build Folder).
2. Restart Xcode.
3. Try to run the preview again.

If the issue persists, it might be a bug in Xcode. Consider updating Xcode to the latest version or filing a bug report with Apple.
