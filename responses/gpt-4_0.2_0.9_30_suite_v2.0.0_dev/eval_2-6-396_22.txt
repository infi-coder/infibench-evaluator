The error you're encountering is because you're trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`). EF Core does not support this. 

Indexes in Entity Framework are used to speed up the performance of data retrieval operations on a database. They can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

You should create an index on the `GenderId` property instead, which is the foreign key property. Here's how you can do it:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

Now, when you run `dotnet ef add migration User`, it should work without any issues.
