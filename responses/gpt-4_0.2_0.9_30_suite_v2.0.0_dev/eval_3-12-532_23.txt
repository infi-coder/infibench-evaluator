The error message indicates that the response from the server is not a valid JSON. This could be due to several reasons:

1. The server is not returning a JSON: Check the response from the server to ensure it's returning a valid JSON. You can print the response body before decoding it to check what it contains. 

```dart
print('Response body: ${response.body}');
```

2. There is a leading/trailing whitespace: Sometimes, the server might return a JSON with leading or trailing whitespaces which can cause this error. You can try trimming the response before decoding it.

```dart
List data = json.decode(response.body.trim());
```

3. The server is returning an error message: If there's an error on the server side, it might return an error message instead of a JSON. Again, printing the response body will help you check this.

4. The server response is not encoded in UTF-8: If the server is returning the response in an encoding other than UTF-8, it can cause this error. You can try setting the `charset` in the `Accept` header to `utf-8`.

```dart
headers:{ "Accept": "application/json; charset=utf-8" }
```

If none of these solutions work, you might need to debug the server side code to see what it's returning.
