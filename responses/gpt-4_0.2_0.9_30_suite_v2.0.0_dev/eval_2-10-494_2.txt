The error message "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args`" is coming from rust-analyzer, which is a language server protocol implementation for Rust. It's not an error from the Rust compiler itself. 

Rust-analyzer sometimes has issues with macro resolution, especially in complex scenarios or when macros are used in certain ways. This is a known limitation of rust-analyzer and is being actively worked on by the developers.

In your case, the error is likely a false positive, especially since the Rust compiler itself (via `cargo check`, `cargo run`, and `cargo test`) doesn't report any issues.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Update rust-analyzer**: Make sure you're using the latest version of rust-analyzer. Updates are released frequently and the issue you're experiencing might have been fixed in a newer version.

2. **Restart your editor**: Sometimes, simply restarting your editor can resolve temporary issues with rust-analyzer.

3. **Check your code for macro-related issues**: Although it's unlikely in your case, make sure your code doesn't have any subtle issues related to macros. For example, make sure all required crates are properly imported and all macros are correctly defined and invoked.

If none of these steps help, you might just have to ignore this error for now. As long as your code compiles and runs correctly, this rust-analyzer error shouldn't prevent you from working on your project.
