The error you're seeing is because the `pdftk` binary you're trying to run is not compatible with your version of macOS. This is a common issue on macOS Catalina and later, because Apple dropped support for 32-bit applications starting with Catalina.

Here's how you can solve this issue:

1. Uninstall the current version of `pdftk`:

    ```bash
    brew uninstall pdftk
    ```

2. Install `pdftk-java` instead. It's a reimplementation of `pdftk` in Java, so it's compatible with Catalina and later versions of macOS:

    ```bash
    brew install pdftk-java
    ```

3. Now, you should be able to use `pdftk` as before, but the command is `pdftk-java`:

    ```bash
    pdftk-java --help
    ```

Note: If you haven't installed Homebrew yet, you can install it by running the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
