You can use `TextButton`, `ElevatedButton`, and `OutlinedButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property. 

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with border-radius in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {},
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20), // radius of 20
    ),
  ),
  child: Text('Rounded Button'),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton` is used. The `shape` property is placed inside the `style` property. `shape` is set to `RoundedRectangleBorder` with a `borderRadius` of 20. This will create a button with rounded corners. The same can be done with `TextButton` and `OutlinedButton`.
