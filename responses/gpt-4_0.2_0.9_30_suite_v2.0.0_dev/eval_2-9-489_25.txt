The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. This means that without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Open your `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. This file is usually located in the `/etc/elasticsearch` or `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save and close the file.

4. Restart Elasticsearch.

Please note that enabling security will require all users to authenticate. By default, Elasticsearch includes the built-in `elastic` superuser. You can use this account to create additional users. The password for the `elastic` user is randomly generated when you install Elasticsearch. You can change it by using the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` command.

Also, keep in mind that enabling transport SSL might require additional configuration, such as providing the path to your SSL certificate and private key in the `elasticsearch.yml` file.

If you're using Elasticsearch for development purposes and want to disable this warning without enabling security, you can add the following line to your `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: false
```

This will disable the security features and the warning, but it will also make your Elasticsearch cluster accessible without authentication.

Remember to restart Elasticsearch after making these changes.
