The error message indicates that the zlib library, which is a required dependency for Pillow, could not be found. 

However, the main issue here is that you're trying to install Pillow 6.0.0 which does not support Python 3.8. You can see this warning in your error message:

```bash
C:\Users\rijal\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-install-di5is9gd\Pillow\setup.py:29: RuntimeWarning: Pillow does not yet support Python 3.8 and does not yet provide prebuilt Windows binaries. We do not recommend building from source on Windows.
```

To solve this issue, you should install a newer version of Pillow that supports Python 3.8. You can do this by just running `pip install pillow` without specifying a version, which will install the latest version.

If you're using a virtual environment (which you should be), make sure you've activated it first. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
# activate the virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# now install Pillow
pip install pillow
```

If you still encounter issues, it might be due to pip not being updated. You can update pip using the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then try installing Pillow again. If the problem persists, please let me know.
