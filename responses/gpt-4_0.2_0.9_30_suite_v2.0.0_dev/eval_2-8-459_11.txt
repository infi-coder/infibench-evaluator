The error message indicates that Go is unable to find the specific version of the module you're trying to import. This could be due to a number of reasons:

1. **The module version does not exist**: Ensure that the version `v0.1.5` of `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` actually exists. You can verify this by visiting the URL `https://github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client/releases`.

2. **Access to the private repository**: If the repository is private, you need to ensure that the machine has the necessary permissions to access it. This usually involves setting up SSH keys or providing a username and password. You mentioned that you have access to the repository, but you need to ensure that the Go toolchain is able to use these credentials.

3. **Go Proxy settings**: Go uses a module proxy to download modules. By default, this is set to `https://proxy.golang.org`. However, this proxy does not support private modules. You can disable the Go proxy for your private modules by setting the `GOPRIVATE` environment variable to match your module path:

    ```bash
    export GOPRIVATE=github.ibm.com/kms/*
    ```

    This tells Go to fetch these modules directly rather than through the proxy.

4. **Network issues**: If you're behind a corporate firewall or VPN, it might be blocking access to the module. You can try to temporarily disable these to see if it resolves the issue.

To debug this further, you can use the `-x` flag with the `go get` command to see more detailed output:

```bash
go get -x github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
```

This will print out all the commands that `go get` is running, which might give you more insight into what's going wrong.
