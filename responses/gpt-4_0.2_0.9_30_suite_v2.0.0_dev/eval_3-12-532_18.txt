The error `FormatException: Unexpected character (at character 1)` usually occurs when the JSON you are trying to decode is not properly formatted. This could be due to a variety of reasons:

1. The server might not be returning a JSON at all. It could be returning HTML or plain text.
2. The JSON returned by the server might be malformed.
3. There might be some invisible characters in the JSON that are causing the parsing to fail.

Here are some steps you can take to debug and solve this issue:

1. **Print the response body**: Before trying to decode the JSON, print the response body to the console. This will allow you to see exactly what you are trying to decode.

```dart
print('Response body: ${response.body}');
```

2. **Check the server response**: Use a tool like Postman to send a request to the server and see what it returns. Make sure it's returning a valid JSON.

3. **Check the JSON format**: If the server is indeed returning a JSON, make sure it's properly formatted. You can use a JSON validator tool to check this.

4. **Handle the error**: You can use a try-catch block to handle the `FormatException` and print more detailed information about the error.

```dart
try {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} catch (e) {
  print('Error: $e');
}
```

5. **Check your PHP script**: Make sure your PHP script is correctly outputting a JSON response. You should be using `json_encode` to encode your response and you should set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.

```php
header('Content-Type: application/json');
echo json_encode($your_data);
```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the issue causing the `FormatException`.
