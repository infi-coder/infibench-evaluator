The error you are encountering is because AWS Lambda expects a Linux binary, but you are uploading a Windows binary. 

When you run `go build main.go` on a Windows machine, it will produce a Windows binary (`main.exe`). AWS Lambda runs on a Linux-based environment, so it expects a Linux binary. 

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code for Linux. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Set the environment variables for Linux:

    ```bash
    SET GOOS=linux
    SET GOARCH=amd64
    ```

3. Build your Go code:

    ```bash
    go build -o main main.go
    ```

4. Zip the `main` file:

    ```bash
    zip deployment.zip main
    ```

5. Now, you can upload `deployment.zip` to AWS Lambda.

Remember, the handler should be set to `main` in AWS Lambda configuration. 

This will produce a Linux binary that can be executed in the AWS Lambda environment.
