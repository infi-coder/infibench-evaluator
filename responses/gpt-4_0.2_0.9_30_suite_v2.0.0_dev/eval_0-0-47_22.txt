In TypeScript, you can define an array of objects as a parameter by using the `Array<>` syntax or `[]` after the type. Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
bagTotal = (products: Array<{name: string, price: number, description: string}>) => {
 // function does stuff
}
```

Or, using the `[]` syntax:

```typescript
bagTotal = (products: {name: string, price: number, description: string}[]) => {
 // function does stuff
}
```

Both of these definitions mean the same thing: `products` is an array of objects, where each object has a `name` property of type `string`, a `price` property of type `number`, and a `description` property of type `string`.
