The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` suggests that npm is unable to find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry. 

This is likely because there is no package named `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry. The correct package name for the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js is `aws-sdk`.

You should replace `aws-sdk-js` with `aws-sdk` in your `package.json` file or in your `npm install` command.

So, instead of running:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk-js
```

You should run:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

This will install the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js and should resolve your issue.
