Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. `query` and `currentSheet` are not declared. You should declare them as `String` and `Worksheet` respectively.
2. You are trying to use `query.Name` but `query` is a string, not an object. You should use `query` directly.
3. You are not using `currentSheet` anywhere in your code.

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim targetSheet As Worksheet

    ' Get the query from Sheet6
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Set the target sheet
    Set targetSheet = Sheets("target")

    ' Create a ListObject with a Query Table
    With targetSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=targetSheet.Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code will get the query from cell A1 in Sheet6, and then use that query to create a new QueryTable in the target sheet. The QueryTable will be refreshed immediately.
