The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method is asynchronous and takes two callback functions as arguments. The first callback is invoked when the position data is available, and the second callback is invoked when an error occurs.

In your case, you want to log "Location accessed" when the position data is available, and "User not allowed" when an error occurs. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, the first callback logs "Location accessed" when the position data is available, and the second callback logs "User not allowed" when an error occurs. If the geolocation API is not supported by the browser, it logs "Geolocation is not supported by this browser."
