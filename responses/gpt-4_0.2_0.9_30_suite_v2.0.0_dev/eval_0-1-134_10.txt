It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a package called Emmet. Emmet is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allow for high-speed coding and editing in HTML, XML, CSS, and other web development languages.

The feature you're describing, where you can type `.classname` and then hit tab to automatically generate a div with that class, is a part of Emmet's abbreviation system.

For example, if you type:

```
.classname
```

And then hit the `Tab` key, it will automatically expand to:

```html
<div class="classname"></div>
```

If you're not able to use this feature, it could be because:

1. You don't have Emmet installed. Emmet comes pre-installed with some text editors (like VS Code), but not all. If you're using a text editor that doesn't come with Emmet, you'll need to install it manually.

2. You're not in an HTML file. Emmet's abbreviation system only works in files that it recognizes as HTML. Make sure that the file you're working in is saved with an `.html` extension.

3. Your text editor isn't in "auto complete" mode. Some text editors have a mode that needs to be enabled for Emmet to work.

If you're still having trouble, I'd recommend checking the documentation for your specific text editor to see how to enable Emmet.
