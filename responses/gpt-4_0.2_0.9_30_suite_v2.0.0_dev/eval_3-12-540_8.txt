Yes, you can draw vertical lines between components in Flutter using the `VerticalDivider` widget. 

Here is an example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, `VerticalDivider` is used to draw a vertical line between two text widgets. The `color`, `thickness`, and `width` properties are used to customize the appearance of the divider.

Please note that `VerticalDivider` is a widget that displays a vertical line with a desired thickness and color at the center of its parent widget. If you want the line to be at a specific position, you might need to use a different approach, such as using a `Container` with a border.
