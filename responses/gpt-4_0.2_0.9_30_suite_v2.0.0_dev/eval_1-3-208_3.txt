Sure, the problem with your code is that it checks if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, not if each character of the input string is in the `correct` string. Here is the corrected function:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)
```

This function uses the `all` function, which returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the string `text`) are `True`. The `char in correct` checks if each character in `text` is in the `correct` string. If any character is not in `correct`, `all` will return `False`.
