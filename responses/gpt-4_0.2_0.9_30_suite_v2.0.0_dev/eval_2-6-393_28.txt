The error message you're seeing is because you're trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`). In Entity Framework, you can't create an index on a navigation property directly. 

Indexes are used to speed up the performance of data retrieval operations on a database table. In the context of a relational database, an index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. However, indexes are used on columns, not on the relations between tables.

If you want to create an index on `GenderId` (the foreign key for the `Gender` navigation property), you should do it like this:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);` creates an index on the `GenderId` column of the `User` table.
