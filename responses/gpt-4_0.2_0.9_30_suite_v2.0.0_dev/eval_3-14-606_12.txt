It seems like there's a bit of confusion here. iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" that you can enable or disable like Android. The alert you're seeing is likely related to the provisioning profile used to sign the app you're trying to install.

Here are the steps to install a provisioned app:

1. Connect your iOS device to your Mac.
2. Open Xcode.
3. Go to `Window` -> `Devices and Simulators`.
4. Under the `Devices` tab, select your device.
5. Click the `+` button under `Installed Apps`.
6. Select the `.ipa` file of the app you want to install.

If you're still seeing the alert, it's possible that the provisioning profile used to sign the app doesn't include your device or your developer account. You'll need to get a new `.ipa` file signed with a provisioning profile that includes your device and your developer account.

If you're the developer of the app, you can do this in Xcode by going to `Project` -> `Signing & Capabilities` -> `All` and making sure your device and developer account are included in the provisioning profile.

If you're not the developer of the app, you'll need to contact the developer and ask them to provide a new `.ipa` file.
