The error message indicates that the Pillow library could not find the zlib library, which is a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source. 

However, the Pillow version you're trying to install (6.0.0) does not support Python 3.8 as mentioned in the error message. 

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Upgrade pip to the latest version:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

2. Install the latest version of Pillow:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

This should install the latest version of Pillow that supports Python 3.8.

If you still encounter the zlib error, it means zlib is not installed on your system. You can download zlib from [zlib.net](http://www.zlib.net/). After downloading, you need to compile and install it. 

If you're not comfortable with compiling and installing zlib manually, you might want to consider using a Python distribution like Anaconda which comes with these dependencies pre-installed.
