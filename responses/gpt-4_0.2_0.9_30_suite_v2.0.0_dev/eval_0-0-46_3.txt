The error message you're seeing is because ESLint is trying to read the `tsconfig.json` file from the root directory of your project, but it's not finding it there.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the `project` option under `parserOptions` as `tsconfig.json`, which means ESLint will look for this file in the root directory of your project.

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the root directory, you need to provide the correct relative path from the root directory to the `tsconfig.json` file.

For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is inside a `config` directory in the root of your project, you would change the `project` option to `"config/tsconfig.json"`:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "config/tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory and you're still seeing this error, it could be a problem with your ESLint setup. Make sure you have the correct versions of ESLint and the TypeScript ESLint parser installed in your project.

If none of the above solutions work, you can try deleting your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file (if you have one), and then running `npm install` to reinstall your dependencies. This can sometimes fix issues caused by dependency conflicts or corrupted installations.
