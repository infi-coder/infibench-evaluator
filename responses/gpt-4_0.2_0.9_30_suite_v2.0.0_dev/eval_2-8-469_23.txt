The error message indicates that `protoc-gen-go` is unable to determine the Go import path for your `simple.proto` file. You can resolve this by specifying a `go_package` option in your .proto source file.

Here's how you can modify your `simple.proto` file:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "github.com/yourusername/yourrepository"; // replace with your package's import path

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

The `go_package` option should be the Go import path where you want the generated Go code to be placed. In this case, replace `"github.com/yourusername/yourrepository"` with the actual path where you want the generated Go code to be placed.

After modifying your `simple.proto` file, you can run the `protoc` command again:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. simple.proto
```

This should now generate the Go code without any errors.
