This error usually occurs when the SwiftUI Preview can't find the target to which the file belongs. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check File's Target Membership**: In Xcode, select the file that contains your `ContentView_Previews` struct. In the File Inspector on the right, under "Target Membership", make sure your app's target is checked.

2. **Clean Build Folder**: Sometimes, Xcode gets confused with old build artifacts. You can clean the build folder by going to `Product > Clean Build Folder` or using the shortcut `Shift + Command + K`.

3. **Restart Xcode**: Sometimes, simply restarting Xcode can solve the problem.

4. **Update Xcode**: If you're not on the latest version of Xcode, consider updating. Apple frequently fixes bugs in new releases.

5. **Recreate the SwiftUI View**: If all else fails, try recreating the SwiftUI view file. This can sometimes fix issues with the file's metadata that might be causing the problem.

Remember to rebuild your project after each step to check if the problem is solved.
