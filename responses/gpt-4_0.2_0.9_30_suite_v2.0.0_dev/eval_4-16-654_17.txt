You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by using the `ssh-add` command. 

First, you need to start the ssh-agent in the background:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Then, you can add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```bash
ssh-add /d/keys/your_key
```

Replace `your_key` with the name of your private key file.

Please note that Git Bash needs to be able to find `ssh-add`. If it can't, you might need to add the directory containing `ssh-add` to your PATH environment variable. 

Also, the key should be in OpenSSH format. If it's not, you can convert it using PuTTYgen:

1. Open PuTTYgen.
2. Click `Load` to load your existing private key file.
3. Once the key is loaded, select `Conversions` from the menu, then `Export OpenSSH key`.
4. Save the new OpenSSH key when prompted.
