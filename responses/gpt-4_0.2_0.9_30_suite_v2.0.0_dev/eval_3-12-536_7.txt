You can use `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton` and `TextButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property. 

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with border-radius in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20), // radius of 20
    ),
  ),
  onPressed: () { /* Your code here */ },
  child: Text('Button'),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton.styleFrom` is used to create a mutable style with a rounded rectangle border. The `shape` property is set to a `RoundedRectangleBorder` with a border radius of 20. The `onPressed` function is where you put the code that will be executed when the button is pressed. The `child` property is used to set the content of the button, in this case, a text widget with the string 'Button'.
