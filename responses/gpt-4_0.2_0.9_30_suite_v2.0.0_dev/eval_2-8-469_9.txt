The error message is indicating that the `go_package` option is missing in your proto file. This option is used to specify the full Go package import path. 

You can fix this by adding the `go_package` option to your proto file. Here is an example:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "github.com/yourusername/your-repo/your-package";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

In the `go_package` option, replace `"github.com/yourusername/your-repo/your-package"` with the actual Go import path where the generated Go code will be placed.

After you've added the `go_package` option, you should be able to generate the Go code with the `protoc` command you've been using:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. simple.proto
```
