Use `WillPopScope` instead of `Navigator.pop(context)` or `Navigator.of(context).pop()`. 

`WillPopScope` is a widget in Flutter that detects when the user has pressed the back button on their device and calls a function that you provide. You can use this function to control whether the app should be popped.

Here is an example of how you can use it:

```dart
return WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () async => false, // prevent the page from being popped
  child: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('Login Page'),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: Text('Login Page'),
    ),
  ),
);
```

In this example, the `onWillPop` function returns `false`, which means the page will not be popped when the user presses the back button.
