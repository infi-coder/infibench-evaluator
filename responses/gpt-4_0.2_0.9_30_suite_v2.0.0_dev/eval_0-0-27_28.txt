The code you provided seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you might want to check:

1. **Network Connection:** Make sure your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. Sometimes, the emulator might not be connected to the internet, causing the request to hang indefinitely.

2. **Server Availability:** The server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' might be down or not responding. You can check this by visiting the URL in your web browser or using a tool like Postman to send a request.

3. **Apollo Client Version:** There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to an older version to see if that resolves the issue.

4. **React Native Version:** There might be compatibility issues with the version of React Native you're using. Try downgrading to an older version to see if that resolves the issue.

5. **Error Handling:** The `error` object returned by `useQuery` might not be a string, so it might not be logged correctly. Try logging `JSON.stringify(error)` to see if there's an error message that's not being displayed.

6. **Apollo Client Setup:** There might be an issue with how Apollo Client is set up. Make sure you're following the official Apollo Client documentation closely.

If none of these suggestions work, it might be helpful to create a minimal reproduction of the issue on a platform like CodeSandbox or Expo Snack. This will allow others to run your code and potentially spot the issue.
