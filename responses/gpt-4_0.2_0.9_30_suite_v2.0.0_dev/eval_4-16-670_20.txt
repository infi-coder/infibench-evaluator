Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a traditional RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` tool. Here's how you can do it:

1. Convert OpenSSH private key to RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for the passphrase (if any) of the key. After entering the passphrase, it will write the RSA private key out to the same file `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. The `-p` option tells `ssh-keygen` to change the passphrase of a private key file, `-m PEM` tells it to use the older PEM format instead of the new OpenSSH format, and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file of the private key.

2. You don't need to convert the public key. The public key file `id_rsa.pub` is compatible with both OpenSSH and RSA formats. The public key doesn't have a header like the private key, so you don't need to worry about it.

Please remember to replace `~/.ssh/id_rsa` with the actual path of your private key if it's located somewhere else.
