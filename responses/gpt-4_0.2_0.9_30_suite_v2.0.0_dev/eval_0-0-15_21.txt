Sure, the issue is that you're returning an object instead of a function that returns an object. When you use `new API()`, JavaScript expects `API` to be a constructor function, but in your mock, it's an object. Here's how you can revise your code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  // Returns a function
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this revised code, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` returns a mock function that can be used as a constructor. When you call `new API()`, it will return the object `{someMethod: () => {}}`.
