The error message is indicating that starting from Android 12 (API level 31), you need to specify either `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` or `FLAG_MUTABLE` when creating a `PendingIntent`.

The issue you're facing is a known issue with the `MediaSessionCompat` class in the AndroidX Media library. The library is trying to create a `PendingIntent` without specifying either `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` or `FLAG_MUTABLE`, which is not allowed in Android 12 and above.

This issue has been fixed in the AndroidX Media library version 1.4.3. So, you should update your dependency to use this version or a later one.

In your `build.gradle` file, update the version of the AndroidX Media library:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // other dependencies...

    implementation 'androidx.media:media:1.4.3'
}
```

After updating the library, clean and rebuild your project. If you're still facing the issue, please let me know.
