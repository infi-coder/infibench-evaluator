Sure, the issue is that you are returning an object instead of a constructor function from your mock. Here is the revised version of your code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this revised version, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` returns a mock function that can be used as a constructor. When this mock function is called with the `new` keyword, it will return the object `{someMethod: () => {}}`.
