Your code seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you can check if you're experiencing issues:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. Apollo Client fetches data over the network, so a lack of connectivity could cause the query to hang indefinitely.

2. **Server Status**: Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can do this by visiting the URL in a web browser or using a tool like Postman to send a request.

3. **GraphQL Query**: Verify that your GraphQL query is correct. You can test your query directly on the GraphQL server if it provides a playground (like GraphiQL). The URL 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' does provide a playground where you can test your queries.

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (like 3.3.7) to see if the problem persists.

5. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, there might be an issue with the network inspect. Try disabling it and see if the problem persists.

6. **Error Handling**: You might be missing some error information. Try logging the error object to see if it contains any useful information:

```javascript
if (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
}
```

7. **Apollo Client Setup**: Ensure that the Apollo Client is set up correctly. The `uri` should point to your GraphQL server, and the `cache` should be an instance of `InMemoryCache`.

If none of these suggestions help, please provide more context or any error messages you're seeing, and I'll be glad to assist further.
