You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here is how you can do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, those changes will be applied to your current terminal session.

If you're using a different shell, like zsh (which is the default in macOS Catalina and later), you'll need to source the appropriate configuration file, like `.zshrc`:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

This is equivalent to using the `.` command:

```bash
. ~/.bash_profile
```

or

```bash
. ~/.zshrc
```

These commands will not restart your terminal, but they will apply the changes you made to your shell configuration.
