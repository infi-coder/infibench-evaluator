The comment is partially correct. 

A constructor is indeed not a regular function. It is a special method in a class in object-oriented programming. However, it's not entirely accurate to say that a constructor "cannot be called". 

In many programming languages like JavaScript, Java, C++, etc., a constructor is automatically called when an instance of a class (i.e., an object) is created. This is the primary role of a constructor. 

However, in some circumstances and depending on the language, you can also manually call a constructor. For example, in JavaScript, you can use the `call` or `apply` methods to call a constructor on an object.

So, while the comment is correct in the sense that constructors are automatically invoked during object creation, it's not entirely accurate to say they "cannot be called" in any context.
