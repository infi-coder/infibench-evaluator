The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It's part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

This attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using a version prior to 5.0, you won't have access to this attribute.

To use the `[Keyless]` attribute, you need to:

1. Update your Entity Framework Core to version 5.0 or later.
2. Add the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace to your file.

Here's an example of how to use it:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    // Other properties...
}
```

Then in your `DbContext`:

```csharp
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

And you can use it as you mentioned:

```csharp
_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)
```

Remember that keyless entities are never tracked for changes in the DbContext and therefore cannot be inserted, updated or deleted on the database. They are useful for read-only scenarios such as executing a stored procedure that returns a result set.
