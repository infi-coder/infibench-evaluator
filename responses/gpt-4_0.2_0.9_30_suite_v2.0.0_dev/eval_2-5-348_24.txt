This issue is related to the way Java handles quotes in arguments for the ProcessBuilder and Runtime.exec methods. It's a known issue that has been reported to the Java bug tracker.

Here's a workaround that you can try:

1. Open the `netbeans.conf` file in a text editor. The file is located in the `etc` directory of your NetBeans installation folder.

2. Find the `netbeans_default_options` line.

3. Add `-J-Djdk.lang.Process.allowAmbiguousCommands=true` to the list of options. Make sure to separate it from the other options with a space.

The line should look something like this:

```markdown
netbeans_default_options="-J-client -J-Xss2m -J-Xms32m -J-XX:PermSize=32m -J-Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true -J-Dapple.awt.graphics.UseQuartz=true -J-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true -J-Djdk.lang.Process.allowAmbiguousCommands=true"
```

4. Save the file and restart NetBeans.

This option tells Java to use the old way of handling command line arguments, which allows arguments with embedded quotes.

Please note that this is a workaround and not a permanent solution. The issue is caused by a bug in Java, and it's up to the Java developers to fix it.
