You need to conform `RedView` to `ShapeStyle` instead of `View`. Here is how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        Color.red._apply(to: &shape)
    }
}
```

In this code, `RedShapeStyle` conforms to `ShapeStyle` and applies the red color to the shape.
