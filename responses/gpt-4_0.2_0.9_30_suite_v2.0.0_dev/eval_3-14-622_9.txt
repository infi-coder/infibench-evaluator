To conform to `ShapeStyle` in SwiftUI, you need to create a struct that conforms to `ShapeStyle` protocol. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        shape.fill(Color.red)
    }
}
```

In the above code, `RedShapeStyle` is a struct that conforms to `ShapeStyle`. The `_apply(to:)` method is used to apply the style to the shape. In this case, it fills the shape with red color.
