The issue you're facing is due to the single quotes around the `$searchT` variable. In bash, single quotes preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes, meaning your variable isn't being expanded to its value. 

You should use double quotes instead. Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

This script will read a search term from the user, then search for that term in `test.txt`. If it finds the term, it will print the number of matches and the matches themselves. If it doesn't find the term, it will print "no match found".
