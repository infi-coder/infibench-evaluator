The error message indicates that the zlib library, which is a required dependency for Pillow, could not be found. This is likely because you are trying to install Pillow from source, which requires certain dependencies to be installed on your system.

However, as of Pillow version 6.2.0, Python 3.8 is supported and prebuilt Windows binaries are provided, so you should not need to build from source.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Upgrade pip to the latest version:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

2. Uninstall the current Pillow version:

    ```bash
    pip uninstall pillow
    ```

3. Install Pillow again:

    ```bash
    pip install pillow
    ```

This should install the latest version of Pillow, which supports Python 3.8 and provides prebuilt Windows binaries.

If you still encounter issues, it's possible that your Python environment is not correctly configured. You might want to consider using a virtual environment to isolate your Python environment for each project. This can help to avoid conflicts between different versions of packages. You can create a virtual environment with the following command:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

Then, to activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

    ```bash
    myenv\Scripts\activate
    ```

- On Unix or MacOS:

    ```bash
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```

After activating the virtual environment, try installing Pillow again.
