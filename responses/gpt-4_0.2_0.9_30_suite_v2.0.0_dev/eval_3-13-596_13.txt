Yes, you can disallow Gradle to generate the `*.plain.jar` file. This can be achieved by disabling the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file. 

Here is how you can do it:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will prevent the generation of the `*-plain.jar` file. However, please note that this will also disable the generation of the executable jar file. If you still want to generate the executable jar file, you can use the `jar` task instead:

```groovy
jar {
    enabled = true
    archiveBaseName = 'myprogram'
    archiveVersion =  '0.0.1'
}
```

This will generate the `myprogram-0.0.1.jar` file.
