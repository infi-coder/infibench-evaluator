The error message you're seeing indicates that Go is unable to find the specified version of the module in the repository. This could be due to a number of reasons, including network issues, incorrect configuration, or access control.

Here are a few steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. **Check your network connection**: Ensure that you have a stable internet connection and that you're able to access the repository URL in a web browser.

2. **Verify the module version**: Make sure that the version `v0.1.5` of the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` actually exists in the repository. You can do this by visiting the repository URL and checking the list of tags or releases.

3. **Check your access permissions**: Even though you have access to the domain, you might not have access to the specific repository. Try cloning the repository manually using `git clone` to see if you encounter any permission issues.

4. **Check your Go configuration**: Go uses the `GOPROXY` environment variable to determine where to download modules from. If this is set to `direct`, Go will download modules directly from their source repositories. If it's set to a URL, Go will download modules from that proxy. Check the value of this variable using `go env` and make sure it's set correctly.

5. **Try updating your dependencies**: Run `go get -u` to update all your dependencies to their latest minor or patch versions. This might fix the issue if the problem is due to a bug in a specific version of a dependency.

6. **Clear your module cache**: Run `go clean -modcache` to remove all downloaded modules from your cache. This will force Go to re-download all your dependencies the next time you build your program.

If none of these steps work, you might want to consider asking for help on a Go forum or issue tracker. Be sure to include all relevant information, including the exact error message you're seeing, the contents of your `go.mod` and `go.sum` files, and any steps you've taken to debug the issue.
