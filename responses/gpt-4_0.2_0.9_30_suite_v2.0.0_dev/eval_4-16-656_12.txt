The `Get-Service` cmdlet in PowerShell does not provide the detailed description of a service. It only provides basic properties like Status, Name, DisplayName, etc.

If you want to get the detailed description of a service, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet with the `Win32_Service` WMI class. Here's an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service" | Select-Object Name, Description | Out-GridView
```

This command will get all services and their descriptions and display them in a grid view.

If you want to get the description of a specific service, you can modify the query. For example, to get the description of the "wuauserv" service (Windows Update service), you can use:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service Where Name = 'wuauserv'" | Select-Object Name, Description
```

This will display the name and description of the "wuauserv" service.
