The error message you're seeing indicates that the response from your API call is not valid JSON. The '<' character is not a valid start of a JSON value, which suggests that the response might be HTML or XML instead of JSON.

The issue might be related to the route of your API. In your `EmployeeController`, you have defined the route as `api/Employee/Index`:

```csharp
[HttpGet]
[Route("api/Employee/Index")]
public IEnumerable<Employee> Index()
{
    return objemployee.GetAllEmployees();
}
```

However, in your controller attribute, you have also defined a route:

```csharp
[Route("[controller]")]
public class EmployeeController : ControllerBase
```

This might result in a conflict or confusion about the correct route. 

Try changing your `HttpGet` attribute to just `[HttpGet]` and make sure your `Route` attribute in the `EmployeeController` is `[Route("api/[controller]")]`. The final code should look like this:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class EmployeeController : ControllerBase
{
    EmployeeRepository objemployee = new EmployeeRepository();

    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Employee> Index()
    {
        return objemployee.GetAllEmployees();
    }
}
```

Then, in your Blazor component, you should be able to call the API with the following code:

```csharp
empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("api/Employee");
```

This should resolve the issue if it was caused by a routing problem. If the problem persists, it might be due to the data returned by `GetAllEmployees()` not being serializable to JSON, or the server might be configured to return XML instead of JSON. In that case, you would need to check the implementation of `GetAllEmployees()` and your server configuration.
