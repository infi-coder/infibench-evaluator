It seems like you're facing a version conflict issue. The `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations are part of the Bean Validation 2.0 specification, which is implemented by Hibernate Validator 6.0.0.Final and later. 

However, the log shows that Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2 is being used, which only supports Bean Validation 1.1. This version of Hibernate Validator doesn't recognize the `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations, hence the error.

The version of Hibernate Validator being used is likely coming from JBoss, which has its own bundled version of Hibernate Validator. 

To resolve this, you can try one of the following:

1. **Upgrade your JBoss version to one that includes Hibernate Validator 6.0.0.Final or later.** This is the simplest solution if it's feasible for you.

2. **Exclude the Hibernate Validator from JBoss and include it in your application.** This is a bit more complex and may have other implications, but it would allow you to use the version of Hibernate Validator that you want. Here's how you can do it:

    Add this to your `jboss-deployment-structure.xml`:

    ```xml
    <jboss-deployment-structure>
        <deployment>
            <exclusions>
                <module name="org.hibernate.validator" />
            </exclusions>
        </deployment>
    </jboss-deployment-structure>
    ```

    And add this to your `pom.xml`:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
        <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
        <artifactId>hibernate-validator-annotation-processor</artifactId>
        <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

3. **Use the older `@NotNull` and `@Size(min=1)` annotations instead of `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank`.** This would work with the older version of Hibernate Validator, but it's not as clean or intuitive.
