The issue you're facing is likely due to the fact that Vite's server is binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) inside the Docker container by default. This means it's not accessible from outside the container, even though the port is exposed.

To fix this, you need to configure Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0` so it's accessible from outside the Docker container. You can do this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file like so:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server from your host machine at `localhost:8080`.
