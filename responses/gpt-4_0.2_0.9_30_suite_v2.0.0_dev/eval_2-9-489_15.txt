The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled in your current setup. Without these security features, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

Here are the steps to enable Elasticsearch security features:

1. Open your `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. The location of this file depends on how you installed Elasticsearch. If you used Homebrew, it's likely in `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/`.

2. Add the following lines to the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yml
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

If you're using a version of Elasticsearch prior to 6.8.0, you'll also need to add the following lines to the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yml
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true
xpack.ssl.key: /path/to/your/server.key
xpack.ssl.certificate: /path/to/your/server.crt
```

Replace `/path/to/your/server.key` and `/path/to/your/server.crt` with the actual paths to your SSL key and certificate files.

After making these changes, you should no longer see the warning message about Elasticsearch security features not being enabled.

Please note that enabling security features will require you to set up user authentication for Elasticsearch. You can follow the instructions in the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html) to set up a minimal security configuration.

If you don't want to enable security features, you can suppress the warning by adding the following line to your `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yml
xpack.security.enabled: false
```

This will disable Elasticsearch's built-in security features and suppress the warning message. However, it's generally recommended to enable security features if you're running Elasticsearch in a production environment.
