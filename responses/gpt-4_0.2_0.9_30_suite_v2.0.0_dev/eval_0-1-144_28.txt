You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This pseudo-element is used by Bootstrap to create the arrow. Here's how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may want to include !important to override Bootstrap's styles */
    color: green !important; 
}
```

This CSS rule changes the color of the accordion arrow to green. The `!important` rule is used to override any existing styles that might be applied to the accordion arrow by Bootstrap.

Please note that this will change the color of all accordion arrows in your project. If you want to change the color of a specific accordion arrow, you should add a custom class to that specific accordion button and then target that class in your CSS.

For example:

```html
<button class="accordion-button custom-accordion" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne" style="background-color: red;border:0">
    name and surname
</button>
```

And in your CSS:

```css
.custom-accordion::after {
    color: green !important; 
}
```
