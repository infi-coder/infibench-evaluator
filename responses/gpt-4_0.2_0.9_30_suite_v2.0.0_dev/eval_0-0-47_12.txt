Sure, you can define an inline type for the objects in the array like this:

```typescript
bagTotal = (products: {name: string, price: number, description: string}[]) => {
 // function does stuff
}
```

In this case, `products` is an array of objects, each object having `name` as a string, `price` as a number, and `description` as a string.
