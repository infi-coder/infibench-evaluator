Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` tool. Here's how you can do it:

1. Convert OpenSSH private key to RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for the passphrase (if any). After entering the passphrase, the key will be re-written in place in the RSA format. The `-p` option tells `ssh-keygen` to change the passphrase of a private key file, `-m PEM` tells it to write the key in the older PEM format, and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file to convert.

2. Regarding the public key (`id_rsa.pub`), you don't need to convert it. The public key format is standard and should be accepted by the server regardless of whether the private key is in OpenSSH or RSA format. However, if you want to regenerate the public key from the private key, you can use the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

This command will overwrite the existing public key with the new one generated from the private key. The `-y` option tells `ssh-keygen` to read a private key file and print an OpenSSH compatible public key to stdout, and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the private key file to read. The `> ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` part redirects the output to the `id_rsa.pub` file.
