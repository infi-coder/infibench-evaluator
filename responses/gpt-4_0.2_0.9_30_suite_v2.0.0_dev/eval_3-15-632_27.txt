Assuming that the line you're trying to split is a string with values separated by spaces (or any other delimiter), you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the string into an array and then assign the array elements to the cells. Here's how you can do it:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitText As Variant
    splitText = Split(textline, " ") 'Assuming space is the delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitText(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitText(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitText(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitText(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitText(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This will split the line into 5 parts and put each part into a separate cell in the same row. Adjust the indices of `splitText` and the column letters as per your requirements.
