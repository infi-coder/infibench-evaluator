The Springdoc OpenAPI UI path has changed in recent versions. The new URL to access the Swagger UI is:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

or

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/
```

You can also customize the path by adding the following property to your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui.html
```

This will set the Swagger UI path back to `/swagger-ui.html`.

Also, make sure that you have the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
    <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-ui</artifactId>
    <version>1.6.11</version>
</dependency>
```

And don't forget to enable the Swagger UI in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=true
```

If you're using Spring Security, you might also need to permit all access to the Swagger UI path in your security configuration. For example:

```java
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/swagger-ui/**").permitAll()
            .anyRequest().authenticated();
    }
}
```

This configuration allows unauthenticated access to the Swagger UI while requiring authentication for all other paths.
