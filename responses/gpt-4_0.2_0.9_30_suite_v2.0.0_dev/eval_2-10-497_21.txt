In Rust, you don't have null pointers like in C or C++. Instead, you have the `Option` type which can be `Some` or `None`. `None` is used to represent the absence of a value, similar to a null pointer in other languages.

You can use `Option<Box<Node>>` to represent a nullable pointer to a `Node`. Here's how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

Now, you can check if the `top` of the stack is `None` (similar to null) like this:

```rust
if let Some(node) = &stack.top {
    // The top of the stack is not null, do something with node
} else {
    // The top of the stack is null
}
```

Or you can use `is_none()` or `is_some()` methods:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    // The top of the stack is null
} else {
    // The top of the stack is not null
}
```

Remember, in Rust, you don't have to (and can't) manually deallocate memory. When `Box<Node>` goes out of scope, its destructor is called and the memory is freed.
