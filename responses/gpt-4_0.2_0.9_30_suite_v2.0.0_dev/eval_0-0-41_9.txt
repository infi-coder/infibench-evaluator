The issue with your code is that you're checking if the `navigator.geolocation` API is available, but not whether the user has granted permission to access their location. The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` method is asynchronous and takes a second argument, which is a function that will be called if an error occurs.

Here is the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            if (error.code == error.PERMISSION_DENIED)
                console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the user denies permission to access their location, the error function will be called and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console. If the `navigator.geolocation` API is not available at all, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged.
