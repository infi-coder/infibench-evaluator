Yes, Flutter provides a widget called `VerticalDivider` to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here is a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 2'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 3'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, `VerticalDivider` is used to draw vertical lines between three text widgets. You can customize the color, thickness, and width of the divider. The `Expanded` widget is used to give equal space to each child in the `Row`.
