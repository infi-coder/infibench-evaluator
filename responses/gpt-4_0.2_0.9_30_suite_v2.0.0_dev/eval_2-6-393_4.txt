The problem is that you're trying to create an index on a navigation property `Gender`. EF Core doesn't support this. Instead, you should create an index on the foreign key property `GenderId`.

Here's how you should modify your `OnModelCreating` method:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);` creates an index on the `GenderId` column in the `User` table. This can improve the performance of queries that filter or sort by `GenderId`.
