The error message indicates that Go is unable to find the specific revision of the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` in your private repository. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Access rights**: Even though you have access to the private repository, Go might not. Make sure that your Go environment is properly configured to access private repositories. If you are using `go get`, you might need to configure Git to use SSH instead of HTTPS.

2. **The specific revision does not exist**: The error message indicates that Go is unable to find the specific revision `v0.1.5`. Make sure that this revision actually exists in your private repository.

3. **Network issues**: There might be network issues preventing Go from accessing the private repository. Try accessing the repository manually from the same network to rule out this possibility.

To debug this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. **Check the specific revision**: Make sure that the specific revision `v0.1.5` actually exists in your private repository.

2. **Check your Go environment**: Make sure that your Go environment is properly configured to access private repositories. You can do this by running `go env` and checking the output.

3. **Try to manually clone the repository**: Try to manually clone the repository using Git. This can help you determine if the issue is with Go or with your access to the repository.

4. **Check your network**: If you are able to clone the repository manually, but Go is still unable to access it, there might be network issues. Try accessing the repository from a different network to rule out this possibility.

5. **Use verbose mode**: You can use the `-v` flag with `go get` to get more detailed output. This might help you identify the issue.

Here is an example of how to use the `-v` flag:

```bash
go get -v github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
```

This will give you more detailed output about what `go get` is doing, which might help you identify the issue.
