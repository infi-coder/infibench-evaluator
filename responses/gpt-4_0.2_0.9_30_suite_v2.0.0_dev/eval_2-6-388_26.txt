The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It's actually part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

This attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you're using an older version of EF Core, you won't have access to this attribute.

To use the `[Keyless]` attribute, you need to:

1. Ensure you're using EF Core 5.0 or later.
2. Add a reference to the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace in your file.

Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    // other properties...
}
```

And then in your `DbContext`:

```csharp
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

Now you should be able to use the `FromSqlRaw(...)` method without needing to add a primary key to your model.
