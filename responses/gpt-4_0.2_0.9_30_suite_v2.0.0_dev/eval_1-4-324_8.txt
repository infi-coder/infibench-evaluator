Here is a function `mySplit` that uses the `strsplit` function to split the strings in the column `col1` of your dataframe `df` by comma and colon, and then reassembles the split strings into a new dataframe:

```r
mySplit <- function(df) {
  # Split the strings in col1 by comma
  split_comma <- strsplit(df$col1, ",")
  
  # Initialize empty vectors to store the split strings
  name <- vector()
  age <- vector()
  city <- vector()
  
  # Loop over the split strings
  for (i in 1:length(split_comma)) {
    # Split each string by colon
    split_colon <- strsplit(split_comma[[i]], ":")
    
    # Store the split strings in the appropriate vectors
    name <- c(name, split_colon[[1]][2])
    age <- c(age, split_colon[[2]][2])
    city <- c(city, split_colon[[3]][2])
  }
  
  # Create a new dataframe from the vectors
  new_df <- data.frame(name = name, Age = age, City = city)
  
  return(new_df)
}
```

Please note that this function assumes that the strings in `col1` always follow the format "name:Name,Age:Age,City:City". If the format can vary, you may need to modify the function to handle the variations.
