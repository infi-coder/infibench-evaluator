You can use the `openpyxl` library to write data into an Excel file. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install openpyxl
```

Here is the function `writeToExcel`:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

    # Create a workbook and select the active worksheet
    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active

    # Write the data to the worksheet
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
            ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

    # Save the workbook
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new Excel workbook, writes the data from `new_list` into the active worksheet, and then saves the workbook as "data.xlsx". The `ws.cell` method is used to write data to a specific cell, and it takes the row number, column number, and the value to be written as arguments. Note that row and column numbers in Excel start from 1, not 0.
