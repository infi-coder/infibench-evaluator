You can use the `now()` function provided by Laravel to get the current date and time. This function will return the current date and time in a format that MySQL can understand. Here is how you can modify your function to use the `now()` function:

```php
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array(
        "name" => $name, 
        "address" => $address, 
        "created_at" => now(), 
        "updated_at" => now()
    );
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

This will store the current date and time in the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields in the database.
