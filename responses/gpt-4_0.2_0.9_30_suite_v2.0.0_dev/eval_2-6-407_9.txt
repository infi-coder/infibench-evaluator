The error message you're seeing indicates that the response from your API call is not valid JSON. The '<' character is not a valid start of a JSON value, which suggests that the response might be HTML or XML instead.

The issue might be due to the route of your API method. In your `EmployeeController`, you've specified the route as `[Route("api/Employee/Index")]`, but in the controller's declaration, you've also specified `[Route("[controller]")]`. This means that the actual route to your method might be `/Employee/api/Employee/Index` instead of `/api/Employee/Index`.

Try changing your `EmployeeController` to this:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class EmployeeController : ControllerBase
{
    EmployeeRepository objemployee = new EmployeeRepository();

    [HttpGet]
    [Route("Index")]
    public IEnumerable<Employee> Index()
    {
        return objemployee.GetAllEmployees();
    }
}
```

And then in your Blazor code, you can call the API like this:

```csharp
empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("api/Employee/Index");
```

If the issue persists, you might want to check what the API is actually returning. You can do this by calling the API from a tool like Postman or curl, or by logging the response in your Blazor code before trying to parse it as JSON.

Also, please note that the `GetJsonAsync` method is obsolete in .NET 5.0 and later. If you're using .NET 5.0 or later, you should use `GetFromJsonAsync` instead:

```csharp
empList = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<Employee[]>("api/Employee/Index");
```
