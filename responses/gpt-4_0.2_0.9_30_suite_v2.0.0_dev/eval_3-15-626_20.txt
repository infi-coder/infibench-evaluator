Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. You're trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you haven't declared them. In VBA, you need to declare variables with `Dim` before you use them.

2. You're trying to use `query` as a `WorkbookQuery` object, but you're assigning it a string value. You need to create a `WorkbookQuery` object and assign it to `query`.

3. You're trying to use `query.Name` in your connection string and SQL command text, but `query` is a string, not a `WorkbookQuery` object. You need to use the name of the query, not the query text.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As String

    ' Get the query text from Sheet6
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Get the name of the active sheet
    currentSheet = ActiveSheet.Name

    ' Create a new ListObject and QueryTable
    With ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code assumes that the text in cell A1 of Sheet6 is the name of a Power Query query in the workbook. If it's actually the SQL command text for the query, you'll need to create a `WorkbookQuery` object with that command text and use its name in your connection string and SQL command text
