You can use the `pkg_resources` module to get the installed version of a package, and the `yolk3k` package to get the latest version available on PyPI. Here's how you can do it:

First, you need to install `yolk3k` package. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install yolk3k
```

Then, you can use the following function:

```python
import pkg_resources
from yolk.pypi import CheeseShop

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the latest version from PyPI
    pypi = CheeseShop()
    versions = pypi.package_releases(pkgName)
    if not versions:  # No versions found on PyPI
        return False
    latest_version = versions[0]

    # Get the installed version
    try:
        installed_version = pkg_resources.get_distribution(pkgName).version
    except pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:  # Package is not installed
        return False

    # Compare the versions
    return pkg_resources.parse_version(installed_version) >= pkg_resources.parse_version(latest_version)
```

This function will return `True` if the installed version of the package is the latest version, and `False` otherwise. If the package is not installed or not found on PyPI, it will also return `False`.

Please note that this function assumes that the package is installed in the same Python environment where this script is running. If the package is installed in a different environment, you'll need to activate that environment before running this script.
