You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by using the `ssh-add` command. However, before doing that, you need to start the ssh-agent in the background.

Here are the steps:

1. Start Git Bash.
2. Start the ssh-agent in the background:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace `id_rsa` in the command with the name of your private key file.

```bash
ssh-add D:/keys/id_rsa
```

Replace `id_rsa` with your private key file name.

Please note that `ssh-add` command might not work if your key is in the PuTTY's `.ppk` format. Git Bash's `ssh-add` command expects the key to be in the OpenSSH format. If your key is in `.ppk` format, you need to convert it to OpenSSH format using PuTTYgen before adding it to the ssh-agent.
