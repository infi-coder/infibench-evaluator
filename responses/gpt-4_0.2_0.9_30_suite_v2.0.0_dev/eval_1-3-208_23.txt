Sure, I can help with that. The problem with your code is that you're checking if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, not if each individual character is in the `correct` string. Here's how you can modify your function to check each character:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = set(string.ascii_letters + string.digits)
    return all(char in correct for char in text)
```

This function works by first creating a set of all the correct characters. Then, it uses the `all` function to check if every character in the `text` string is in the `correct` set. If any character is not in the `correct` set, `all` will return `False`. If all characters are in the `correct` set, `all` will return `True`.

Here's how you can use this function:

```python
text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

This will print "Success" if all characters in the input string are either a letter or a digit, and "Failure" otherwise.
