The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are the steps you should follow to solve this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    php -v
    ```
    If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, and XML. You can check your installed extensions by running:

    ```bash
    php -m
    ```
    If any of the required extensions are missing, you need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Although you've updated Composer to 2.3.10, it's always good to double-check. Run the following command to check your Composer version:

    ```bash
    composer --version
    ```
    If your Composer version is not up-to-date, you need to update it.

4. **Clear Composer cache**: Sometimes, the Composer cache can cause problems. You can clear it by running:

    ```bash
    composer clear-cache
    ```
    After clearing the cache, try to create the Laravel project again.

If you've checked all these points and you're still having problems, it's possible that Laravel 9 has not been officially released yet. At the time of writing this response, the latest stable version of Laravel is 8.65.0. You can check the latest version of Laravel on the [Packagist website](https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/laravel).
