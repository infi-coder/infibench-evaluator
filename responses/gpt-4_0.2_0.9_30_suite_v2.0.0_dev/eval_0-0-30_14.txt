Enzyme doesn't officially support React 17 yet. However, there is an unofficial adapter available that you can use. It's called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`.

Here is how you can adapt your code:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Before you use this, you need to install the adapter. You can do this with npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Please note that since this is an unofficial adapter, it may not work perfectly or may lack some features compared to the official adapters.
