The error message you're seeing is because you're trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`). In Entity Framework, you can only create indexes on scalar properties (like `int`, `string`, `DateTime`, etc.), not on navigation properties.

If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property, you should do it like this:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In the above code, we're creating an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity, which is a foreign key to the `Gender` entity. This can help improve query performance when you're frequently filtering or sorting by this property.
