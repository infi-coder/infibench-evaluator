The error message you're seeing is due to a conflict between the Windows and WSL versions of Node.js and npm. The `whereis` command shows that there are two installations of Node.js and npm: one in `/usr/bin` (the WSL version) and one in `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs` (the Windows version).

The problem is that when you run `npm -v`, the shell is trying to execute the Windows version of npm, but it can't interpret the file because it's a Windows executable, not a Linux executable.

To resolve this issue, you need to make sure that the WSL version of npm is used instead of the Windows version. You can do this by modifying the `PATH` environment variable in your shell's configuration file (usually `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for the Bash shell).

Here's how to do it:

1. Open your shell's configuration file in a text editor. If you're using Bash, the file is usually `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`. You can open it with a command like `nano ~/.bashrc`.

2. Add the following line to the end of the file:

    ```bash
    export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
    ```

    This line prepends `/usr/bin` to the `PATH`, which means that the shell will look for executables in `/usr/bin` before it looks in any other directories listed in the `PATH`.

3. Save the file and exit the text editor.

4. Close the terminal and open a new one to make sure the changes take effect.

Now, when you run `npm -v`, the shell should use the npm executable in `/usr/bin`, which is the WSL version.
