The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. You cannot install it via Composer. The `ext-zip` extension is used to read, write and process zip archives in PHP.

To install it, you need to modify your PHP installation. Here's how you can do it:

**For Ubuntu/Debian**

1. Update package lists for upgrades for packages that need upgrading, as well as new packages that have just come to the repositories.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

2. Install the zip extension.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install php-zip
    ```

**For CentOS**

1. Install the zip extension.

    ```bash
    sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
    ```

**For Windows**

1. Open your `php.ini` file.

2. Uncomment the line that reads `;extension=php_zip.dll` by removing the semicolon at the start.

3. Save the `php.ini` file and restart your web server.

**For MacOS**

1. If you're using Homebrew, you can install the extension via PECL.

    ```bash
    brew install php@7.3
    pecl install zip
    ```

After installing the extension, you should add it to your `composer.json` file to ensure that it's required for your project:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer install` again.
