The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` cannot be found in the npm registry. This is because there is no package named `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry.

If you're trying to install the AWS SDK for JavaScript, the correct package name is `aws-sdk`. You should run:

```bash
npm install --save aws-sdk
```

This command will install the AWS SDK for JavaScript and add it to your `package.json` file. 

Remember to always check the correct package name in the npm registry before installing it.
