The issue you're experiencing might be due to a variety of reasons. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your network connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator is connected to the internet and can access the GraphQL server.

2. **Check the server URL**: Make sure the server URL you're using is correct and the server is running. You can test the server URL by pasting it into a web browser and see if it loads.

3. **Check the GraphQL query**: Ensure that your GraphQL query is correct. You can test your query using a GraphQL client like GraphQL Playground or Apollo Studio.

4. **Check for CORS issues**: If your server is on a different domain, you might be running into Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues. You can check the console in your browser's developer tools for any CORS errors.

5. **Update Apollo Client**: There might be a bug in the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try updating to the latest version.

6. **Check for error messages**: If there's an error with your query or your server, Apollo Client should return an error message. Check the `error` object returned by `useQuery` for any error messages.

7. **Check if the server supports Apollo Client**: Some GraphQL servers might not support Apollo Client out of the box. Check the server's documentation to see if it supports Apollo Client and if there are any additional steps you need to take to set it up.

8. **Try a different GraphQL client**: If none of the above steps work, you might want to try using a different GraphQL client to see if the issue is with Apollo Client or something else. You can try using `fetch` or `axios` to make a GraphQL request and see if that works.

If none of these steps work, you might want to consider reaching out to the Apollo community or the maintainers of the server you're using for help.
