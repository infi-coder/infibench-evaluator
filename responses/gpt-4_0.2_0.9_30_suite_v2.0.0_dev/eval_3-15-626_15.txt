Your code is almost correct, but there are a few issues. 

First, you're trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you haven't declared them. 

Second, you're trying to use `query` as both a string (when you assign it the value of a cell) and a `WorkbookQuery` object (when you use `query.Name`). 

Third, you're not actually creating a Power Query using VBA. You're trying to create a QueryTable from an existing Power Query. 

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Get the query from a cell
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Get the current sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Create a QueryTable with the Power Query
    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code will create a QueryTable on the active sheet, using the Power Query from the cell A1 on Sheet6. The QueryTable will be placed starting at cell A1 on the active sheet. 

Please note that automating Power Query with VBA is not officially supported by Microsoft and may not work as expected.
