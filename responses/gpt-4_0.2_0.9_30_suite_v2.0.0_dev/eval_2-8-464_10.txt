The error you're encountering is due to the fact that AWS Lambda expects a Linux executable, but you're building your Go application on a Windows machine, which produces a Windows executable.

To solve this, you need to cross-compile your Go application for Linux. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables before building your application.

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
set GOOS=linux
set GOARCH=amd64
go build -o main main.go
```

This will produce a Linux executable named `main` from your `main.go` file. You can then zip this file and upload it to AWS Lambda.

```bash
zip function.zip main
```

After this, upload `function.zip` to your AWS Lambda function. The handler should be set to `main`.

This should solve your problem. AWS Lambda should now be able to execute your Go application without any issues.
