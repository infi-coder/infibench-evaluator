This error is related to the compatibility issues between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version that comes with Spring Boot 2.7.0. 

The Maven version 3.8.5 that comes with Spring Boot 2.7.0 is not compatible with some versions of IntelliJ IDEA. This is why you are seeing the error message.

Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. **Downgrade Maven version**: You can downgrade the Maven version in your project to a version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by modifying the `pom.xml` file in your project.

2. **Upgrade IntelliJ IDEA**: You can upgrade your IntelliJ IDEA to the latest version. The latest versions of IntelliJ IDEA are usually compatible with the latest versions of Maven.

3. **Change IntelliJ IDEA's bundled Maven**: IntelliJ IDEA comes with its own bundled version of Maven. You can change this to use the Maven version in your project. To do this, go to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven`. In the `Maven home directory` field, enter the path to your Maven directory.

4. **Disable the Maven bundled in IntelliJ IDEA**: You can disable the Maven bundled in IntelliJ IDEA and use the Maven installed on your system. To do this, go to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven`. In the `Maven home directory` field, select the `Maven bundled (Maven 3)` option.

Remember to restart IntelliJ IDEA after making these changes.
