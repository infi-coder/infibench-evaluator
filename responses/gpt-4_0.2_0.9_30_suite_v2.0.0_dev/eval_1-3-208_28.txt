Sure, the problem with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, not if each character of the input string is in the `correct` string. Here is a corrected version of your code:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)
```

In this function, `all(char in correct for char in text)` checks if all characters in the input string `text` are in the `correct` string. The `all` function returns `True` if all elements in the given iterable are true. If not, it returns `False`.
