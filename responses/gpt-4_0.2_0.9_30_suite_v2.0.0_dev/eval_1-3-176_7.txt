The error message indicates that the zlib library, which is a required dependency for Pillow, could not be found on your system. 

However, the Pillow version you're trying to install (6.0.0) is not compatible with Python 3.8. The first version of Pillow that added support for Python 3.8 was 6.2.0.

You can try to install a newer version of Pillow which supports Python 3.8. Open your terminal and type:

```bash
pip install pillow==8.2.0
```

If you still encounter the same error, you might need to install the zlib library on your system. The process to do this varies depending on your operating system.

For Windows, you can download precompiled zlib binaries from [here](https://www.zlib.net/). After downloading, extract the files and add the path to the `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

If you're using a Linux-based system, you can install zlib using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
```

After installing zlib, try installing Pillow again.
