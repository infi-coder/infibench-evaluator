The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. This means that without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To resolve this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Elasticsearch configuration file (`elasticsearch.yml`). The location of this file depends on your installation. If you installed Elasticsearch with Homebrew, it's likely in `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/`.

2. Add the following lines to the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save and close the file.

4. Restart Elasticsearch. If you're using Homebrew, you can do this with `brew services restart elasticsearch`.

5. After restarting, you'll need to set up passwords for the built-in users. You can do this by running the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` command:

    ```bash
    ./bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto
    ```

    This command will generate random passwords for the built-in users. Make sure to note these down.

6. Update your application's Elasticsearch client to use these credentials. If you're using Searchkick, you can do this by setting the `url` option when initializing Searchkick:

    ```ruby
    Searchkick.client = Elasticsearch::Client.new(
      urls: [{
        host: "localhost",
        port: "9200",
        user: "elastic",
        password: "your_generated_password",
        scheme: "http"
      }]
    )
    ```

Remember to replace `"your_generated_password"` with the actual password generated by the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` command.

Please note that these steps will enable basic authentication for Elasticsearch, which is suitable for development environments. For production environments, you should consider setting up more advanced security measures, such as using an SSL/TLS certificate.
