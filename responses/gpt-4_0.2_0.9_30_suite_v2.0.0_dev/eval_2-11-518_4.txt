The Rule of Five is not outdated per se, but it is true that with the advent of smart pointers and RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) in modern C++, the need for user-defined destructors, copy/move constructors, and copy/move assignment operators has been significantly reduced.

Smart pointers, like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`, handle their own memory and automatically clean up when they go out of scope, which eliminates the need for a user-defined destructor in many cases. They also cannot be copied, only moved, which eliminates the need for a user-defined copy constructor and copy assignment operator.

However, there are still cases where you might need to define these special member functions:

1. **Performance optimization**: The compiler-generated versions of these functions perform shallow copies. If your class contains raw pointers or handles to system resources, you may need to define these functions to perform deep copies or to properly manage the resources. Also, move semantics can provide significant performance benefits by transferring resources instead of copying them.

2. **Ownership semantics**: If your class has unique ownership semantics that cannot be expressed with the standard smart pointers, you may need to define these functions.

3. **Compatibility with legacy code**: If you're working with older code that doesn't use smart pointers, you may need to define these functions.

4. **Custom behavior**: If you need custom behavior that the compiler-generated functions don't provide, you'll need to define these functions.

So while it's true that the need for these functions has been reduced, they are not completely obsolete. The Rule of Five is still a good guideline to follow when you do need to define one of these special member functions.
