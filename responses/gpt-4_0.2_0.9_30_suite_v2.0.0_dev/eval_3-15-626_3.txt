Your VBA code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. You're trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you haven't declared them. You should declare them with `Dim` keyword.

2. `query` is assigned a value from a cell, but then you're trying to use it as an object with a `Name` property. If you're storing the name of the query in the cell, you should use that name directly.

3. `currentSheet` is assigned the name of the active sheet, but then it's not used anywhere in the code.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Get the name of the query from a cell
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Get the current sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Create a new ListObject with a QueryTable that uses the Power Query
    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code assumes that the name of the Power Query is stored in cell A1 of Sheet6, and that you want to load the results of the query into Sheet "target" starting at cell A1.
