You can disable the swipe animation in ViewPager2 by using a custom `ViewPager2.PageTransformer`. Here is an example:

```kotlin
viewPager2.setPageTransformer { page, position ->
    page.translationX = -position * page.width
}
```

This will instantly switch to the new page without any animation. 

However, please note that this will also disable the swipe animation when the user swipes manually. If you want to keep the swipe animation for manual swipes, you might need to implement a more complex solution.
