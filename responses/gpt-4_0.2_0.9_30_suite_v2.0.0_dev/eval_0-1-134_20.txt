It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that provides abbreviations and shortcuts for writing HTML and CSS. 

For example, if you type `.classname` and press `Tab`, Emmet will automatically expand this into `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, it could be because:

1. Your text editor doesn't support Emmet. Emmet is supported in many popular text editors, including Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Brackets. If you're using a text editor that doesn't support Emmet, you might consider switching to one that does.

2. Emmet is not installed or enabled. If your text editor supports Emmet, make sure it's installed and enabled. The process for doing this varies depending on the text editor.

3. You're not using the correct syntax. Make sure you're typing `.classname` and then pressing `Tab`. If you're doing something different, it might not work.

If you're still having trouble, I'd recommend checking the documentation for your text editor to see how to install and use Emmet.
