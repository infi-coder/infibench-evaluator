Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. It doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would do in traditional CSS with `div.section > div`. 

Tailwind CSS is more about adding classes directly to the HTML elements you want to style. So, you would add your utility classes to the child `div` elements directly.

For example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white">...</div>
  <div class="p-4">...</div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-blue-500` applies a blue background and `text-white` applies white text color to the first child div. `p-4` applies padding to the second child div.

If you need to apply styles to direct children elements based on their parent, you might need to use traditional CSS or preprocessors like Sass, Less, etc. along with Tailwind CSS.
