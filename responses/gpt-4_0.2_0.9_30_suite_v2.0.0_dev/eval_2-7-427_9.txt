For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Make sure that your domain is correctly configured to use HTTPS. If your application is served over HTTPS but your domain is not configured to use HTTPS, the browser may block the cookies.

2. **Session Configuration**: Check your session configuration in `config/session.php`. Make sure that the `domain` and `secure` options are correctly set. The `domain` option should be set to your domain, and the `secure` option should be set to `true` if you are using HTTPS.

3. **Cookie Configuration**: Check your cookie configuration in `config/session.php`. Make sure that the `same_site` option is correctly set. If your application is served over HTTPS, this option should be set to `lax` or `strict`.

4. **Middleware**: Make sure that the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is included in the `web` middleware group in your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

For the second issue, the error message suggests that there is a problem with the SSL configuration of your SMTP server. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **SSL Version**: The error message suggests that the SSL version used by your application does not match the SSL version used by your SMTP server. You could try changing the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` option in your `.env` file to `tls`.

2. **SMTP Server Configuration**: Check the configuration of your SMTP server. Make sure that it is correctly configured to use SSL and that the SSL certificate is valid.

3. **Firewall Settings**: Check your firewall settings. Make sure that your application is allowed to connect to your SMTP server.

4. **Port Number**: Check the port number used by your SMTP server. The default port for SSL is 465, and the default port for TLS is 587. Make sure that the `MAIL_PORT` option in your `.env` file matches the port number used by your SMTP server.
