You can use the factory pattern to create multiple instances of `ServiceBusClient` with different queue names. Here's how you can do it:

First, create a factory that will be responsible for creating `ServiceBusClient` instances:

```csharp
public interface IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    ServiceBusClient Create(string queueName);
}

public class ServiceBusClientFactory : IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    private readonly UserEventConsumerSetting _settings;

    public ServiceBusClientFactory(IOptions<UserEventConsumerSetting> options)
    {
        _settings = options.Value;
    }

    public ServiceBusClient Create(string queueName)
    {
        var client = new ServiceBusClient(_settings.ServiceBusConnectionString, new ServiceBusClientOptions
        {
            TransportType = ServiceBusTransportType.AmqpWebSockets
        });

        return client.CreateSender(queueName);
    }
}
```

Then, register this factory in your DI container:

```csharp
_services.AddSingleton<IServiceBusClientFactory, ServiceBusClientFactory>();
```

Now, you can inject `IServiceBusClientFactory` into your services and create `ServiceBusClient` instances with different queue names:

```csharp
public class CarReservationMessagingService
{
    private readonly ServiceBusSender _serviceBusSender;

    public CarReservationMessagingService(IServiceBusClientFactory factory)
    {
        _serviceBusSender = factory.Create("queueName");
    }

    // ...
}
```

This way, you can create as many `ServiceBusClient` instances as you need, each with its own queue name.
