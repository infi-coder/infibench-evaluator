The error message you're seeing is due to the `map-loop` function which is not a built-in Sass function. It seems like it's a custom function defined somewhere in your project or in the libraries you're using.

However, if you want to override the Bootstrap's default theme colors, you can do it like this:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color,
  "secondary": $gray-600,
  "success": $green,
  "info": $cyan,
  "warning": $yellow,
  "danger": $red,
  "light": $gray-100,
  "dark": $gray-800
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Replace `#your-color` with the color you want to use for the primary theme color. You can also change the other colors as per your needs.

Please note that you need to import the `functions` and `variables` files from Bootstrap before you define your `$theme-colors` map. This is because the color variables like `$gray-600`, `$green`, etc. are defined in these files.

Also, make sure to import the `bootstrap` file after you define your `$theme-colors` map. This is because the `bootstrap` file uses the `$theme-colors` map, so it needs to be defined before you import the `bootstrap` file.
