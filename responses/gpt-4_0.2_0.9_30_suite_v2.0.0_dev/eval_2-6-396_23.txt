The error message is indicating that you're trying to create an index on a navigation property, which is not allowed. In Entity Framework Core, indexes can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

So, you should remove the line where you're trying to create an index on the `Gender` navigation property:

```c#
user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);
```

Your `OnModelCreating` method should look like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property, you can do it like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

After making these changes, you should be able to add the migration without any errors.
