The error you're encountering is because you're trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`). Indexes in Entity Framework Core are used to speed up the performance of data retrieval operations on a database. They can only be created on scalar properties like `int`, `string`, `Guid`, etc., not on navigation properties.

You should create an index on `GenderId` instead of `Gender` because `GenderId` is the foreign key property in `User` entity that refers to `Gender` entity. 

Here is the corrected code:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

Now, when you run `dotnet ef add migration User`, it should work without any errors.
