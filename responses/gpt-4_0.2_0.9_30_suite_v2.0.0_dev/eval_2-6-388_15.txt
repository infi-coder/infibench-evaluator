The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It's actually part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace.

So, you need to make sure you have the correct using statement at the top of your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Also, ensure that you have the correct version of Entity Framework Core installed that supports the `[Keyless]` attribute. It was introduced in EF Core 5.0, so if you're using an older version, you won't have access to this attribute.

You can check your EF Core version by looking at the `.csproj` file in your project. You should see a line like this:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore" Version="5.0.0" />
```

If the version is lower than 5.0.0, you need to update your EF Core package. You can do this by running the following command in your Package Manager Console:

```shell
Update-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -Version 5.0.0
```

After ensuring these, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class.
