The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. You can't install it via Composer. 

You need to install it via your PHP installation. The way to do this depends on your operating system and your PHP setup.

Here are some general steps:

**For Ubuntu/Debian**

1. Update package lists for upgrades for packages that need upgrading, as well as new packages that have just come to the repositories.

    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

2. Install the zip extension

    ```
    sudo apt-get install php-zip
    ```

3. Restart your web server

    If you're using Apache:

    ```
    sudo service apache2 restart
    ```

    If you're using Nginx:

    ```
    sudo service nginx restart
    ```

    If you're using PHP-FPM:

    ```
    sudo service php-fpm restart
    ```

**For Windows**

1. Locate your `php.ini` file (you can check where it is from `phpinfo();`).
2. Open `php.ini` file and uncomment the line `;extension=php_zip.dll` (remove the semicolon).
3. Save `php.ini` and restart your web server.

**For Mac**

If you're using brew, you can use the following command:

```
brew install php@7.3-zip
```

Replace `7.3` with your PHP version.

After installing the extension, you can require it in your `composer.json` file like this:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": ">=7.0",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer update`.

This will not install the extension, but it will warn you if the extension is not installed.
