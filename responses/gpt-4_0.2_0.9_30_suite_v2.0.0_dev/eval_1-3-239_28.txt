Sure, here is a bash script that will install the specific version of Python you want using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
brew install python@3.6
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.6/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This script does the following:

1. Installs Python 3.6 using Homebrew.
2. Adds the path of this Python version to your PATH environment variable in your bash profile.
3. Sources your bash profile to apply the changes.

Please note that this script assumes that you are using bash as your shell. If you are using a different shell (like zsh), you would need to modify the script to update the appropriate profile file (like ~/.zshrc for zsh).
