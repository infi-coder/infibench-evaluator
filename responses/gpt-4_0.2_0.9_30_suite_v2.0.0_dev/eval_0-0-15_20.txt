Sure, you are getting the error because you are trying to instantiate an object, not a class. You should return a function that returns an object in your mock. Here is the revised version:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  // Returns a function that returns an object
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

Now, you can create a new instance of the API class without any issues:

```javascript
const api = new API();
```
