The error you're seeing is due to the fact that the `pdftk` binary you're trying to run is not compatible with the architecture of your CPU. This is a common issue on MacOS Catalina, which dropped support for 32-bit applications.

Here's how you can solve this issue:

1. Uninstall the current version of `pdftk` you have installed.

    ```bash
    brew uninstall pdftk
    ```

2. Install `pdftk-java` instead. This is a version of `pdftk` that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and thus is not dependent on your CPU architecture.

    ```bash
    brew install pdftk-java
    ```

3. Create a symbolic link to `pdftk-java` in `/usr/local/bin` so you can use `pdftk` command as before.

    ```bash
    ln -s /usr/local/bin/pdftk-java /usr/local/bin/pdftk
    ```

Now you should be able to use `pdftk` as before. Note that `pdftk-java` requires Java to be installed on your machine. If you don't have Java installed, you can install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew cask install java
```
