The error message indicates that Pillow could not find the headers or library files for zlib, which is a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source. 

However, you are using Python 3.8 and Pillow 6.0.0, which is not compatible. Pillow added support for Python 3.8 in version 6.2.0. So, you should upgrade your Pillow version.

You can try to install a newer version of Pillow using pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade Pillow
```

If you still encounter issues, you might need to install zlib manually. For Windows, you can download precompiled zlib binaries from [here](https://www.zlib.net/). After downloading and extracting the files, you need to add the path of the bin directory to your PATH environment variable.

If you are using a virtual environment in PyCharm, make sure to set the path in the virtual environment's settings, not in your system's environment variables.

After setting up zlib, try installing Pillow again. If you still encounter issues, please provide the full error message for further assistance.
