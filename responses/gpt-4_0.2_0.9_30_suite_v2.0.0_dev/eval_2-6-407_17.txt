The error message you're seeing indicates that the response from your API call is not valid JSON. The '<' character at the start of the response suggests that you might be getting an HTML response, possibly an error page.

The issue might be due to the route configuration of your API. In your API controller, you've defined the route as "[controller]" and then for your Index method, you've defined the route as "api/Employee/Index". This might be causing the issue because the final route would be "/Employee/api/Employee/Index" which is probably not what you want.

Try changing your API controller to:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class EmployeeController : ControllerBase
{
    EmployeeRepository objemployee = new EmployeeRepository();
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Employee> Index()
    {
        return objemployee.GetAllEmployees();
    }
}
```

And then in your Blazor app, you can call the API like this:

```csharp
empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("api/Employee");
```

This way, your API route will be "/api/Employee" which is a more standard convention.

Also, please note that `GetJsonAsync` method is obsolete since .NET 5.0. It's recommended to use `GetFromJsonAsync` method instead:

```csharp
empList = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<Employee[]>("api/Employee");
```

Remember to add `using System.Net.Http.Json;` at the top of your file to use `GetFromJsonAsync`.
