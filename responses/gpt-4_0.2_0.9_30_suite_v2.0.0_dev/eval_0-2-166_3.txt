In Tailwind CSS, you don't directly select elements like you would in traditional CSS. Instead, you apply utility classes directly to the elements you want to style in your HTML.

So, if you want to style direct children `div` of a parent `div` with class `section`, you would apply the styles directly to those child `div` elements in your HTML. 

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white"> <!-- Tailwind CSS classes here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white"> <!-- Tailwind CSS classes here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-blue-500` and `text-white` are Tailwind CSS utility classes applied directly to the child `div` elements.

Remember, Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means you generally apply styles directly to the elements you want to style, rather than writing traditional CSS selectors.
