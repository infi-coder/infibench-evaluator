The error you're seeing is due to Laravel's built-in CSRF protection. When you log out from one tab, the session is invalidated, and the CSRF token stored in the session is no longer valid. So when you try to log out from the other tab, Laravel can't find a valid CSRF token and throws a `419 Page Expired` error.

To handle this, you can catch the `TokenMismatchException` in your `Handler.php` file and redirect the user to the login page (or wherever you want). Here's an example:

```php
// app/Exceptions/Handler.php

public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof \Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException) {
        return redirect('/login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

This will catch the `TokenMismatchException` that's thrown when a CSRF token is invalid or missing, and redirect the user to the login page. This way, the user will just see the login page instead of a `419 Page Expired` error.

Remember to import the `Exception` class at the top of your `Handler.php` file:

```php
use Exception;
```

This solution assumes that you're okay with simply redirecting the user to the login page when a CSRF token mismatch occurs. If you want to handle this situation differently, you can modify the code in the `if` block to do whatever you want.
