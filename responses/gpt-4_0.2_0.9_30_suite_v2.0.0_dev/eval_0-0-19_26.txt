The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` cannot be found in the npm registry. This is because there is no package with that exact name in the npm registry.

If you're trying to install the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js, the correct package name is `aws-sdk`. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

This should resolve your issue.
