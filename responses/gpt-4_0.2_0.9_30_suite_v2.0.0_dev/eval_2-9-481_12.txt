Step1. Create the `manifest.js` file
```
$ mkdir -p app/assets/config 
$ touch app/assets/config/manifest.js
```
Step2. Then copy and paste the following into the file you just created:
```
//= link_tree ../images
//= link_directory ../javascripts .js
//= link_directory ../stylesheets .css
```
Those commenty things //= are called `directives`.
