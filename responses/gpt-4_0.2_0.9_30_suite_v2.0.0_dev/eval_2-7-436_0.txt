The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version is not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are the steps you should take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -v
```

If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, and XML. You can check your installed extensions by running:

```bash
php -m
```

If any of the required extensions are missing, you'll need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Although you've updated Composer to 2.3.10, it's worth double-checking the version by running:

```bash
composer --version
```

If your Composer version is correct and you're still encountering the issue, you might want to try updating Composer again:

```bash
composer self-update
```

4. **Try to install Laravel again**: After ensuring that your PHP version, PHP extensions, and Composer version meet the requirements, try to install Laravel 9 again:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.*"
```

If you're still having trouble, it's possible that Laravel 9 has not been released yet. At the time of writing, the latest stable version of Laravel is 8. You can check the latest version of Laravel on the [official Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/versions).
