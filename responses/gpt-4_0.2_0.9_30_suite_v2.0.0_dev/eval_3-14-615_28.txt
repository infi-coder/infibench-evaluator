No, as of now, SwiftUI does not provide a native way to get the current scroll position of a `ScrollView`. The `ScrollViewReader` and `ScrollViewProxy` only provide the `scrollTo` method, which allows you to programmatically set the scroll position, but not get it.

However, you can use `UIKit` components in SwiftUI via `UIViewRepresentable` and get the scroll position. This involves using `UIScrollView` and its delegate methods to get the current scroll position.
