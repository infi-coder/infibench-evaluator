Sure, the issue is that you're returning an object instead of a class or a function. Here is the revised version:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this revised version, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` is used to return a mock function that can be used as a constructor. This way, you can use `new API()` without any issues.
