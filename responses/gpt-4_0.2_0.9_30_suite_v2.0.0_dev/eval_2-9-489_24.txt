The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. This means that without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Open your Elasticsearch configuration file (`elasticsearch.yml`). The location of this file can vary, but it's often located in `/etc/elasticsearch`, `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch`, or `/usr/local/Cellar/elasticsearch/7.13.1/config`.

2. Add the following lines to the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save the changes and close the file.

4. Restart Elasticsearch. If you're using Homebrew, you can do this by running `brew services restart elasticsearch`.

5. Now, you need to set up passwords for the built-in users. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
    ```

    This command will prompt you to enter passwords for a number of built-in users, including `elastic`, `apm_system`, `kibana_system`, `logstash_system`, `beats_system`, and `remote_monitoring_user`.

6. Update your application's Elasticsearch client to use these new credentials. In a Rails application using Searchkick, you can do this by updating your `config/initializers/searchkick.rb` file:

    ```ruby
    Searchkick.client = Elasticsearch::Client.new(
      hosts: ["localhost:9200"],
      http_auth: {user: "elastic", password: "your_password"}
    )
    ```

    Replace `"your_password"` with the password you set for the `elastic` user.

7. Restart your Rails server.

Please note that enabling security will also enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) for the transport networking layer. If you want to disable this (which is not recommended), you can set `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` to `false`.

Also, remember to replace `"your_password"` with the actual password you set for the `elastic` user.
