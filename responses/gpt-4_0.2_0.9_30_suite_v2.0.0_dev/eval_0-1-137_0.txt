The error you're getting is because you're trying to redefine the `$theme-colors` map after it's already been defined in the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file. 

You should define your custom colors before importing Bootstrap's main SCSS file. Here's how you can do it:

```scss
// Import Bootstrap's functions first
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";

// Define your custom colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color,
  "secondary": #your-color,
  "success": #your-color,
  "info": #your-color,
  "warning": #your-color,
  "danger": #your-color,
  "light": #your-color,
  "dark": #your-color
);

// Then import the rest of Bootstrap
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Replace `#your-color` with the actual color values you want to use. 

This way, when Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file is imported (which is done inside the `bootstrap.scss` file), it will see that `$theme-colors` is already defined and it won't redefine it. 

Also, make sure you're using a version of Sass that is compatible with Bootstrap 5.1.0. Bootstrap 5 requires Dart Sass 1.33.0 or later, or LibSass 3.5.0 or later. The Sass 3 you're using might be an older version.
