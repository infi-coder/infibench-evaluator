Sure, you can use the `torch.cat` function to concatenate the two tensors along the third dimension. But before that, you need to add an extra dimension to `d` using `unsqueeze` function. Here is the function you asked for:

```python
import torch

def addTensor(inps, d):
    # Add an extra dimension to d
    d = d.unsqueeze(2)
    # Concatenate inps and d along the third dimension
    result = torch.cat((inps, d), 2)
    return result
```

This function first adds an extra dimension to `d` to make it have the same number of dimensions as `inps`. Then it concatenates `inps` and `d` along the third dimension (dimension index starts from 0). The resulting tensor will have a size of [64, 161, 2].
