Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. You are trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you haven't declared them. In VBA, you need to declare variables with the `Dim` keyword.

2. You are trying to use `query` as an object with a `Name` property, but you've assigned it a string value.

3. You are not using `currentSheet` anywhere in your code.

Here's a revised version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Set the query string and the current sheet
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Add a new ListObject with a QueryTable that uses the Power Query
    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code should work if the string in `Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1")` is the name of a Power Query in your workbook. If it's the actual M code of the query, you'll need a different approach, as you can't run M code directly from VBA.
