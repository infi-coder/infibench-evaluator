The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vite's dev server is binding to `localhost` by default, which means it's only accessible from within the Docker container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0`.

You can do this by updating your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, which should allow you to access the server from outside the Docker container.
