The error message `Parsing error: Cannot read file '.../tsconfig.json'.eslint` suggests that ESLint is having trouble finding your `tsconfig.json` file. 

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the `project` option under `parserOptions` as `"tsconfig.json"`. This means ESLint will look for `tsconfig.json` in the same directory as `.eslintrc.js`. If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory, you will need to provide the correct relative path.

Here's how you can fix this:

1. Determine the correct relative path from `.eslintrc.js` to `tsconfig.json`.
2. Update the `project` option in `.eslintrc.js` with this path.

For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would change the `project` option to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

Here's what the updated `.eslintrc.js` file might look like:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "../tsconfig.json", // Update this line with the correct relative path
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  // ...
};
```

Remember to replace `"../tsconfig.json"` with the actual relative path to your `tsconfig.json` file.

After making this change, restart your editor or ESLint server for the changes to take effect. If you're still seeing the error, double-check the path and make sure it's correct.
