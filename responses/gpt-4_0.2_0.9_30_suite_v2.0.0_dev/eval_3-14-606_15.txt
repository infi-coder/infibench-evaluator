It seems like there's a misunderstanding here. iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" that you can enable or disable like Android. 

The alert you're seeing is likely related to the provisioning profile used to sign the app. If the app was signed with a developer provisioning profile, it can only be installed on devices that are registered with the Apple Developer account that was used to create the profile.

Here are the steps you need to follow to install a developer-signed app:

1. The device's UDID needs to be registered with your Apple Developer account. You can find the UDID by connecting the device to a Mac, opening iTunes, selecting the device, and clicking on the serial number to reveal the UDID. Copy this UDID.

2. Log in to the [Apple Developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/).

3. Go to "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles".

4. Under "Devices" in the left-hand menu, click on "All".

5. Click the "+" button to register a new device.

6. Enter a name for the device and paste the UDID, then click "Continue".

7. Now you need to add this device to the provisioning profile that's being used to sign the app. Go to "Profiles" in the left-hand menu.

8. Find the provisioning profile that's being used to sign the app and click on it.

9. Click "Edit".

10. Under "Devices", check the box next to the device you just added.

11. Click "Generate" to regenerate the provisioning profile.

12. Download the updated provisioning profile and use it to sign the app.

After following these steps, you should be able to install the app on the device. If you're still having trouble, it's possible that there's an issue with the app itself, or with the way it's being signed.
