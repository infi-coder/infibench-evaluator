You can disable the animation in ViewPager2 by setting a new `ViewPager2.PageTransformer` that overrides the default animation. Here's how you can do it:

```java
viewPager2.setPageTransformer(new ViewPager2.PageTransformer() {
    @Override
    public void transformPage(@NonNull View page, float position) {
        // Disable the default sliding animation by not doing anything
    }
});
```

However, this will only disable the sliding animation. If you want to completely disable the ability to swipe between pages, you need to disable user input for the ViewPager2:

```java
viewPager2.setUserInputEnabled(false);
```

This will make it so that the user can only change pages by clicking on the TabLayout.
