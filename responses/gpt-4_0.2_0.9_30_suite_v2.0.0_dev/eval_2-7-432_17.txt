The "419 Page Expired" error is due to Laravel's CSRF protection. When you log out from one tab, the session is invalidated. So, when you try to log out from the second tab, the CSRF token associated with that session is no longer valid, hence the error.

To handle this, you can catch the `TokenMismatchException` in your `Handler.php` file and redirect the user to the login page. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```php
// app/Exceptions/Handler.php

public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof \Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException) {
        return redirect('/login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

This way, if a user tries to perform an action with an expired session (like logging out from a second tab), they will be redirected to the login page instead of seeing the "419 Page Expired" error.
