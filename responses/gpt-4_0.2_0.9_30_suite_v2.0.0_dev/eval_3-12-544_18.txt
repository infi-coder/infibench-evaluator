The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to use `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` before `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` has been called.

This is because `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` relies on platform channels, and these channels are not available until `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` has been called.

To fix this issue, you should call `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` before any asynchronous calls in your `main()` function. Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Add this line
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This ensures that the Flutter engine is initialized before you try to use platform channels.
