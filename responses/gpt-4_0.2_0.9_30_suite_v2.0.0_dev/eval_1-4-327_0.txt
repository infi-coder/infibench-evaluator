In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, R will automatically append a suffix to the duplicate column names to differentiate them. In your case, the column names will be "a" and "a.1".

So, to select the second column by name, you can use the following code:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

However, if for some reason the column names are not automatically adjusted and you have two columns with the exact same name, you can select the second column by its index:

```r
second_col <- d3[,2]
```

This will select the second column regardless of its name.
