The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled. Elasticsearch is warning you that without authentication, your cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Open your `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. This file is usually located in the `/etc/elasticsearch` or `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

   ```yaml
   xpack.security.enabled: true
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
   ```

3. Save and close the file.

4. Restart Elasticsearch.

If you're using Homebrew to manage your Elasticsearch installation, you can restart Elasticsearch by running the following command:

```bash
brew services restart elasticsearch
```

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning message should no longer appear.

Please note that enabling Elasticsearch's built-in security features will require you to set up user authentication. You can follow the instructions in the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html) to do this.

If you don't want to set up user authentication and you're okay with the potential security risks, you can ignore the warning message. It's just a warning and won't prevent Elasticsearch from running.
