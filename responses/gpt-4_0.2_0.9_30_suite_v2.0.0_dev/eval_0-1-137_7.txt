The error you're getting is because you're trying to import the Bootstrap variables before you define your own. Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file already contains a definition for `$theme-colors`, so when you try to redefine it afterwards, it causes a conflict.

To fix this, you should define your own variables before importing Bootstrap's variables and other styles. Here's how you can do it:

```scss
// Define your own theme colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color, // replace #your-color with your desired color
  // add other colors if needed
);

// Then import Bootstrap's styles
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

In this way, your color definitions will take precedence over Bootstrap's default colors. When the Bootstrap styles are imported, your colors will be used instead of the default ones.

Also, make sure you're using a valid color value. It can be a named color (like `red`), a hexadecimal color (like `#ff0000`), an RGB color (like `rgb(255, 0, 0)`), or an HSL color (like `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)`).
