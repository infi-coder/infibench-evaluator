The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or later. You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -v
```

If your PHP version is less than 8.0, you'll need to upgrade it. The process for this will depend on your environment.

In addition, Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions:

- BCMath PHP Extension
- Ctype PHP Extension
- Fileinfo PHP extension
- JSON PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension

You can check which extensions are installed with the following command:

```bash
php -m
```

If any of the required extensions are missing, you'll need to install them. Again, the process for this will depend on your environment.

Finally, make sure your Composer version is up to date. Laravel 9 requires Composer 2.0.8 or later. You can check your Composer version with the following command:

```bash
composer --version
```

If your Composer version is less than 2.0.8, you can update it with the following command:

```bash
composer self-update
```

After ensuring that your PHP version, PHP extensions, and Composer version meet the requirements, try running the `composer create-project` command again.
