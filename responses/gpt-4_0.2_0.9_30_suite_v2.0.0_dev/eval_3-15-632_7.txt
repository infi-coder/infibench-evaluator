Assuming that the data you want to split is separated by a specific character (like a comma, space, or tab), you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the string into an array and then assign each element of the array to a cell in Excel.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, " ") 'replace " " with your delimiter

    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4)

    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code assumes that `textline` contains five pieces of data separated by a space. If the data is separated by a different character, replace `" "` in the `Split` function with that character. If there are more or fewer pieces of data, adjust the indices of `splitData` accordingly.
