For the CSRF token mismatch issue, it could be due to a number of reasons:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the public directory of your Laravel application. Incorrect domain configuration could lead to issues with session management.

2. **Cookie Configuration**: Check your `config/session.php` file and ensure that the `domain` and `path` options are correctly set. If your application is on a subdomain, you should set the `domain` option to your root domain and the `path` option to `/`.

3. **HTTPS**: If your application is served over HTTPS, ensure that the `secure` option in your `config/session.php` file is set to `true`.

4. **Session Driver**: If you're using a different session driver in production, ensure that it's correctly configured. For instance, if you're using the `redis` driver, ensure that Redis is correctly installed and configured on your server.

For the email issue, the error message suggests that there's a problem with the SSL version being used. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Change Encryption Method**: Try changing `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` from `ssl` to `tls` in your `.env` file. Some servers use different encryption methods.

2. **Change Port**: Try changing `MAIL_PORT` from `587` to `465` or vice versa. Different servers use different ports for SSL and TLS.

3. **Disable SSL Verification**: If you're in a local or trusted environment, you could try disabling SSL verification by adding the following code to your `mail.php` configuration file:

```php
'stream' => [
    'ssl' => [
        'allow_self_signed' => true,
        'verify_peer' => false,
        'verify_peer_name' => false,
    ],
],
```

Please note that disabling SSL verification can expose you to security risks and should only be done in a trusted environment.

4. **Contact Your Email Provider**: If none of the above solutions work, you should contact your email provider for assistance. They might have specific requirements or restrictions for using their SMTP server.
