The error message you're seeing indicates that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are the steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    php -v
    ```
    If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, and XML. You can check your installed extensions by running:

    ```bash
    php -m
    ```
    If any of the required extensions are missing, you'll need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Although you've mentioned that you've updated Composer to version 2.3.10, it's worth double-checking. You can check your Composer version by running:

    ```bash
    composer --version
    ```
    If your Composer version is not up to date, you'll need to update it.

4. **Check Laravel 9 availability**: At the time of writing, Laravel 9 has not been officially released yet. The latest stable version is Laravel 8. You can check the latest Laravel version by visiting the official Laravel website or its GitHub repository.

If you've checked all these points and everything is in order, but you're still facing the same issue, it might be a problem with your Composer cache. Try clearing it with the following command:

```bash
composer clear-cache
```

Then try creating the Laravel project again.
