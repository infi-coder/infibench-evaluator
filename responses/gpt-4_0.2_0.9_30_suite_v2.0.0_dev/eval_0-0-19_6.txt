The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` indicates that npm cannot find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry.

The most likely reason for this is that the package name is incorrect. The correct package name for the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`.

You can install it by running:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

If you have `aws-sdk-js` in your `package.json` file, you should change it to `aws-sdk`.

If you're still having trouble, you might want to check your network connection or the status of the npm registry.
