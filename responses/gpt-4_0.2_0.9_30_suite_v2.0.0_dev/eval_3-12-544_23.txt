The error you're seeing is due to the fact that you're trying to use Flutter's engine bindings before they're actually initialized. The `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` function relies on Flutter's engine bindings, which aren't available until after `runApp()` has been called.

To fix this, you can use the `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` function before calling `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`. This function ensures that Flutter's engine bindings are initialized.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This should resolve the error you're seeing.
