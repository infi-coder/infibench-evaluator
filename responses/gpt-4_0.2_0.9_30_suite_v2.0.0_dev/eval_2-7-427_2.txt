## CSRF Token Mismatch

The CSRF token mismatch error could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your `APP_URL` in the `.env` file matches the domain you're hosting your application on. If there's a mismatch, Laravel might not be able to verify the CSRF token properly.

2. **Session Configuration**: Check your session configuration in `config/session.php`. Make sure the `domain` and `path` options are set correctly. If your application is in a subdirectory, the `path` should reflect that.

3. **Cookie Configuration**: Check your cookie settings in `config/session.php`. If the `secure` option is set to `true`, cookies will only be sent over HTTPS. If your production server doesn't use HTTPS, this could be causing the issue.

4. **Cache**: Try clearing the cache on your production server. You can do this with the command `php artisan cache:clear`.

## SMTP Connection Error

The error message you're seeing is indicating that there's a problem with the SSL connection to your SMTP server. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Encryption Type**: Try changing `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` in your `.env` file to `tls`. Some servers use `tls` instead of `ssl`.

2. **Port Number**: The port number you're using (587) is typically used with `tls`. If you're using `ssl`, the port number is usually 465. Try changing `MAIL_PORT` in your `.env` file to 465.

3. **Firewall or Security Software**: There might be a firewall or security software on your server that's blocking the connection to the SMTP server. Check your server's firewall settings and make sure that the port you're using for SMTP is allowed.

4. **Server Configuration**: There might be a problem with the SMTP server's configuration. You might need to contact the server's administrator or your client for help with this.

Remember to run `php artisan config:cache` after making changes to your `.env` file to clear the configuration cache.
