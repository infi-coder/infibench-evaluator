The problem might be due to the URL you are trying to access. For Springdoc (OpenAPI 3.0), the Swagger UI is not available at `localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` as it was with Swagger 2. Instead, you should be able to access it at `localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.

If you want to customize the Swagger UI path, you can do so by adding the following property to your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui.html
```

After adding this property, you should be able to access Swagger UI at `localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

Also, make sure that you have the necessary configuration to enable Swagger. If you don't have any `@OpenAPIDefinition` or `@SpringBootApplication`, add them to your main Spring Boot application class:

```java
import org.springdoc.core.SpringDocUtils;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    static {
        SpringDocUtils.getConfig().replaceWithClass(org.springframework.data.domain.Pageable.class, PageableAsQueryParam.class);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

This will enable Swagger for all your API endpoints.
