Yes, in Flutter, you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here is a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line is drawn between two text components. The `VerticalDivider` widget has several properties that you can adjust to suit your needs:

- `color`: This changes the color of the divider.
- `thickness`: This changes the thickness of the divider.
- `width`: This changes the total width of the divider, including the empty space on either side of the line.

Remember to wrap your components in `Expanded` widgets when using them in a `Row` with a `VerticalDivider`, to ensure they take up the remaining space equally.
