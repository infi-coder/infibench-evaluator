The error you're seeing is due to Laravel's built-in CSRF protection. When you log out from one tab, the session is invalidated, so the CSRF token in the other tab is no longer valid, hence the 419 error.

To handle this, you can catch the `TokenMismatchException` in your `Handler.php` file and redirect the user to the login page. Here's how you can do it:

```php
// app/Exceptions/Handler.php

use Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException;

public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof TokenMismatchException) {
        // Redirect to a form. Here is an example of how we can
        // return a view or just redirect to a login route
        // or any other page.
        return redirect('login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

This way, when a `TokenMismatchException` is thrown (which is what happens when a CSRF token is invalid), the user will be redirected to the login page instead of seeing the 419 error page.

Remember to import the `TokenMismatchException` at the top of your `Handler.php` file:

```php
use Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException;
```

This solution will work for all routes, not just the logout route. If you want to handle this specifically for the logout route, you could check the requested route in the `render` method and act accordingly.
