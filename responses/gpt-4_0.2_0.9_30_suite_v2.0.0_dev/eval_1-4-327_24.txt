In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, it actually appends a suffix to the column names to make them unique. So, in your case, the column names of `d3` would be `a` and `a.1`.

You can select the second column by its name as follows:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

However, if you are not sure about the suffix or if there are more than two columns with the same name, you can use the `duplicated()` function to select the second occurrence of the column name:

```r
second_col <- d3[,duplicated(names(d3))]
```

This will select all columns where the column name is duplicated, which in your case would be the second column named `a`.
