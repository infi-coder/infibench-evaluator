The problem you're facing is due to the version of Hibernate Validator. The `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations are part of the Bean Validation 2.0 specification, which is implemented by Hibernate Validator 6.0.0.Final and later versions.

However, your logs show that Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2 is being used, which does not support these annotations. This version is likely being provided by your application server (JBoss).

To solve this issue, you can try the following:

1. **Exclude the Hibernate Validator provided by JBoss**: You can do this by creating a `jboss-deployment-structure.xml` file in your `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/` directory with the following content:

```xml
<jboss-deployment-structure>
    <deployment>
        <exclusions>
            <module name="org.hibernate.validator" />
        </exclusions>
    </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
```

2. **Include Hibernate Validator 6.0.11.Final in your `pom.xml`**: Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

3. **Include the validation API 2.0.1.Final in your `pom.xml`**: Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.validation</groupId>
    <artifactId>validation-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

After making these changes, rebuild your project and redeploy it to JBoss. The `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations should now work as expected.
