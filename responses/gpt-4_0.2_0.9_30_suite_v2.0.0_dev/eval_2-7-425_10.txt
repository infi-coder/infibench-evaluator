You can use the `now()` function provided by Laravel to get the current date and time. Here is how you can modify your function:

```php
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array("name" => $name, "address" => $address, "created_at" => now(), "updated_at" => now());
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

The `now()` function will return the current date and time in the format required by your MySQL database.

However, if you are using Laravel's Eloquent ORM to manage your database operations, you don't need to manually set the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields. Laravel will automatically manage these fields for you. Here is how you can do it:

```php
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $student = new Student;
    $student->name = $req->input('name');
    $student->address = $req->input('address');
    $student->save();

    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

In this case, make sure your `Student` model extends the `Model` class provided by Laravel and you have `$timestamps = true;` in your `Student` model.
