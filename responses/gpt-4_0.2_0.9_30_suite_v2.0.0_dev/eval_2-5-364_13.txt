If you want to use a specific version of Java with Maven, you can specify the Java version in the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. The Maven Wrapper will use the version of Java specified in `JAVA_HOME`.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Find out the path to the Java version you want to use. This will be the directory that contains the `bin` directory where `java` executable is located. For example, it might be something like `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64`.

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to this directory. You can do this in the command line:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk
```

Replace `/path/to/your/jdk` with the actual path to your JDK.

3. Now, when you run the Maven Wrapper, it should use the specified version of Java.

Please note that this will only set the `JAVA_HOME` for the current terminal session. If you want to set it permanently, you can add the `export` line to your shell profile file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for Bash, `~/.zshrc` for Zsh).

If you're using a CI/CD tool, you can usually set environment variables in the job configuration. Check the documentation for your specific tool to see how to do this.
