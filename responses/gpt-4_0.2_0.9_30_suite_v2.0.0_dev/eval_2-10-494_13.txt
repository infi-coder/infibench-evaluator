The error message "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args`" is coming from rust-analyzer, which is a language server protocol implementation for Rust. It's not an error from the Rust compiler itself.

Rust-analyzer is a tool that provides features like autocompletion, go to definition, and error checking while you're writing your code. However, it's not perfect and sometimes it can report false positives or negatives.

In your case, it seems like rust-analyzer is having trouble resolving the `format_args!` macro that's used internally by the `assert_eq!` macro in your test. This is likely a bug or limitation in rust-analyzer, not an issue with your code.

If your code is compiling and running correctly, and the tests are passing, then you can safely ignore this error. You might want to report it to the rust-analyzer team so they can investigate and potentially fix it in a future update.

In the meantime, if the error message is bothering you, you can disable macro error diagnostics in rust-analyzer by adding the following to your settings.json file:

```json
"rust-analyzer.diagnostics.disabled": ["macro-error"]
```

This will tell rust-analyzer to not report any errors related to macros.
