Here is a function `mySplit` that uses the `strsplit` function to split the strings in `col1` by comma and colon, and then reshapes the data into a data frame:

```r
mySplit <- function(df) {
  # Split the strings in col1 by comma and colon
  split_data <- strsplit(as.character(df$col1), ",|:")
  
  # Reshape the data into a data frame
  df_new <- do.call(rbind, lapply(split_data, function(x) {
    data.frame(matrix(x, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)[, 2])
  }))
  
  # Set the column names
  colnames(df_new) <- c("name", "Age", "City")
  
  return(df_new)
}
```

You can use this function on your data frame `df` like this:

```r
df <- data.frame(col1 = c("name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC", "name:Tom,Age:25,City:NA"))
df_new <- mySplit(df)
```

This will give you a new data frame `df_new` with the split data.
