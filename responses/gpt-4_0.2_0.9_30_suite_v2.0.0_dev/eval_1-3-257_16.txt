Here is a Python function that divides an even number into N parts, each part being a multiple of 2:

```python
def divideNumber(num, n):
    # Calculate the base value and the remainder
    base_value = num // n
    remainder = num % n

    # Ensure base_value is even
    if base_value % 2 != 0:
        base_value -= 1
        remainder += n

    # Create the result list with base_value
    result = [base_value] * n

    # Distribute the remainder
    for i in range(0, remainder, 2):
        result[i // 2] += 2

    return result
```

This function first calculates the base value and the remainder. If the base value is not even, it is decreased by 1 and the remainder is increased accordingly. Then, the function creates a list with the base value repeated n times. Finally, it distributes the remainder by adding 2 to each element in the list in succession.

Let's test the function with your example:

```python
print(divideNumber(100, 3))  # Output: [34, 34, 32]
```

This function works as expected and returns the correct result.
