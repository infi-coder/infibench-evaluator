## CSRF Token Mismatch

The CSRF token mismatch error could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured in your `.env` file. The `APP_URL` should match the domain you're using.

2. **Session Configuration**: Check your session configuration in `config/session.php`. Ensure that the `domain` and `path` are correctly set. If your application is in a subfolder, the `path` should reflect this.

3. **Cookies**: Ensure that cookies are enabled and not being blocked by the browser. Also, check if your application is setting the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie correctly.

4. **HTTPS**: If your application is served over HTTPS, ensure that the `secure` option in `config/session.php` is set to `true`.

## Email Sending Issue

The error message you're seeing indicates that there's an issue with the SSL/TLS configuration. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Change Encryption Method**: Try changing the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` value in your `.env` file from `ssl` to `tls`.

2. **Use Correct Port**: Ensure that the `MAIL_PORT` is correct. Port `587` is typically used for `tls`, while port `465` is used for `ssl`.

3. **Check with Hosting Provider**: If the above steps don't work, you may need to check with your hosting provider or the email service provider to ensure that you're using the correct settings.

4. **Update OpenSSL**: If you're running your application on a server, ensure that OpenSSL is up to date.

Remember to clear the config cache (`php artisan config:cache`) after making changes to the `.env` file or config files.
