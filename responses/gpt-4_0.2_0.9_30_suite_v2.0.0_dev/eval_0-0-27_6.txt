The code you provided seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you can check if you're experiencing issues:

1. **Network Connection:** Make sure your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. The Apollo Client fetches data from a remote server, so a stable internet connection is required.

2. **Server Status:** Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can do this by simply pasting the URL into your web browser and checking if it returns a response.

3. **GraphQL Query:** Make sure the GraphQL query is correct and the server supports it. You can test the query using a GraphQL client like GraphiQL or Apollo Studio.

4. **Apollo Client Version:** There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading or upgrading the version.

5. **React Native Version:** There could be compatibility issues with the version of React Native you're using. Try downgrading or upgrading the version.

6. **Error Handling:** You might want to print out the error message to get more details about what's going wrong. You can modify your code like this:

```javascript
if (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
}
```

7. **Debugging:** Use React Native Debugger or similar tools to debug your application. This can help you identify if there are any issues with your React Native code.

If none of the above solutions work, please provide more details about the issue, such as error messages or logs, so that I can assist you further.
