Sure, the issue with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, not if each character of the input string is in the `correct` string. 

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = set(string.ascii_letters + string.digits)
    return set(text).issubset(correct)
```

This function works by converting both `text` and `correct` to sets, then checking if the set of characters in `text` is a subset of the set of characters in `correct`. This will return `True` if all characters in `text` are in `correct`, and `False` otherwise.
