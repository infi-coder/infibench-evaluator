The `rename()` function in pandas is used to alter axes labels, that is to change the names of the labels (index or columns) of the DataFrame. However, in your case, you are trying to rename the series returned by the `mean()` function, which is why you are getting the error.

Here is a function `renameDataFrame(df)` that should do what you want:

```python
import pandas as pd

def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg = avg.rename(columns = {"p":"mean"})
    return avg
```

In this function, `df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean()` will return a Series with the mean of "p" for each "t". `reset_index()` is used to convert the index "t" into a column of the DataFrame. Then, `rename(columns = {"p":"mean"})` is used to rename the column "p" to "mean". 

You can use this function like this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

datafile = 'your_data_file.txt'
datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])

avg = renameDataFrame(df)
```

In this code, replace `'your_data_file.txt'` with the path to your data file. The DataFrame `avg` will contain the average of "p" for each "t", with the column name changed to "mean".
