The error message is indicating that the `map-loop` function is not recognized. This function is not a built-in Sass function, and it's not defined in Bootstrap either. 

In Bootstrap, you can override the `$theme-colors` map before importing Bootstrap to change the default colors. Here's how you can do it:

```scss
// Import only the functions first
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";

// Define your custom colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color,
  "secondary": #your-color,
  "success": #your-color,
  "info": #your-color,
  "warning": #your-color,
  "danger": #your-color,
  "light": #your-color,
  "dark": #your-color
);

// Then import the rest of Bootstrap
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Replace `#your-color` with the actual color values you want to use. 

Also, make sure you have the latest version of Sass installed. Bootstrap 5 requires Dart Sass 1.33.0 or later, and it's not compatible with Node Sass or Ruby Sass. You can install Dart Sass with npm:

```bash
npm install -g sass
```

Then you can compile your Sass file with:

```bash
sass style.scss custom.css
```
