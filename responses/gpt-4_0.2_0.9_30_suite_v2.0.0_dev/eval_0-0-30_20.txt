Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17, created by the community. It's called `enzyme-adapter-react-17-updated`. Here is how you can use it:

First, install it using npm:

```bash
npm install --save enzyme-adapter-react-17-updated
```

Then, you can use it in your setup file like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-17-updated';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Please note that this is an unofficial adapter and may not be fully compatible or up-to-date with the latest changes in React 17. The official Enzyme adapter for React 17 is not yet available at the time of writing.
