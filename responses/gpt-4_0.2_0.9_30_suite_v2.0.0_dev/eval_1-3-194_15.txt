You can use the `openpyxl` library to write to an Excel file in Python. Here is the function `writeToExcel` that you requested:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = Workbook()  # Create a new workbook
    ws = wb.active  # Get the active worksheet

    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
            ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])  # Write to cell

    wb.save("data.xlsx")  # Save the workbook
```

This function creates a new Excel workbook, gets the active worksheet, writes the data from `new_list` into the worksheet, and then saves the workbook as "data.xlsx".

Please note that the row and column indices in `openpyxl` start from 1, not 0. That's why we're using `i+1` and `j+1` when writing to cells.

You need to install `openpyxl` if it's not already installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```
