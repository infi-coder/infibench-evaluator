Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17 that you can use. It's called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. Here is how you can adapt your code to use it:

First, install the adapter:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can use it in your code like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Please note that this is an unofficial package, so use it at your own risk. The official Enzyme package does not yet support React 17.
