You can use the `pkg_resources` module to get the installed version of a package, and then use the `yolk3k` package to get the latest version available on PyPI. Here's a function that does this:

```python
import pkg_resources
from yolk.pypi import CheeseShop

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the installed version
    installed_version = pkg_resources.get_distribution(pkgName).version

    # Get the latest version available on PyPI
    pypi = CheeseShop()
    versions = pypi.package_releases(pkgName)
    if not versions:  # No versions available on PyPI
        return False
    latest_version = versions[0]

    # Compare the versions
    return installed_version == latest_version
```

This function will return `True` if the installed version is the latest version, and `False` otherwise.

Please note that you need to install `yolk3k` package to use `CheeseShop` class. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install yolk3k
```

Also, please be aware that this function will raise a `DistributionNotFound` exception if the package is not installed. You might want to add error handling for this case.
