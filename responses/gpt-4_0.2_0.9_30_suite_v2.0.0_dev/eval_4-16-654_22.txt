You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by using the `ssh-add` command. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Git Bash.
2. Navigate to the directory where your SSH key is stored. In your case, it would be `D:/keys folder`. You can do this by typing `cd /d/keys\ folder`.
3. Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent with the `ssh-add` command. If your key is named `id_rsa`, you would type `ssh-add id_rsa`.

If you get an error that `ssh-add: command not found`, you may need to start the ssh-agent manually. You can do this with the following commands:

```bash
# Start the ssh-agent in the background
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent
ssh-add /d/keys\ folder/id_rsa
```

Please replace `id_rsa` with the name of your private key file.

Remember, the key must be in OpenSSH format. If you generated your key with PuttyGen, it might be in a different format. You can use PuttyGen to convert it to the required format:

1. Open PuttyGen
2. Click 'Load' and select your private key (`*.ppk` file)
3. Go to 'Conversions' from the menu and select 'Export OpenSSH key'
4. Save the new OpenSSH key when prompted
