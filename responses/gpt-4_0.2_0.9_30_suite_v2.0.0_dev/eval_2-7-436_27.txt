The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are the requirements for Laravel 9:

- PHP >= 8.0
- BCMath PHP Extension
- Ctype PHP Extension
- Fileinfo PHP extension
- JSON PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension

You can check your PHP version by running:

```bash
php -v
```

You can check your installed PHP extensions by running:

```bash
php -m
```

If your PHP version is less than 8.0, you need to upgrade it. If you are missing any of the required PHP extensions, you need to install them.

Also, Laravel 9 requires Composer version 2.1.0 or greater. You can check your Composer version by running:

```bash
composer --version
```

If your Composer version is less than 2.1.0, you need to upgrade it.

After ensuring that all the requirements are met, try running the `composer create-project` command again. If you still encounter issues, it might be because Laravel 9 is not yet released. As of the time of writing this response, the latest stable version of Laravel is 8.65.0. You can install it by running:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "8.*"
```
