The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vite's server is binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) by default, which is not accessible from outside the Docker container. 

You can change this by setting the `host` option in the `server` section of your `vite.config.ts` to `'0.0.0.0'`. This will allow the server to be accessible from any IP address, including from outside the Docker container.

Here's how you can modify your `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server from your host machine at `localhost:8080`.
