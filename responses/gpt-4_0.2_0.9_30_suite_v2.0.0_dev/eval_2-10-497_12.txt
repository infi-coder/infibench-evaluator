In Rust, the concept of null pointers doesn't exist in the same way as in languages like C or C++. Instead, Rust uses the `Option` type to represent a value that could be something (`Some`) or nothing (`None`). 

In your case, you can use `Option<Box<Node>>` to represent a pointer that might not point to anything. Here's how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

In this code, `Option<Box<Node>>` is used to represent a pointer that might not point to anything. If there's a `Node`, it's `Some(Box<Node>)`. If there's not, it's `None`.

To check if the `Box<Node>` is `None`, you can use the `is_none()` method:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    // The stack is empty
}
```

Or you can use pattern matching:

```rust
match stack.top {
    Some(node) => {
        // The stack is not empty, do something with `node`
    },
    None => {
        // The stack is empty
    }
}
```

Remember that Rust's safety guarantees mean you can't have null pointers in safe Rust code. The `Option` type is used to explicitly handle the case where there might not be a value, and Rust's type system ensures you handle both the `Some` and `None` cases.
