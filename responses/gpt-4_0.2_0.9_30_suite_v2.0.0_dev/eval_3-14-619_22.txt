Your code seems fine, but the issue might be that you're trying to test the `@Binding` behavior in the preview. The preview doesn't always behave the same way as the actual app, especially when it comes to state and binding.

Try to test your code in a real app environment. Here's an example of how you can use your `ContentView`:

```swift
struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var isSelected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ContentView(isSelected: $isSelected)
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}
```

In this `ParentView`, you have a `@State` variable `isSelected` that you pass as a `@Binding` to the `ContentView`. The `Text` view in the `ParentView` will also update when the button in the `ContentView` is clicked.
