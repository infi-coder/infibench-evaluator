The `ShapeStyle` protocol is used to define how shapes are filled or stroked. If you want to conform to `ShapeStyle`, you need to implement a method that applies the style to a shape. 

In your case, you can make `RedView` conform to `ShapeStyle` by implementing the `_apply(to:)` method. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        Color.red._apply(to: &shape)
    }
}
```

Now you can use `RedView` as a `ShapeStyle`:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedView())
    }
}
```

Please note that `_apply(to:)` is a private method, which means it's not intended for public use and may change in future versions of SwiftUI. Unfortunately, as of now, there's no public API for creating custom `ShapeStyle`s.
