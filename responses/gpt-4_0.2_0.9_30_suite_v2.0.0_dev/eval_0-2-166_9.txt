In Tailwind CSS, you don't directly select elements like you would in traditional CSS. Instead, you apply utility classes directly to the elements you want to style in your HTML.

So, if you want to style direct children of a `div` with class `section`, you would apply the styles directly to those child `div` elements in your HTML.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white"> <!-- Apply your styles here -->
    Content here...
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white"> <!-- And here -->
    More content...
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-blue-500` applies a blue background and `text-white` applies white text color to the direct children of the `section` div.

If you want to apply the same styles to all direct children of a `section` div, you might want to consider creating a custom CSS class and using `@apply` to reuse Tailwind's utility classes:

```css
.section > div {
  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white;
}
```

Remember to include this in your CSS file that is being processed by Tailwind's PostCSS plugin. This way, you can keep the utility-first philosophy of Tailwind and still apply styles to specific elements based on their hierarchy.
