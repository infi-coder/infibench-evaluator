The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling zip archives. It's not a Composer package, so you can't install it using `composer require`.

If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can install it via the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you're using Windows, you can enable it in your `php.ini` file:

1. Open your `php.ini` file in a text editor.
2. Search for the line `;extension=php_zip.dll`.
3. Uncomment it by removing the semicolon at the start: `extension=php_zip.dll`.
4. Save the file and restart your web server.

After installing or enabling the extension, you can add it to your `composer.json` file to declare that your project requires it:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1.3",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer update` to update your project's dependencies.

If the problem persists, it might be because the extension is not enabled in the CLI version of PHP. You can check this by running `php -m` in your terminal to list all enabled extensions. If `zip` is not listed, you need to enable it for the CLI version of PHP. The process is similar to the one described above, but you need to modify the `php.ini` file used by the CLI version of PHP. The location of this file can be found by running `php --ini`.
