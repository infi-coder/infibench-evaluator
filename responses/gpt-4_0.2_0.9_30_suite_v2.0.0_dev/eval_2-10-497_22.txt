In Rust, the concept of null pointers doesn't exist in the same way as in languages like C or C++. Instead, Rust uses the `Option` type to represent the possibility of absence. 

So, if you want to create a stack where each node may or may not have a next node, you should use `Option<Box<Node>>` instead of `Box<Node>`. Similarly, the top of the stack may or may not exist, so it should also be an `Option<Box<Node>>`.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

Now, you can check if the top of the stack is `None` (similar to null) or `Some(node)` (where `node` is the actual value):

```rust
fn is_empty(&self) -> bool {
    self.top.is_none()
}
```

This function will return `true` if the stack is empty (i.e., the top is `None`) and `false` otherwise.
