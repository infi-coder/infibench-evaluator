You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This pseudo-element is used to create the arrow. Here is how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may want to include vendor prefixes for older browsers */
    color: green;
}
```

However, the above code will not work because the arrow is not created using the color property. It is created using a background-image. So, you need to override the background-image with your own image or SVG. But Bootstrap 5 does not use an image for the arrow, it uses a CSS property `background-image` with a linear gradient to create the arrow. So, you can't simply change the color of the arrow. You need to create your own arrow with the desired color.

Here is an example of how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    background-image: none;
    content: "â–¼";
    color: green;
    display: inline-block;
    margin-left: .5rem;
    transform: rotate(-90deg);
}

.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    transform: rotate(0);
}
```

In the above code, we first remove the default arrow by setting `background-image` to `none`. Then we add our own arrow using the `content` property. We set its color to green. We also rotate it by -90 degrees to make it point to the right. When the accordion is collapsed, we rotate it back to 0 degrees to make it point downwards.
