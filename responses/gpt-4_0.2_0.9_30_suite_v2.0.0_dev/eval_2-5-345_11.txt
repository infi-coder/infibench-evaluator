This error is caused by an incompatibility between the version of Maven bundled with IntelliJ IDEA and the version of Maven used in the project. 

The error message `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.maven.model.validation.DefaultModelValidator: method 'void <init>()' not found` indicates that IntelliJ IDEA is trying to use a method in the `DefaultModelValidator` class that doesn't exist in the version of Maven used in the project.

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Update IntelliJ IDEA to the latest version. JetBrains regularly releases updates that include bug fixes and compatibility improvements.

2. Configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the same version of Maven as your project. You can do this in the "Maven" settings:

   - Go to "File" > "Settings" (or "Preferences" on macOS).
   - In the settings dialog, go to "Build, Execution, Deployment" > "Build Tools" > "Maven".
   - In the "Maven home directory" field, enter the path to the Maven installation that matches the version used in your project.

3. If the above steps don't solve the issue, you can try to invalidate the caches and restart IntelliJ IDEA:

   - Go to "File" > "Invalidate Caches / Restart...".
   - In the dialog that opens, click on "Invalidate and Restart".

Remember to always backup your work before performing these operations.
