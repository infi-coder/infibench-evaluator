The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` file is generated due to the `jar` task in Spring Boot 2.5.0. If you want to disable this, you can modify your `build.gradle` file to disable the `bootJar` task's `enabled` property.

Here is how you can do it:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

Add this to your `build.gradle` file. After this change, Gradle will not generate the `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` file.
