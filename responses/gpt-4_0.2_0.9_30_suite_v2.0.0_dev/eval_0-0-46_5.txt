The error message `Parsing error: Cannot read file '.../tsconfig.json'.eslint` indicates that ESLint is unable to find or read your `tsconfig.json` file.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the `project` property under `parserOptions` as `"tsconfig.json"`. This tells ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file.

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, you'll need to provide the correct relative path. For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would need to change the `project` property to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, then the issue might be with the content of the `tsconfig.json` file. The content you've provided seems fine, but you might want to double-check it for any syntax errors or misplaced commas.

If none of the above solutions work, try to delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file (if it exists), then run `npm install` again. Sometimes, the issue might be caused by corrupted or outdated dependencies.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about your project structure and where these files are located.
