You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by using the `ssh-add` command. However, before doing that, you need to start the ssh-agent in the background.

Here are the steps:

1. Start Git Bash.
2. Start the ssh-agent in the background:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace `id_rsa` in the command with the name of your private key file.

```bash
ssh-add D:/keys/id_rsa
```

Now your SSH key is added to Git Bash and you should be able to clone your repository.
