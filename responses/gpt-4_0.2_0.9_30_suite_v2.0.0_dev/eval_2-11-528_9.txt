You can disable the ordering of includes in clang-format by setting the `SortIncludes` option to `false` in your `.clang-format` configuration file. Here is how you can do it:

```yaml
SortIncludes: false
```

Just add this line to your `.clang-format` file. If the file doesn't exist, you can create it in the root directory of your project. 

Clang-format will read the configuration from this file and apply it to your project. By setting `SortIncludes` to `false`, clang-format will not sort `#include` directives.
