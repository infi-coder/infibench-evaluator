The error message you're seeing is indicating that the JSON deserializer is encountering an unexpected '<' character at the start of the response. This usually happens when the server is returning HTML instead of JSON, often because of an error page.

First, you should check your API endpoint to make sure it's returning the expected JSON data. You can do this by navigating to "/api/Employee/Index" in your web browser or using a tool like Postman.

If your API is working correctly, the issue might be with your route configuration. In your `EmployeeController`, you've specified a route at the class level (`[Route("[controller]")]`) and then again at the method level (`[Route("api/Employee/Index")]`). This could be causing some confusion.

Try changing your `EmployeeController` to look like this:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class EmployeeController : ControllerBase
{
    EmployeeRepository objemployee = new EmployeeRepository();

    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Employee> Index()
    {
        return objemployee.GetAllEmployees();
    }
}
```

This sets the base route for all methods in the `EmployeeController` to "api/Employee". The `HttpGet` attribute without a route specified defaults to the base route, so your `Index` method should now be accessible at "/api/Employee".

Then, in your Blazor code, you can get the data like this:

```csharp
empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("api/Employee");
```

If you're still having issues, it would be helpful to see the code for your `EmployeeRepository` and `Employee` classes, as well as any other relevant parts of your application.
