Sure, here is a bash script for installing a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current version of Python
brew unlink python

# Install the required version of Python
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed version of Python
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script assumes that you have Homebrew installed and that you have the necessary permissions to install software on your system.
