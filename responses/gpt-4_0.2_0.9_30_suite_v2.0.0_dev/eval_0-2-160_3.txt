The `sourceMap` option in `tsconfig.json` is used for debugging purposes. When you set `"sourceMap": true`, it tells the TypeScript compiler to generate corresponding `.map` files for each `.js` file it outputs. These `.map` files are source maps.

A source map is a file that maps from the transformed source (the JavaScript code that the browser runs) to the original source (your TypeScript code), enabling the browser to reconstruct the original source and present the reconstructed original in the debugger.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the TypeScript compiler will not generate these `.map` files. This means that if you try to debug your application in the browser, you will see the compiled JavaScript code instead of your original TypeScript code. This can make debugging more difficult because the JavaScript code can look quite different from your TypeScript code, especially if you're using advanced TypeScript features.

So, you might not see any immediate change in your app when you set `"sourceMap": false`, but if you try to debug your app in the browser, you'll notice the difference.
