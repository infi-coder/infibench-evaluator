You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how you do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, those changes will be applied to your current terminal session.

If you're using a different shell, like zsh (which is the default in macOS Catalina and later), you'll need to source the appropriate configuration file. For zsh, this would be:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

This will apply any changes you made to your `.zshrc` file.
