You can disable the swipe animation in ViewPager2 by using a custom `ViewPager2.PageTransformer`. Here's an example:

```java
viewPager2.setPageTransformer(new ViewPager2.PageTransformer() {
    @Override
    public void transformPage(@NonNull View page, float position) {
        if (position <= -1 || position >= 1) {
            // Page is not visible -- stop any running animations
            page.clearAnimation();
        } else if (position == 0) {
            // Page is selected -- reset any views if necessary
            page.clearAnimation();
        } else { 
            // Page is currently being swiped -- perform your animation here
            page.clearAnimation();
        }
    }
});
```

In this example, `clearAnimation()` is called on every page, effectively disabling the swipe animation. If you want to perform a custom animation, you can do so in the `else` clause. 

Remember to set the `ViewPager2`'s `PageTransformer` after you've set its adapter.
