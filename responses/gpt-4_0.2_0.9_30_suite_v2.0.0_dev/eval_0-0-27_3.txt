Your code seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you could check if you're experiencing issues:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. Apollo Client fetches data over the network, so a lack of connectivity could cause the query to hang.

2. **Server Availability**: The server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' should be up and running. If the server is down, the query will not be able to fetch any data.

3. **Correct Query**: Make sure that the GraphQL query `EXCHANGE_RATES` is correct and the server supports it. If the server cannot resolve the query, it could cause the query to fail.

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (e.g., "@apollo/client": "^3.3.7") and see if the problem persists.

5. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, there might be an issue with the network inspect. Try disabling it and see if the problem persists.

6. **React Native Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of React Native you're using. Try upgrading or downgrading to a different version and see if the problem persists.

If none of these suggestions work, it would be helpful to see any error messages you're getting. You can catch and log any errors from the `useQuery` hook like this:

```javascript
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES);

if (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching exchange rates:', error);
    return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
}
```

This will give you more information about what's going wrong.
