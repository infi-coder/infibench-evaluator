This issue can be caused by several reasons. Here are some steps you can try to solve it:

1. **Check your Python interpreter**: Make sure that you have selected the correct Python interpreter for your Jupyter notebook. You can do this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of the VS Code status bar and selecting the interpreter that matches your environment.

2. **Check your Jupyter server**: Try to start your Jupyter server manually from the command line to see if there are any issues. You can do this by activating your conda environment and running `jupyter notebook`.

3. **Reinstall Jupyter and ipykernel**: Sometimes, reinstalling Jupyter and ipykernel can solve the issue. You can do this by running the following commands in your conda environment:

```bash
conda activate da38
pip uninstall ipykernel jupyter
pip install ipykernel jupyter
```

4. **Check your VS Code settings**: Make sure that the `python.dataScience.jupyterServerURI` setting in your VS Code settings is set to `"Default"`. If it's set to a specific URI, VS Code might be trying to connect to a Jupyter server that isn't running.

5. **Check your firewall settings**: If you're running a firewall, it might be blocking the connection to the Jupyter server. Try disabling the firewall temporarily to see if that solves the issue.

6. **Check for errors in the Jupyter output**: You can view the Jupyter output in VS Code by opening the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), typing `Jupyter: Show Jupyter Output`, and selecting the command. This might give you more information about what's going wrong.

If none of these steps solve the issue, please provide more information about your setup and the exact error messages you're seeing.
