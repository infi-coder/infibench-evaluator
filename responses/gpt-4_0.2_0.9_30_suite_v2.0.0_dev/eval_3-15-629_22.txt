You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. This object is part of the Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library. Here is a simple example:

```vba
Dim MyData As DataObject

Set MyData = New DataObject
MyData.SetText "Your text to be copied"
MyData.PutInClipboard
```

This will copy the text "Your text to be copied" to the clipboard. You can replace the string with any variable or value you want to copy.

If you get an error about `DataObject` being undefined, you may need to set a reference to the Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library. You can do this in the VBA editor by going to Tools -> References, and then checking the box for Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library.
