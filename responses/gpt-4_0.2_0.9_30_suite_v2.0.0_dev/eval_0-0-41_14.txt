The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method is asynchronous and it takes two callbacks as arguments. The first callback is executed when the location is successfully retrieved and the second one is executed when there is an error. 

In your case, you are only handling the success case. You need to add an error callback to handle the case when the user denies the location access. Here is how you can do it:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In the above code, if the user denies the location access, the error callback will be executed and it will log "User not allowed". If the browser doesn't support geolocation, it will log "Geolocation is not supported by this browser.".
