Sure, the issue here is that you're mocking the `API` class as an object, not as a class. You should return a function (which acts as a constructor) that returns an object with the methods you want to mock. Here is the revised version:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

Now, `const api = new API()` should work as expected without throwing any errors.
