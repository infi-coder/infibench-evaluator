## CSRF Token Mismatch

The CSRF token mismatch issue could be due to several reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the `public` directory of your Laravel application. Misconfiguration could lead to issues with session management.

2. **Session Cookies**: Ensure that your application is correctly setting session cookies. If cookies are not being set correctly, Laravel will not be able to match the CSRF token sent in the request to the one stored in the session.

3. **HTTPS**: If your application is served over HTTPS, ensure that the `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE` environment variable is set to `true`. This will instruct Laravel to only send the session cookie over secure HTTPS connections.

4. **Session Domain**: If your application is served from a subdomain, you may need to specify the session domain in your session configuration file (`config/session.php`). Set the `domain` configuration option to your root domain (e.g., `.yourdomain.com`).

5. **File Permissions**: Ensure that the `storage/framework/sessions` directory is writable by the web server. If Laravel cannot write to this directory, it will not be able to store session data.

## SMTP Connection Error

The error message you're seeing suggests that there's a problem with the SSL configuration of your SMTP server. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Encryption Method**: Try changing the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` environment variable from `ssl` to `tls`. Some servers require `tls` instead of `ssl`.

2. **Port Number**: Ensure that the `MAIL_PORT` environment variable is set to the correct port number. Common port numbers for SMTP are 25, 465, and 587. The correct port number will depend on your server's configuration.

3. **Server Compatibility**: The error message suggests that there might be a compatibility issue between the SSL version used by your server and the one used by Laravel. You might need to update your server's SSL configuration.

4. **Firewall Settings**: Ensure that your server's firewall is not blocking connections to the SMTP server.

Remember to clear the configuration cache (`php artisan config:cache`) after making changes to your environment variables or configuration files.
