Font Awesome 5 has changed the way it handles its font families. Now, it has different font families for each style. The font families are:

- "Font Awesome 5 Free" for solid and regular styles
- "Font Awesome 5 Brands" for brand icons
- "Font Awesome 5 Pro" for the Pro package

Also, you need to specify the font-weight. For solid icons, use `font-weight: 900;` and for regular icons, use `font-weight: 400;`.

So, if you want to use a solid icon, you should change your CSS to:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

And if you want to use a regular icon, you should change your CSS to:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 400;
}
```

Please replace `"\f107"` with the unicode of the icon you want to use. You can find the unicode on the Font Awesome website.
