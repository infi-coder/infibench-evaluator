Here is a Python function `divideNumber` that divides an even number into N parts, each part being a multiple of 2:

```python
def divideNumber(num, n):
    # Calculate the quotient and remainder of the division
    quotient, remainder = divmod(num, n)
    
    # If the quotient is odd, subtract n from the quotient and add it to the remainder
    if quotient % 2 != 0:
        quotient -= n
        remainder += n

    # Create a list with n elements, each being the quotient
    result = [quotient] * n

    # Distribute the remainder among the elements of the list by adding 2 to each element in succession
    for i in range(0, remainder, 2):
        result[i // n] += 2

    return result
```

This function first calculates the quotient and the remainder of the division of the number by n. If the quotient is odd, it subtracts n from the quotient and adds it to the remainder. Then it creates a list with n elements, each being the quotient. Finally, it distributes the remainder among the elements of the list by adding 2 to each element in succession.

For example, if you call `divideNumber(100, 3)`, it will return `[34, 34, 32]`.
