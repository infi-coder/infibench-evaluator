Yes, in Flutter you can draw vertical lines between components using the `VerticalDivider` widget. 

Here is a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 2'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 3'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, `VerticalDivider` is used to draw vertical lines between three text widgets. The `color`, `thickness`, and `width` properties are used to customize the appearance of the divider. 

The `Expanded` widget is used to ensure that the text widgets and the dividers share the available space equally.

Please note that `VerticalDivider` is only visible when used in a `Row` widget. If you want to use a vertical divider in a `Column` widget, you can use a `Container` with a specified `height` and `width` instead.
