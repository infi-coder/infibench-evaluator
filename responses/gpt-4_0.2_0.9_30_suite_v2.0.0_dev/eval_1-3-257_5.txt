Here is a Python function that divides an even number into N parts, each part being a multiple of 2:

```python
def divideNumber(num, n):
    # Calculate the base value and the remainder
    base, rem = divmod(num, n)
    # Ensure the base value is a multiple of 2
    if base % 2 != 0:
        base -= 1
        rem += n
    # Distribute the remainder by adding 2 to each group in succession
    result = [base + 2 if i < rem // 2 else base for i in range(n)]
    return result
```

This function first calculates the base value and the remainder of the division. If the base value is not a multiple of 2, it decreases the base value by 1 and increases the remainder by `n`. Then it distributes the remainder by adding 2 to each group in succession.

Here is how you can use this function:

```python
print(divideNumber(100, 3))  # Output: [34, 34, 32]
```

This function ensures that the sum of the elements in the returned list is equal to `num` and each element in the list is a multiple of 2.
