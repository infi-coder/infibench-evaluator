Use `WillPopScope` instead of `Navigator.pop(context)` or `Navigator.of(context).pop()`. 

`WillPopScope` is a widget that detects when the user has pressed the back button on their device. It has a property called `onWillPop` that you can use to control whether the route should be popped. 

Here's an example of how you can use it to disable the back button:

```dart
return WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () async => false,
  child: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('Login Page'),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: Text('Login Page'),
    ),
  ),
);
```

In this example, the `onWillPop` function is set to return `false` which means the route will not be popped when the user presses the back button.
