The `navigator.geolocation` object is available in the browser, but it doesn't mean that the user has granted permission to access their location. The `getCurrentPosition` method is asynchronous and takes two callbacks: one for success and one for error. 

If the user has not granted permission, the error callback will be invoked. You should handle the error in this callback. Here is the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the geolocation is available and the user allows access, "Location accessed" will be logged. If the user denies access, "User not allowed" will be logged. If the geolocation is not available at all, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged.
