The error message you're seeing is related to the SSL/TLS version that's being used to establish a secure connection to the SMTP server. It seems like the version being used by your Laravel application is not compatible with the one used by the SMTP server.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Change the encryption method:** In your `.env` file, you have `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=ssl`. Try changing this to `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls` and see if that resolves the issue. If it doesn't, try setting `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null` to disable encryption (only do this for testing, as it's not secure for production use).

2. **Change the port number:** Different port numbers are used for different encryption methods. Port 587 is typically used for STARTTLS (which is what `tls` corresponds to in Laravel), while port 465 is used for SMTPS (which is what `ssl` corresponds to in Laravel). Try changing `MAIL_PORT=587` to `MAIL_PORT=465` in your `.env` file.

3. **Check the SMTP server settings:** The settings you're using to connect to the SMTP server (host, port, encryption method) need to match the settings expected by the server. Check with your client or the server administrator to make sure you have the correct settings.

4. **Update OpenSSL:** The error message mentions an OpenSSL error. Make sure you have the latest version of OpenSSL installed on your server, as older versions may not support the SSL/TLS version used by the SMTP server.

Remember to run `php artisan config:cache` after making changes to your `.env` file to clear the configuration cache and apply the changes.
