You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This pseudo-element is responsible for the arrow. Here is the CSS code:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may want to include vendor prefixes for older browsers */
    color: green;
}
```

Add this CSS code to your stylesheet or in a `<style>` tag in your HTML. This will change the color of the accordion arrow to green.

Please note that this will change the color of all accordion arrows. If you want to change the color of a specific accordion arrow, you should add a unique class or id to that button and replace `.accordion-button` with your unique class or id in the CSS code above.
