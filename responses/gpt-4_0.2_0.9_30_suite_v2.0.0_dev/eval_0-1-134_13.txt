It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a code editor called Emmet. Emmet allows you to quickly generate HTML and CSS code using shortcuts. For example, if you type `.classname` and hit `Tab`, it should generate `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If it's not working for you, here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check your code editor:** Not all code editors support Emmet out of the box. Popular editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom do, but if you're using a different editor, you might need to install a plugin or extension to get Emmet functionality.

2. **Check your file type:** Emmet usually only works in HTML and CSS files. Make sure your file is saved with the correct extension (`.html` for HTML files, `.css` for CSS files).

3. **Check your syntax:** Make sure you're using the correct Emmet syntax. For a class, it should be `.classname`, and for an id, it should be `#idname`.

4. **Check your settings:** If you're using an editor that supports Emmet, like Visual Studio Code, make sure you have it enabled in your settings. In VS Code, you can check this by going to `File > Preferences > Settings` and searching for Emmet.

If you've checked all of these and it's still not working, you might want to try reinstalling your code editor or looking for specific troubleshooting steps for your editor.
