The error message you're seeing is because you're trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`). In Entity Framework, indexes can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property, you should do it like this:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);` creates an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity. This should resolve the error you're seeing.
