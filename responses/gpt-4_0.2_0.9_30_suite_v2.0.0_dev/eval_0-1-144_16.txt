To change the color of the accordion arrow in Bootstrap 5, you can use the CSS `::after` pseudo-element. The arrow is generated by this pseudo-element. Here's how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may want to include !important to override Bootstrap's styles */
    color: green !important; 
}
```

This will change the color of the arrow to green. You can replace `green` with any color you want.

Remember to include this CSS after the Bootstrap CSS file in your HTML to ensure that it overrides the Bootstrap styles. If you're using a separate CSS file, make sure to link it after the Bootstrap CSS file. If you're using internal CSS, place the `<style>` tag containing this CSS after the Bootstrap CSS link in the `<head>` of your HTML.

Also, note that the `!important` rule is used to increase the specificity of a CSS statement, allowing it to override other CSS rules that might apply to the same element. It's generally recommended to avoid using `!important` where possible, but in some cases (like this one, where you're overriding a third-party library's styles), it can be necessary.
