You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This pseudo-element is responsible for the arrow. Here's how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is expanded */
    color: green;
}

.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is collapsed */
    color: green;
}
```

Add this CSS to your stylesheet, and it will change the color of the accordion arrow to green.
