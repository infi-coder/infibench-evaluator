The issue you're facing is due to a change in Android 12 (API level 31) that requires you to specify whether a `PendingIntent` is mutable or immutable.

The error message suggests that you should use `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` unless you need the `PendingIntent` to be mutable, for example, if it needs to be used with inline replies or bubbles.

The problem is that the `MediaSessionCompat` class in the AndroidX Media library is trying to create a `PendingIntent` without specifying either `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` or `FLAG_MUTABLE`. This is a known issue and has been reported to Google's issue tracker.

As a workaround, you can try to create a `MediaButtonReceiver` and set it before creating the `MediaSessionCompat`:

```kotlin
override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()

    val mediaButtonIntent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_BUTTON)
    mediaButtonIntent.setClass(this, MediaButtonReceiver::class.java)
    val pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, mediaButtonIntent, PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE)
    MediaSessionCompat.setMediaButtonReceiver(pendingIntent)

    mediaSession = MediaSessionCompat(this, TAG).apply {
        setCallback(mediaSessionCallback)
        isActive = true
    }
    ...
}
```

This code creates a `PendingIntent` with `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` and sets it as the media button receiver before creating the `MediaSessionCompat`. This should prevent the `MediaSessionCompat` from trying to create its own `PendingIntent` without the required flags.

Please note that you need to create a `MediaButtonReceiver` class if you haven't done so already. This class should extend `BroadcastReceiver` and handle the `ACTION_MEDIA_BUTTON` intent.

```kotlin
class MediaButtonReceiver : BroadcastReceiver() {
    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
        // Handle media button intent here
    }
}
```

Remember to declare the `MediaButtonReceiver` in your AndroidManifest.xml:

```xml
<receiver android:name=".MediaButtonReceiver">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MEDIA_BUTTON" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

This workaround should fix the issue until Google releases a fix in the AndroidX Media library.
