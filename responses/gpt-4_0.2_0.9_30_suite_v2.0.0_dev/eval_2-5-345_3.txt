The error message you're seeing is related to a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the version of Maven that's being used in your project.

The issue is that IntelliJ IDEA is trying to use a method in the `org.apache.maven.model.validation.DefaultModelValidator` class that doesn't exist in the version of Maven that's being used in your project.

Here are a few ways to resolve this issue:

1. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: JetBrains regularly releases updates for IntelliJ IDEA that often include fixes for compatibility issues like this one. Check if there's an update available for IntelliJ IDEA and install it if there is.

2. **Downgrade Maven version**: If updating IntelliJ IDEA doesn't resolve the issue, you could try downgrading the version of Maven that's being used in your project. You can do this by changing the version number in the `<version>` tag in your `pom.xml` file.

3. **Change IntelliJ IDEA's bundled Maven version**: IntelliJ IDEA comes with a bundled version of Maven that it uses by default. You can change this to use the version of Maven that's being used in your project. To do this, go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven` and change the `Maven home directory` to the directory where your project's Maven is installed.

4. **Re-import the project**: Sometimes, simply re-importing the project can resolve issues like this. To re-import the project, right-click on the project in the Project tool window and select `Maven > Reimport`.

Remember to always backup your project before making any changes.
