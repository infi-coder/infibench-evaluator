You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, those changes will be applied to your current terminal session.

If you're using a different shell like zsh, and your configuration is in `.zshrc`, you would use:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

This is equivalent to `.` command in bash:

```bash
. ~/.bash_profile
```

These commands will not restart your terminal, but they will apply any new changes you've made to your shell configuration file.
