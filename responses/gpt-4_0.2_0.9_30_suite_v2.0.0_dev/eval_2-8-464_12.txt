The error you're encountering is due to the fact that AWS Lambda expects a Linux binary, but you're building your Go application on a Windows machine, which produces a Windows binary. 

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code to a Linux binary. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables before building your Go application.

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
set GOOS=linux
set GOARCH=amd64
go build -o main main.go
```

This will create a Linux binary named `main`. After that, you can zip this binary and upload it to AWS Lambda.

```bash
zip function.zip main
```

Now, you can upload the `function.zip` file to AWS Lambda. 

Remember to set the handler name to `main` (the name of your binary) in AWS Lambda configuration. 

After these steps, your Lambda function should work as expected.
