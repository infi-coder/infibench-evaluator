The issue might be related to the URL you are trying to access. For Springdoc (OpenAPI 3.0), the Swagger UI is not available at `/swagger-ui.html` anymore. 

Instead, you should be able to access the Swagger UI at the following URL:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

Or, you can use the simplified URL:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/
```

Also, make sure your application is running on port 8080. If it's running on a different port, you need to adjust the URL accordingly.

If you still can't access the Swagger UI, you might need to check your Spring Boot configuration. Ensure that Springdoc's OpenAPI and Swagger UI are enabled and properly configured.
