The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It's actually part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

You need to make sure that you have the correct version of Entity Framework Core installed. The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in EF Core 5.0. If you're using a version older than 5.0, you won't have access to this attribute.

To use it, you need to add the following using directive at the top of your file:

```c#
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Then you can use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class:

```c#
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    //...
}
```

And in your `DbContext`:

```c#
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

You can then use it as you described:

```c#
_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)
```

Make sure to update your Entity Framework Core package if you're using a version older than 5.0. You can do this via NuGet package manager in Visual Studio or by running the following command in your Package Manager Console:

```shell
Update-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -Version 5.0.0
```

Replace `5.0.0` with the latest version if there's a newer one available.
