The error message suggests that the command you're trying to run has a malformed argument due to an embedded quote. This is likely due to the way the command is being parsed.

The issue is with the way the command is being quoted. You have double quotes inside double quotes which is causing the issue. 

Try to replace the inner double quotes with single quotes. Here's how your command should look like:

```bash
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "\"\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd\" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path='C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar' -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install\""
```

If the issue persists, you may want to check if the path to the `mvn.cmd` file is correct and the file exists at that location. Also, ensure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is correctly set to the path of your JDK installation.
