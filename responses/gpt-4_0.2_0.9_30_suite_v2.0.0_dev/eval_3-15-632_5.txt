Assuming that the data you want to split is separated by a specific character (like a space or a comma), you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the data into an array and then assign each element of the array to a different column. Here's how you can do it:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, " ") 'replace " " with your delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code splits the `textline` into an array `splitData` using a space as a delimiter. Then it assigns each element of the array to a different column. You should replace `" "` in the `Split` function with the actual delimiter in your data. If the delimiter is a comma, for example, you would use `Split(textline, ",")`.
