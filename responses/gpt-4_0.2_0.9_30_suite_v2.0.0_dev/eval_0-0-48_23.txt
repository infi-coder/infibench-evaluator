Sure, you can use the `&` operator to combine two types in TypeScript. Here is the correct definition of the `FruitsAndColors` type:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This type will have a numeric property for each fruit and a boolean property for each color.
