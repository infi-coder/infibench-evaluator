Sure, you're getting the error because you're trying to instantiate an object, not a class. You should return a function that returns an object in your mock to simulate a class. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this way, when you call `new API()`, it will return a new object with the `someMethod` function.
