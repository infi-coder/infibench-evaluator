The error message you're seeing indicates that the Pillow library is having trouble finding the zlib library, which is a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source.

However, the Pillow version you're trying to install (6.0.0) is not compatible with Python 3.8. You can see this in the warning message:

```bash
C:\Users\rijal\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-install-di5is9gd\Pillow\setup.py:29: RuntimeWarning: Pillow does not yet support Python 3.8 and does not yet provide prebuilt Windows binaries. We do not recommend building from source on Windows.
```

To solve this issue, you should install a more recent version of Pillow that supports Python 3.8. You can do this by simply running:

```bash
pip install pillow --upgrade
```

This command will upgrade Pillow to the latest version, which should be compatible with Python 3.8.

If you still encounter issues, it might be due to a problem with your Python environment. In that case, consider creating a new virtual environment and installing Pillow there:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate
pip install pillow
```

This will create a new virtual environment named `myenv`, activate it, and then install Pillow in this isolated environment.
