Yes, in Flutter you can draw vertical lines (vertical dividers) between components using the `VerticalDivider` widget. 

Here is a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 1'),
    ),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1.0,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 2'),
    ),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1.0,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 3'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, `VerticalDivider` is used to draw vertical lines between three text widgets. You can customize the color and thickness of the divider as per your needs.

Please note that `VerticalDivider` is a widget that displays a vertical line with a thickness defined by `thickness` parameter. It's always centered within its parent widget. If you want to control its height, you can wrap it in a `Container` or `SizedBox`.
