This issue can be caused by a number of factors. Here are some steps you can try to resolve it:

1. **Check your Python interpreter**: Make sure you have selected the correct Python interpreter for your Jupyter notebook. You can do this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of the VS Code status bar and selecting the interpreter that matches your environment.

2. **Reinstall Jupyter and ipykernel**: Sometimes, reinstalling these packages can solve the problem. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```markdown
conda activate da38
pip uninstall ipykernel jupyter
pip install ipykernel jupyter
```

3. **Update VS Code and Python extension**: Make sure you are using the latest version of VS Code and the Python extension. You can update VS Code by going to Help > Check for Updates. You can update the Python extension by going to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), finding the Python extension, and clicking Update.

4. **Check your Jupyter server logs**: If you're still having trouble, you can check the Jupyter server logs for more information. You can do this by going to the Output view (Ctrl+Shift+U), selecting "Jupyter" from the dropdown menu, and looking at the logs.

5. **Reset VS Code settings**: If all else fails, you can try resetting your VS Code settings. You can do this by going to File > Preferences > Settings, searching for "python.dataScience", and clicking "Reset Setting" for each setting.

If none of these steps work, please provide more information about your setup (e.g., Python version, Jupyter version, VS Code version, Python extension version) so we can better assist you.
