Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs. It doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would in traditional CSS with the `>` selector.

However, you can still achieve this by using JavaScript (or jQuery) along with Tailwind CSS classes. Here's an example using vanilla JavaScript:

```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('div.section > div').forEach((element) => {
  element.classList.add('your-tailwind-classes');
});
```

In this example, replace `'your-tailwind-classes'` with the Tailwind CSS classes you want to apply to the direct children of `div.section`.

Remember, Tailwind CSS is not a replacement for CSS, but a tool to help you write CSS more efficiently. For complex selectors, you should still use traditional CSS.
