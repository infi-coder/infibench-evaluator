The error you're seeing is due to the fact that you're trying to use Flutter's plugin services before `runApp()` has been called. The plugin services are not available until `runApp()` is called. 

To fix this, you should move your code inside the `main()` function into the `initState()` method of your root widget. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  MyHomePage({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key);

  final String title;

  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initHive();
  }

  Future<void> initHive() async {
    final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
    // rest of your code...
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // ...
  }
}
```
In this example, the `initHive()` method is called from `initState()`, which is the first method called when the widget is inserted into the tree. This ensures that the plugin services are available when you try to use them.
