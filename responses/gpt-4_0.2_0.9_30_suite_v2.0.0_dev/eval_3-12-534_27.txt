You can use the `MultiProvider` widget to provide multiple providers to your widget tree. However, if you want to consume multiple providers in a single widget, you can nest multiple `Consumer` widgets.

Here is an example:

```dart
Consumer<Provider1>(
  builder: (context, provider1, child) {
    return Consumer<Provider2>(
      builder: (context, provider2, child) {
        return Consumer<Provider3>(
          builder: (context, provider3, child) {
            return Consumer<Provider4>(
              builder: (context, provider4, child) {
                return CurvedNavigationBar(
                  // Use provider1, provider2, provider3, provider4 here
                );
              },
            );
          },
        );
      },
    );
  },
)
```

In this example, `Provider1`, `Provider2`, `Provider3`, and `Provider4` are the classes that extend `ChangeNotifier`.

However, if you find yourself nesting a lot of `Consumer` widgets, you might want to consider using the `Consumer2`, `Consumer3`, etc. widgets, which allow you to consume multiple providers in a single widget. Here's how you can do it:

```dart
Consumer4<Provider1, Provider2, Provider3, Provider4>(
  builder: (context, provider1, provider2, provider3, provider4, child) {
    return CurvedNavigationBar(
      // Use provider1, provider2, provider3, provider4 here
    );
  },
)
```

In this example, `Consumer4` is used to consume four different providers. Note that `Consumer2`, `Consumer3`, etc. are part of the `provider` package and not the Flutter SDK itself.
