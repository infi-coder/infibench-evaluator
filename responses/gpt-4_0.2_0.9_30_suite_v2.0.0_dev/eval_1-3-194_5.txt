You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write data into an Excel file. Here is the function `writeToExcel`:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = Workbook()

    # grab the active worksheet
    ws = wb.active

    # write rows to the active worksheet
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        ws.append(new_list[i])

    # Save the file
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function will create a new Excel file named "data.xlsx" and write the list of lists into the file. Each inner list will be written as a new row in the Excel file.

Please note that you need to install `openpyxl` library if it's not already installed. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install openpyxl
```
