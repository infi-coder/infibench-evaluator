Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17 named `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. You can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can use it in your code like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Please note that this is an unofficial package, so it might not be as stable or up-to-date as the official ones. The official Enzyme package does not yet support React 17.
