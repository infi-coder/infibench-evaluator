Sure, here is the revised Python function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:] + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
        pig_latin_words.append(endString)
    return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)
```

This function splits the input text into words, then for each word, it moves the first character to the end, appends "ay", and adds the transformed word to the list. Finally, it joins all the words in the list into a string with spaces in between.
