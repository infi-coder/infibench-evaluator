Assuming that your data is separated by a specific character (like a comma, space, or tab), you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the string into an array and then assign each array element to a separate cell. Here is how you can do it:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, ",") ' replace "," with your delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

Please replace `","` with your delimiter in the `Split` function. If your data is separated by a space, use `" "`; if it's separated by a tab, use `vbTab`.

Also, please make sure that every line of data has exactly 5 elements to split into. If not, you might need to add some error checking to prevent out-of-bounds errors.
