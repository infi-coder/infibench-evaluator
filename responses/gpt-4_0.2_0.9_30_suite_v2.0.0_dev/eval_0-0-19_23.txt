The error message indicates that npm cannot find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry. This is because there is no package with the name `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry.

If you are trying to install the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js, the correct package name is `aws-sdk`. 

You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

This should solve your problem.
