Sure, you're getting the error because you're trying to instantiate an object, not a class. Here's how you can revise your code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this revised version, we're mocking the `API` class to return a new instance of the class with the `someMethod` method when it's instantiated. This way, you can use `new API()` without any issues.
