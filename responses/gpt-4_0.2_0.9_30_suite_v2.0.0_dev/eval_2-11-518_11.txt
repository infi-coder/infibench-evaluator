The Rule of Five is not outdated, but its usage has been reduced due to the introduction of smart pointers in C++11. 

Smart pointers, such as `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`, handle their own memory and don't require explicit definition of the destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, or move assignment operator. This makes them very useful for resource management.

However, there are still cases where the Rule of Five is applicable:

1. **Performance optimization**: Sometimes, for performance reasons, you might want to manage memory yourself. In such cases, you would need to follow the Rule of Five.

2. **Legacy code**: If you're working with older code that doesn't use smart pointers, you'll need to follow the Rule of Five.

3. **Custom resource management**: If you're managing a resource other than memory (like a file or a network connection), you might need to follow the Rule of Five.

4. **Ownership semantics**: If your class has unique ownership semantics that can't be expressed with the existing smart pointers, you might need to follow the Rule of Five.

So, while smart pointers have reduced the need for the Rule of Five, they haven't eliminated it completely. It's still a useful concept to understand and apply when necessary.
