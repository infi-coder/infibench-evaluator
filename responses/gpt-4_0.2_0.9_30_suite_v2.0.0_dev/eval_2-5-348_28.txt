The error message you're seeing is due to the way the command is being interpreted by the command line. The command line is having trouble with the embedded quotes in the command.

To solve this problem, you can try to escape the quotes using the backslash (`\`) character. 

Here is the corrected command:

```bash
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "\"\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd\" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path=\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar\" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install\""
```

If the problem persists, you might want to check the following:

- Ensure that the paths in the command are correct and that the files exist in those locations.
- Make sure that you have the necessary permissions to execute the command.
- Check if the command works outside of NetBeans, directly in the command line. If it does, the problem might be with the way NetBeans is executing the command.
- Try to update your NetBeans and Java JDK to the latest version. Sometimes, these kinds of problems can be caused by bugs that have been fixed in later versions.
