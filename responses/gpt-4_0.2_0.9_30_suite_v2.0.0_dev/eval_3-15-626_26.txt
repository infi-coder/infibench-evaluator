Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. You need to declare your variables `query` and `currentSheet`.
2. You're trying to use `query.Name` but `query` is a string, not an object, so it doesn't have a `Name` property.
3. You're not using `currentSheet` anywhere in your code.

Here's a revised version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Get the query from Sheet6
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Get the current sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Add a new ListObject with a QueryTable that uses the Power Query
    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code assumes that the `query` string in cell A1 of Sheet6 is the name of a Power Query in the workbook. If it's the actual M code of the Power Query, you'll need to create a new Power Query with this M code first. Unfortunately, creating a new Power Query from M code is not directly supported in VBA. You might need to use some workarounds or third-party libraries for this.
