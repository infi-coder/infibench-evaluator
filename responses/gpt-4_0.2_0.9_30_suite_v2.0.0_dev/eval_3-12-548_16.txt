Use `WillPopScope` instead of `Navigator.pop(context)` or `Navigator.of(context).pop()`. 

`WillPopScope` is a widget in Flutter that detects when the user has pressed the back button on their device, or when the user has swiped to go back on iOS, and calls a function that you provide. This function should return a Future that resolves to a boolean, which indicates whether the app should be popped.

Here's a sample code snippet:

```dart
return WillPopScope(
    onWillPop: () async => false,
    child: Scaffold(
        // your widget tree
    ),
);
```

In this case, the `onWillPop` function always returns `false`, which means the back button will be completely disabled on this screen.
