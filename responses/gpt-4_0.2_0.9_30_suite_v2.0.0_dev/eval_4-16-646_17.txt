The error message `bad CPU type in executable` usually means that the binary you are trying to run is not compatible with the architecture of your CPU. In your case, it seems that the version of `pdftk` you have installed is not compatible with your Mac's CPU.

Since macOS Catalina, Apple has dropped support for 32-bit applications. If you're trying to run a 32-bit version of `pdftk`, you will get this error.

Here's how you can solve this issue:

1. Uninstall the current version of `pdftk`:

    ```bash
    brew uninstall pdftk
    ```

2. Install `pdftk-java` which is a reimplementation of `pdftk` in Java:

    ```bash
    brew install pdftk-java
    ```

3. Create a symbolic link to `pdftk-java`:

    ```bash
    ln -s /usr/local/bin/pdftk /usr/local/bin/pdftk-java
    ```

Now, you should be able to use `pdftk` as before.

Please note that `pdftk-java` requires Java 7 or later to be installed on your system. If you don't have Java installed, you can install it using Homebrew:

```bash
brew cask install adoptopenjdk
```
