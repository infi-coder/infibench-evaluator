In Rust, the concept of null pointers doesn't exist in the same way as in languages like C++. Instead, Rust uses the `Option` type to represent a value that could be something or nothing (`Some` or `None`).

You can use `Option<Box<Node>>` to represent a nullable `Box<Node>`. Here is how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

In this case, `None` represents a null pointer. You can check if a `Box<Node>` is null by checking if it's `None`:

```rust
if let Some(node) = &stack.top {
    // stack.top is not null
} else {
    // stack.top is null
}
```

Or you can use `is_none()` or `is_some()` methods:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    // stack.top is null
} else {
    // stack.top is not null
}
```

This way, Rust ensures safety by making sure you handle the case when the `Box<Node>` could be null.
