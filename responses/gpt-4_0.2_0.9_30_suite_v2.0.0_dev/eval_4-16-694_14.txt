You can use `awk` to extract the language code. Here is a command that should work for both cases:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | head -1 | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'
```

This command works as follows:

- `curl -Ls stick-it.app` fetches the HTML of the page.
- `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'` extracts the `lang` attribute. The `-o` option tells `grep` to only output the matched part of the line, and the regular expression `'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'` matches the `lang` attribute and its value.
- `head -1` takes only the first match.
- `awk -F'"' '{print $2}'` splits the line at the `"` character and prints the second field, which is the language code.

This command should work even if the `lang` attribute is not the third attribute in the `html` tag, and it should correctly handle language codes that contain a hyphen.
