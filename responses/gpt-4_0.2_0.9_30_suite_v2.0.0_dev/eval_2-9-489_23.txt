The warning message you are seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled. Without authentication, your cluster could be accessible to anyone. 

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Open your `elasticsearch.yml` file. This file is usually located in the `/etc/elasticsearch` or `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory.

2. Add the following lines to the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yml
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

If you are using Elasticsearch with Docker, you can pass these configurations as environment variables:

```bash
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" -e "xpack.security.enabled=true" -e "xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled=true" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.13.1
```

After enabling the security features, you will need to set up passwords for the built-in users. You can do this by running the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` command:

```bash
./bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto
```

This command will generate random passwords for all built-in users, including the `elastic` user.

Remember to update your application's Elasticsearch client with the new `elastic` user password.

Please note that enabling security features will require all requests to Elasticsearch to be authenticated. Make sure your application is prepared to handle this.
