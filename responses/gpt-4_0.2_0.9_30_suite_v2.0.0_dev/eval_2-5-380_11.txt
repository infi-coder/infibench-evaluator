The issue you're facing might be due to the change in the URL path for Swagger UI in the newer versions of `springdoc-openapi-ui`. 

In the newer versions, the Swagger UI is not available at `/swagger-ui.html` anymore. Instead, it's available at `/swagger-ui/index.html` or `/swagger-ui/`.

So, try accessing Swagger UI at:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/
```

or

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

If you want to customize the Swagger UI path, you can do so by adding the following property to your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/your-custom-path
```

Replace `/your-custom-path` with your desired path. After this, you can access Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/your-custom-path`.

Also, ensure that your Spring Boot application is running and accessible at `localhost:8080`.
