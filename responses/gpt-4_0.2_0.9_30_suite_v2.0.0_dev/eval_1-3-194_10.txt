You can use the `openpyxl` library to write data into an Excel file. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

Here is the function `writeToExcel`:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active

    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
            ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new Excel file named "data.xlsx" and writes the `new_list` into the file. The `ws.cell` method is used to write data into a specific cell. The `row` and `column` parameters are 1-indexed, so we add 1 to the indices of the list.
