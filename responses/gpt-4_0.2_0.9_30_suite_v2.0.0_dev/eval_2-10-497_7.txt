In Rust, a `Box<T>` cannot be null. It's a non-nullable pointer. If you want to have a nullable pointer, you should use `Option<Box<T>>` instead. `None` would represent a null pointer and `Some(box)` would represent a valid pointer.

Here is how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

To check if the `Box<Node>` is null, you can use the `is_none()` method:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    println!("The stack is empty");
} else {
    println!("The stack is not empty");
}
```

To check if it's not null, you can use the `is_some()` method:

```rust
if stack.top.is_some() {
    println!("The stack is not empty");
} else {
    println!("The stack is empty");
}
```

Remember that you need to handle the `Option` properly when you want to access the value. You can use `match` or `if let` to do this.
