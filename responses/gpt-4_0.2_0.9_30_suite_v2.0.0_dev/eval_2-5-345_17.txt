This error is due to a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version (3.8.5) that comes with Spring Boot 2.7.0. IntelliJ IDEA has not yet been updated to support this version of Maven.

There are a few ways to solve this issue:

1. **Downgrade Maven version**: You can downgrade the Maven version in your project to a version that is compatible with IntelliJ IDEA. To do this, you need to modify the `pom.xml` file in your project and specify the Maven version in the `maven-wrapper.properties` file.

    ```xml
    <!-- pom.xml -->
    <properties>
        <maven.version>3.8.4</maven.version>
    </properties>
    ```

    ```properties
    # maven-wrapper.properties
    distributionUrl=https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.8.4/apache-maven-3.8.4-bin.zip
    ```

2. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: JetBrains regularly releases updates for IntelliJ IDEA that include fixes and improvements. You can check for updates by going to `Help > Check for Updates...` in the IntelliJ IDEA menu.

3. **Use an External Maven**: Instead of using the bundled Maven, you can configure IntelliJ IDEA to use an external Maven that is installed on your system. To do this, go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven` and specify the path to your Maven installation in the `Maven home directory` field.

Remember to reimport your project after making these changes.
