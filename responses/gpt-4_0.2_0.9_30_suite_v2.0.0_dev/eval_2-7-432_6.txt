The error you're seeing is due to Laravel's built-in CSRF protection. When you log out from one tab, the session is invalidated, and the CSRF token associated with the session becomes invalid as well. So, when you try to log out from the second tab, Laravel can't verify the CSRF token and throws a `419 Page Expired` error.

To handle this, you can catch the `TokenMismatchException` in your `Handler.php` file and redirect the user to the login page. Here's how you can do it:

```php
// app/Exceptions/Handler.php

public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof \Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException) {
        return redirect('/login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

This way, if a `TokenMismatchException` is thrown (which is what happens when a CSRF token is invalid), the user will be redirected to the login page instead of seeing the `419 Page Expired` error.

Please note that this solution assumes that your login route is `/login`. If it's different, you should adjust the redirect route accordingly.
