Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a traditional RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` tool. Here's how:

1. Convert OpenSSH private key to RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will ask for your passphrase (if any), and then it will write the RSA private key out directly over the existing file. The `-p` option tells `ssh-keygen` to change the passphrase of a private key file, the `-m PEM` option specifies the output format and the `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file.

2. You don't need to convert your public key. The public key will work with both OpenSSH and RSA private keys. The public key doesn't have a header like the private key, so you don't need to worry about it.

Please make sure to backup your keys before running these commands.
