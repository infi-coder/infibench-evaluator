Here is the implementation of the `my_2d_array` function:

```c++
std::vector<std::string> my_2d_array(int N, int M) {
    std::vector<std::string> A(N*M);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            A[i*M+j] = std::to_string(i) + std::to_string(j);
        }
    }
    return A;
}
```

This function creates a 1D vector of strings `A` with size `N*M`. It then fills each element of the vector with a string representing its position in a 2D array of size `N*M`. The position is represented as a string of two digits, where the first digit is the row index and the second digit is the column index. The function finally returns the filled vector.
