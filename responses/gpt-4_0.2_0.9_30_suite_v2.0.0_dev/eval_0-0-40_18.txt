The issue you are facing is due to the conflict between the Node.js installed in your Windows system and the Node.js installed in your WSL2: Ubuntu 20.04.

When you run the `npm -v` command, it's trying to execute the npm installed in your Windows system (`/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/npm`) which will not work in the WSL2 environment.

To solve this issue, you need to remove the Windows system paths from the WSL2 environment. You can do this by editing the `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file in your home directory.

Open the `.bashrc` file:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Add the following lines at the end of the file:

```bash
# remove /mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs from PATH
export PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed -e 's/:\/mnt\/c\/Program Files\/nodejs//g')
```

Save the file and exit. Then, source the `.bashrc` file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, when you run `npm -v`, it should execute the npm installed in your WSL2: Ubuntu 20.04.

If you still face the issue, you might need to reinstall `nodejs` and `npm` in your WSL2 environment:

```bash
sudo apt-get purge nodejs npm
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

This will install Node.js v14.x which comes with npm. You can replace `14.x` with your desired version.
