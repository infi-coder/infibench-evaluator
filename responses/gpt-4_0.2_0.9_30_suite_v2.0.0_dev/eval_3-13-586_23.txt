The error message is indicating that starting from Android 12 (API level 31), you must specify either `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` or `FLAG_MUTABLE` when creating a `PendingIntent`. 

The `MediaSessionCompat` class in the AndroidX Media library version 1.4.0 should handle this requirement. However, it seems like there's an issue with the library itself, as it's using `Build.VERSION.CODENAME` to check the Android version, which is not a reliable way to do so.

This issue has been fixed in the AndroidX Media library version 1.4.3. So, you should update your library version to 1.4.3 or higher.

In your `build.gradle` file, update the version of the media library:

```gradle
implementation 'androidx.media:media:1.4.3'
```

After updating the library, sync your project and try again. The issue should be resolved.
