Yes, you are correct. As of Spring 4.3, if a class has only one constructor, the `@Autowired` annotation is no longer necessary. Spring will use that constructor automatically for dependency injection.

However, if there are multiple constructors, Spring won't know which one to use, so you still need to use `@Autowired` to indicate the constructor for dependency injection.

The reason why some people still use `@Autowired` on a single constructor could be due to habit, or to explicitly show that the constructor is used for autowiring, which can make the code easier to understand for people who are not familiar with this feature of Spring 4.3+.
