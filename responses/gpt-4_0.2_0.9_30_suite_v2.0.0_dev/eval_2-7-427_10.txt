For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the public directory of your Laravel application. Misconfiguration could lead to issues with session handling.

2. **Cookie Configuration**: Check your `config/session.php` file. Ensure that the `domain` and `path` options are correctly set. If your application is on a subdomain, you might need to set the `domain` option to your root domain preceded by a dot, like so: `'.yourdomain.com'`.

3. **HTTPS**: If your application is served over HTTPS, ensure that the `secure` option in your `config/session.php` file is set to `true`.

4. **Middleware**: Ensure that the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is included in the `web` middleware group in your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

For the second issue, the error message suggests that there's an issue with the SSL version or the encryption method used. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Change Encryption Method**: Try changing `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` in your `.env` file from `ssl` to `tls`. Some servers do not support SSL, but do support TLS.

2. **Change Port**: If changing the encryption method doesn't work, try changing `MAIL_PORT` in your `.env` file from `587` to `465`. Port `465` is commonly used for SMTP over SSL.

3. **Contact Hosting Provider**: If the above steps don't work, you might need to contact your hosting provider or the email service provider. They might need to provide you with the correct SMTP settings or there could be a server-side issue that needs to be resolved.

Remember to clear your config cache by running `php artisan config:cache` after making changes to your `.env` file.
