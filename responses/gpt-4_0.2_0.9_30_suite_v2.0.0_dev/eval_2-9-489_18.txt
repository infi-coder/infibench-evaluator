The warning message is indicating that your Elasticsearch instance does not have security features enabled. This means that anyone can access your Elasticsearch instance without authentication.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Open your `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. This file is usually located in the `config` directory of your Elasticsearch installation.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

   ```yaml
   xpack.security.enabled: true
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
   ```

3. Save and close the file.

4. Restart Elasticsearch.

Please note that enabling security will require you to use a username and password when accessing Elasticsearch. The default username is `elastic`. To set the password, you can use the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` command-line tool that comes with Elasticsearch.

Here is how you can use it:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory where Elasticsearch is installed.

3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to set the passwords for the built-in users.

Remember to update your application's Elasticsearch client with the new username and password.

Also, please note that enabling transport security (with `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true`) will require you to configure SSL/TLS. If you don't want to do this, you can leave this setting out.

If you're using a version of Elasticsearch that doesn't come with X-Pack (like the OSS version), you won't be able to enable these security features. In that case, you should consider using a different method to secure your Elasticsearch instance, like running it behind a firewall or using a proxy that requires authentication.
