Your code is almost correct, but there are a few issues. 

1. You're trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you haven't declared them. You need to declare them using `Dim`.
2. You're trying to assign a `Range` object to `query`, but it seems like you want to assign the value of the cell. You should use `.Value` to get the value.
3. You're trying to assign the name of the active sheet to `currentSheet`, but you're not using it anywhere in your code. If you don't need it, you can remove it.
4. You're trying to use `query.Name` in your connection string, but `query` is a string, not an object, so it doesn't have a `Name` property. You should just use `query`.

Here's the corrected code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    With ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code will create a new query table in the active sheet, using the query from cell A1 of Sheet6. The results of the query will be placed in cell A1 of the "target" sheet.
