The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to use Flutter's engine before it's fully initialized. The `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` function requires Flutter's engine to be ready, as it needs to communicate with the platform side.

To fix this, you need to ensure that the engine is ready before calling `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`. You can do this by running your code inside `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

`WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` ensures that the Flutter engine is properly initialized before you try to use any platform channels (which is what `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` does under the hood).
