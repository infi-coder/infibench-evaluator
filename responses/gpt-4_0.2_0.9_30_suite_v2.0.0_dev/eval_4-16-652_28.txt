AWS CLI uses a pager program to handle its output. By default, it uses the `less` program. If you want to disable the pager, you can do so by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string.

You can do this in your current shell session by running:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

Or you can add the above line to your shell's initialization file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash) to make it permanent.

After doing this, your script should run without opening the pager:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

If you want to redirect the output to a file, you can do so by using the `>` operator:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > output.txt; 
done
```

This will write the output of each command to `output.txt`. If you want to append the output of each command to the file instead of overwriting it, you can use the `>>` operator:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo >> output.txt; 
done
```
