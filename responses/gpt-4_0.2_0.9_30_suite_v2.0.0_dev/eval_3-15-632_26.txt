Assuming that the data you want to split is separated by spaces, you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the data into an array and then assign the array elements to the columns. Here is how you can do it:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, " ") 'split the data by space
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0) 'first element
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1) 'second element
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2) 'third element
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3) 'fourth element
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4) 'fifth element
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```
Please adjust the indices of `splitData` and column letters according to your needs. This code assumes that there are exactly five elements after splitting the textline. If the number of elements can vary, you should add error checking to avoid out-of-bounds errors.
