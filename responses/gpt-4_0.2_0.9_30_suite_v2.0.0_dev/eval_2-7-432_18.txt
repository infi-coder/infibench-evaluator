The "419 Page Expired" error is due to Laravel's CSRF protection. When you log out in one tab, the session is invalidated, so the CSRF token in the other tab is no longer valid. When you try to log out in the other tab, Laravel cannot verify the CSRF token and throws a 419 error.

To handle this, you can catch the `TokenMismatchException` in your exception handler and redirect the user to the login page. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`.

2. Add `TokenMismatchException` to the top of the file:

```php
use Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException;
```

3. Add a new `render` method to the `Handler` class:

```php
public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof TokenMismatchException) {
        // Redirect to a form. Here is an example of how we can
        // redirect to the login form:
        return redirect('/login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

Now, if a `TokenMismatchException` is thrown (which is what happens when a CSRF token is invalid), the user will be redirected to the login page instead of seeing a 419 error page.

Remember, this is a workaround for your specific scenario. In general, it's important to handle CSRF protection properly to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
