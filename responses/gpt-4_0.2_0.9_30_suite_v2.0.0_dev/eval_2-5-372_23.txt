It seems like you are facing a version conflict issue. The `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations are part of the Bean Validation 2.0 specification, which is implemented by Hibernate Validator 6.0.0.Final and later versions. 

However, the log message indicates that Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final is being used, which does not support these annotations as they were not part of the Bean Validation 1.1 specification.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Explicitly add the Hibernate Validator dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

2. Exclude the Hibernate Validator from the Spring Boot Starter Web dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

3. If you are using JBoss, it might be using its own bundled version of Hibernate Validator. You can try to disable it by adding the following line to your `jboss-deployment-structure.xml` file:

```xml
<exclude-subsystems>
    <subsystem name="bean-validation"/>
</exclude-subsystems>
```

Remember to clean and rebuild your project after making these changes. If the problem persists, you might need to investigate further into your project's dependencies and configuration.
