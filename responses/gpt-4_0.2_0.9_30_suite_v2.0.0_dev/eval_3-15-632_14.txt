If the data you want to split is separated by a specific character, you can use the `Split` function in VBA. This function splits a string into a one-dimensional array based on a delimiter.

Here's how you can modify your code to split the data into 5 separate columns:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, " ") ' replace " " with your delimiter
    For i = 0 To 4 ' assuming you want to split into 5 columns
        ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G" + i).Value = splitData(i)
    Next i
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```
In this code, `" "` is the delimiter. Replace it with the character that separates your data. The loop will iterate over the first 5 elements of the array (0 to 4) and put each element in a separate column. If your data has more or less than 5 elements, adjust the loop accordingly.
