The error you're seeing is due to the fact that the pdftk package you're trying to use is not compatible with your version of macOS. This is a common issue on macOS Catalina and later versions because they dropped support for 32-bit applications, and the pdftk package you're trying to use is likely a 32-bit version.

Here's how you can solve this issue:

1. Uninstall the current pdftk package:

```bash
brew uninstall pdftk
```

2. Install pdftk-java, which is a reimplementation of pdftk in Java:

```bash
brew install pdftk-java
```

3. Create a symbolic link to pdftk-java:

```bash
ln -s /usr/local/bin/pdftk-java /usr/local/bin/pdftk
```

Now, you should be able to use pdftk as before. If you get a "permission denied" error when trying to create the symbolic link, you might need to run the command with sudo:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/pdftk-java /usr/local/bin/pdftk
```

Please note that you need to have Java installed on your machine to use pdftk-java. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using brew:

```bash
brew cask install java
```
