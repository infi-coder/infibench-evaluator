The error message you're seeing is due to a known issue with the way Java handles quotes in command line arguments. It's trying to interpret the embedded quotes in your command line argument and failing.

One way to solve this problem is to update your JDK to a version that has a fix for this issue. JDK 8u40 and later versions include a fix for this issue.

If you can't update your JDK, another workaround is to modify your command to avoid using embedded quotes. You can do this by setting the `JAVA_HOME` and `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variables separately, like this:

```bash
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.5
set MAVEN_OPTS=-DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path=C:\Program Files\NetBeans-11.1\netbeans\java\maven-nblib\netbeans-eventspy.jar -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
cd C:\projects\open
"C:\Program Files\NetBeans-11.1\netbeans\java\maven\bin\mvn.cmd" clean install
```

This way, you're not embedding any quotes in your command line arguments, which should avoid the issue.
