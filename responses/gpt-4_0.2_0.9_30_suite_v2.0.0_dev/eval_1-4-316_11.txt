The error you're seeing is because the `sort()` function in R doesn't work directly on lists. However, you can use the `unlist()` function to convert the list back to a vector, sort it, and then convert it back to a list if necessary.

Here is the function `mySort` you asked for:

```r
mySort <- function(l) {
  # Unlist the list to convert it to a vector
  unlisted_l <- unlist(l)
  
  # Sort the vector
  sorted_l <- sort(unlisted_l)
  
  # Convert the sorted vector back to a list
  sorted_list <- as.list(sorted_l)
  
  return(sorted_list)
}
```

You can use this function to sort your list as follows:

```r
sorted_list_text_data <- mySort(list_text_data)
```

This will return a list where the elements are sorted alphabetically.
