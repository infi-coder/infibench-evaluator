The error message you're seeing indicates that Go is unable to find the specified version of the module in your private repository. This could be due to a number of reasons, including network issues, incorrect configuration, or authentication problems.

Here are a few steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. **Check your network connection**: Make sure that you have a stable internet connection and that you're able to reach the repository from your current location.

2. **Verify the module version**: Ensure that the version of the module you're trying to fetch (v0.1.5 in this case) actually exists in your repository. You can do this by manually browsing the repository or using the `git` command line tool.

3. **Check your Go environment**: Use the `go env` command to print Go environment information. Look for the `GOPRIVATE` or `GONOPROXY` variables, which should include the paths to your private repositories. If they're not set, you can set them using the `go env -w GOPRIVATE=github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` command.

4. **Check your authentication**: If your repository is private, you'll need to authenticate with GitHub to access it. Make sure that your GitHub credentials are correctly configured on your machine. You can do this by running `git config --global --get user.name` and `git config --global --get user.email` to check your global Git configuration.

5. **Use verbose mode**: Run the `go get` command with the `-v` (verbose) flag to get more detailed output, which might help you identify the problem. For example: `go get -v github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client`.

6. **Clear your module cache**: Sometimes, issues can be caused by a corrupted module cache. You can clear your module cache by running `go clean -modcache`.

If none of these steps help, you might want to consider reaching out to your repository administrator or the Go community for further assistance.
