The error you're encountering is due to the fact that AWS Lambda expects a Linux binary, but you're building your Go application on a Windows machine, which produces a Windows binary.

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code to a Linux binary. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables before building your Go application.

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -o main main.go
```

This will produce a Linux binary named `main` from your `main.go` file.

Then, you need to zip this binary:

```bash
zip deployment.zip main
```

Now, you can upload the `deployment.zip` file to AWS Lambda.

Remember to set the handler name to `main` when you're configuring your Lambda function.

This should solve your issue. If you're still encountering problems, please let me know.
