The "419 Page Expired" error is due to Laravel's CSRF protection. When you log out from one tab, Laravel invalidates the session and the CSRF token associated with that session. When you try to log out from the other tab, Laravel can't find a valid CSRF token and throws a 419 error.

To handle this, you can catch the `TokenMismatchException` in your exception handler and redirect the user to the login page. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `App\Exceptions\Handler.php` file.

2. In the `render` method, add a check for `TokenMismatchException`:

```php
public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof \Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException) {
        return redirect('/login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

This will catch the `TokenMismatchException` and redirect the user to the login page, effectively logging them out.

Please note that this solution assumes that your login route is `/login`. If it's different, you should replace `'/login'` with your actual login route.

Also, please remember that this is a global exception handler. It will catch `TokenMismatchException` from all parts of your application, not just the logout action. If you want to handle this exception only for the logout action, you should add the check to your logout controller instead.
