Sure, here is the corrected version of your function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    result = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:] + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
        result.append(endString)
    return ' '.join(result)
```

This function splits the input text into words, then for each word, it moves the first character to the end, appends "ay", and adds the transformed word to the result list. Finally, it joins the words in the result list into a single string with spaces in between.
