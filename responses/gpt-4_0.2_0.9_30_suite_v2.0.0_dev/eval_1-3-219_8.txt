This issue might be due to a variety of reasons, but here are some steps you can try to resolve it:

1. **Check Python and Jupyter Installation**: Ensure that Python and Jupyter are correctly installed in your virtual environment. You can check this by activating your environment and running `python --version` and `jupyter --version`. If either command fails, you need to install the missing package.

2. **Reinstall ipykernel**: Sometimes, reinstalling ipykernel can solve the problem. You can do this by activating your environment and running `pip uninstall ipykernel` followed by `pip install ipykernel`.

3. **Check VS Code Python Interpreter**: Ensure that the Python interpreter selected in VS Code is the one from your virtual environment. You can check this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of VS Code and selecting the correct interpreter.

4. **Check Jupyter Server Logs**: If the above steps don't work, you can try to get more information about the problem from the Jupyter server logs. To do this, start Jupyter from the command line with `jupyter notebook` and see if any error messages appear.

5. **Update VS Code and Extensions**: Make sure that VS Code and all its extensions are up to date. You can check for updates by clicking on the gear icon in the bottom left corner of VS Code and selecting 'Check for Updates...'.

6. **Reinstall VS Code**: If all else fails, you can try to uninstall and reinstall VS Code. Before you do this, make sure to export your settings and extensions so you can easily restore them after the reinstall.

Remember to restart VS Code after each step to ensure that any changes take effect.
