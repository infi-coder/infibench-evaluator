For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the public directory of your Laravel application. Incorrect domain configuration could lead to issues with session management.

2. **Cookie Configuration**: Check your `config/session.php` file and ensure that the `domain` and `path` options are correctly set. If your application is on a subdomain, you might need to set the `domain` option to your root domain prefixed with a dot (e.g., `.yourdomain.com`).

3. **HTTPS**: If your application is served over HTTPS, ensure that the `secure` option in your `config/session.php` file is set to `true`.

4. **Middleware**: Ensure that the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is included in the `web` middleware group in your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

For the second issue, the error message suggests that there's an issue with the SSL version or the encryption method used. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Change Encryption Method**: Try changing the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` in your `.env` file from `ssl` to `tls`.

2. **Change Port**: If changing the encryption method doesn't work, you could try changing the `MAIL_PORT` in your `.env` file to `465` (which is typically used with `ssl`) or `25` (which is often used with no encryption).

3. **Disable Encryption**: If none of the above work, you could try disabling encryption altogether by setting `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` to `null` in your `.env` file. However, this is not recommended for production environments as it could expose sensitive information.

Remember to run `php artisan config:cache` after making changes to your `.env` file to clear the configuration cache.

If none of these suggestions work, you might need to contact your hosting provider or the email service provider for further assistance.
