The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server configuration. By default, Vite's development server only accepts connections from localhost for security reasons. This is why you're able to access it from within the Docker container (which is its own localhost), but not from outside.

To allow connections from outside the Docker container, you need to set the `host` option in the `server` configuration in your `vite.config.ts` file to `'0.0.0.0'`. This will allow connections from any IP address.

Here's how you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server from outside the Docker container.
