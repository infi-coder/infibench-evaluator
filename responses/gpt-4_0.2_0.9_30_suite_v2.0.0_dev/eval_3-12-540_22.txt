Yes, in Flutter you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here is an example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 2'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 3'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, `VerticalDivider` is used to draw vertical lines between three text widgets. You can customize the color and thickness of the line as per your requirements. 

Please note that `VerticalDivider` is a material design divider. A one logical pixel thick vertical line, with padding on either side. In the material design language, this represents a divider. Dividers can be used in lists, `Drawer`s, and elsewhere to separate content. 

To create a divider between list items, consider using `ListTile.divideTiles`, which is applied on a list of `ListTile`s.
