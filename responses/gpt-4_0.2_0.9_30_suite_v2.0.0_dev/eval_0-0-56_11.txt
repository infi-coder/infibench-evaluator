The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server only being accessible from the localhost by default. This is a security feature to prevent others from accessing your development server. However, when using Docker, the server needs to be accessible from outside the container.

To fix this, you need to set the `host` option in the Vite server configuration to `0.0.0.0`, which will make the server accessible from any IP address. Here's how you can do it:

Update your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0',
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

Now, when you run your Docker container and start the Vite server, it should be accessible from your host machine at `localhost:8080`.
