If the line you are reading contains multiple values separated by a delimiter (like a comma or a space), you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the line into an array and then assign the array elements to the cells. 

Here is an example of how you can do this:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim arr() As String
    arr = Split(textline, " ") ' Assuming space is the delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = arr(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = arr(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = arr(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = arr(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = arr(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

In this code, `Split` function is used to split `textline` into an array `arr` using space as the delimiter. Then, the elements of the array are assigned to the cells in columns G, H, I, J, and K. Please replace the delimiter (" ") with the actual delimiter in your text file.
