You can use the `.toast('show')` method to show the toast. Here is how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This code will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event like a button click, you can wrap the code inside an event handler. For example:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function() {
  $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

This code will show the toast when a button with the id `myButton` is clicked.

Also, make sure that you have included the Bootstrap JavaScript file in your HTML file. The toast component is a part of Bootstrap's JavaScript library, so it won't work if you have only included the CSS file. You can include it with a script tag like this:

```html
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Remember to include jQuery before Bootstrap's JavaScript, as Bootstrap's JavaScript depends on jQuery:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
```
