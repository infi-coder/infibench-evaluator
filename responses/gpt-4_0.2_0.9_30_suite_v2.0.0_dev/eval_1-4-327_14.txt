In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, it actually makes the column names unique by adding a suffix to the duplicate column names. So, in your case, the column names of `d3` would be `a` and `a.1`.

You can select the second column by its name as follows:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

If you want to keep the original column names, you should use a different data structure like a list of data frames. But if you stick with a single data frame, R will enforce unique column names.
