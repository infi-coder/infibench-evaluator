Sure, you can use the `last:` variant provided by Tailwind CSS to target the last element in a list. You can then use the `border-b-0` class to remove the bottom border from the last `<li>` element. Here is how you can do it:

```html
  <ul>
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      :class="{ 'border-b-0': index === items.length - 1, 'border-b border-black border-solid': index !== items.length - 1 }"
    >
      Item
    </li>
  </ul>
```

In this code, the `:class` directive is used to conditionally apply classes based on the current index of the loop. If the index is equal to the length of the items array minus 1 (which means it's the last item), the `border-b-0` class is applied to remove the bottom border. Otherwise, the `border-b border-black border-solid` classes are applied to add the bottom border.

Please note that you need to enable the `last` variant in your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) for the border utilities:

```js
module.exports = {
  variants: {
    extend: {
      borderColor: ['last'],
      borderWidth: ['last'],
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

This configuration will enable the `last:` variant for the `borderColor` and `borderWidth` utilities. After you've made these changes, you should be able to see the bottom border on all `<li>` elements except the last one.
