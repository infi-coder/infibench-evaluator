This error is caused by a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the version of Maven used in your project. The Maven version (3.8.5) that comes with Spring Boot 2.7 is not fully compatible with some versions of IntelliJ IDEA.

Here are a few ways to resolve this issue:

1. **Downgrade Maven version**: You can downgrade the Maven version in your project to a version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by changing the Maven version in the `pom.xml` file of your project.

2. **Upgrade IntelliJ IDEA**: You can upgrade your IntelliJ IDEA to the latest version. JetBrains regularly releases updates for IntelliJ IDEA to fix bugs and compatibility issues. You can download the latest version from the [official JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

3. **Use IntelliJ IDEA's Bundled Maven**: IntelliJ IDEA comes with a bundled Maven. You can configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the bundled Maven instead of the one specified in your project. To do this, go to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven`. Under `Maven home directory`, select the bundled Maven.

4. **Disable the Maven extension in IntelliJ IDEA**: If you're not using any specific features of the Maven integration in IntelliJ IDEA, you can disable the Maven extension. To do this, go to `File -> Settings -> Plugins`, find the Maven extension, and disable it.

Remember to restart IntelliJ IDEA after making these changes to ensure they take effect.
