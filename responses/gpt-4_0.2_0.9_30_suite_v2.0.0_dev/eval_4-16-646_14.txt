The error message `bad CPU type in executable` usually means that the executable file you're trying to run is not compatible with the architecture of your CPU. This is a common issue on MacOS Catalina because it dropped support for 32-bit applications.

The `pdftk` tool is a 32-bit application, so it won't run on MacOS Catalina or later versions. However, there is a workaround for this issue. You can use `pdftk-java`, which is a port of pdftk to java.

Here are the steps to install `pdftk-java` on MacOS Catalina:

1. First, you need to install Homebrew if you haven't already. Open Terminal and paste the following command:

```markdown
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install `pdftk-java` by running:

```markdown
brew install pdftk-java
```

3. After the installation, you can use `pdftk-java` just like `pdftk`. However, you need to type `pdftk-java` instead of `pdftk` in your commands.

For example, if you previously used a command like this:

```markdown
pdftk input.pdf output output.pdf
```

You should now use:

```markdown
pdftk-java input.pdf output output.pdf
```

If you want to keep using `pdftk` instead of `pdftk-java` for your commands, you can create a symbolic link:

```markdown
ln -s /usr/local/bin/pdftk-java /usr/local/bin/pdftk
```

Now, you can use `pdftk` in your commands as before.
