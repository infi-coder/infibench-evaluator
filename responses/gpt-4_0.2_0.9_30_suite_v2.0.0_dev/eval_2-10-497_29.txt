In Rust, `Box<T>` is a smart pointer that points to data on the heap. It cannot be null. If you want to have an optional `Box<T>`, you can use `Option<Box<T>>`. This will allow you to have a `None` value, which is similar to a null pointer in other languages.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

To check if the `Box<Node>` is `None`, you can use the `is_none()` method:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    // The stack is empty
}
```

To check if it's `Some`, you can use the `is_some()` method:

```rust
if stack.top.is_some() {
    // The stack is not empty
}
```

You can also use pattern matching to check the value and handle it:

```rust
match stack.top {
    Some(node) => {
        // The stack is not empty, do something with node
    },
    None => {
        // The stack is empty
    }
}
```
