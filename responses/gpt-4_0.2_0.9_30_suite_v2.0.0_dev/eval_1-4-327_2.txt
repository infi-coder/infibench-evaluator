In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, it actually modifies the column names to make them unique. The column names of the resulting data frame are made unique by appending a suffix. 

In your case, the column names of the resulting data frame `d3` would be `a` and `a.1`. So, to select the second column by name, you can use `d3$a.1`.

Here is the code:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

This will assign the values of the second column to the variable `second_col`.
