AWS CLI version 2 introduced automatic paging for commands that return multiple pages of output. However, this feature can be disabled by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string.

You can disable the pager for a single command by prefixing your command with `AWS_PAGER=""`. Here's how you can modify your bash script:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  AWS_PAGER="" aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

If you want to disable the pager for all AWS CLI commands in your current shell session, you can export the `AWS_PAGER` variable:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

To disable the pager permanently, you can add the export command to your shell's profile script (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash, `~/.zshrc` for zsh):

```bash
echo 'export AWS_PAGER=""' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Then, source the profile script to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

This will prevent the AWS CLI from opening an interactive pager for command output.
