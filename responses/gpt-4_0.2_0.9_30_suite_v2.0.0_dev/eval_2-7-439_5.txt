The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. You cannot install it via Composer. 

The `ext-zip` extension is used for zip archives. If you're on a Unix-like system, you can install it via `pecl`:

```bash
pecl install zip
```

And then add `extension=zip.so` to your `php.ini` file.

If you're on Windows, you can enable it by uncommenting or adding the line `extension=php_zip.dll` in your `php.ini` file. The `php_zip.dll` and `php_pdo.dll` DLLs must be present in your PHP installation. If not, you need to download them.

After installing or enabling the extension, you can tell Composer that it's installed by adding it to the `require` section of your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1.3",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer update`.

Remember to restart your web server after making these changes.
