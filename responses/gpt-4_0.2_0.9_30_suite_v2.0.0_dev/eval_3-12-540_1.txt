Yes, Flutter provides a widget called `VerticalDivider` to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here is an example of how to use it:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line is drawn between two text components. You can customize the color, thickness, and width of the line by using the respective properties. 

Note: The `VerticalDivider` is a widget that displays a vertical line with a customizable height, thickness, and color. It's often used in a `Row` to separate widgets vertically.
