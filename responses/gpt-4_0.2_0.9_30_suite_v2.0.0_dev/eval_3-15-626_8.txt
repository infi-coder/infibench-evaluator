Your code is almost correct, but there are a few issues. 

First, you are trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you haven't declared them. 

Second, you are trying to use `query` as both a string (when you assign it the value of a cell) and as a `WorkbookQuery` object (when you use `query.Name`). 

Third, you are assigning `currentSheet` the name of the active sheet, but you never use it.

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Assign the query string from a cell
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Assign the active sheet to currentSheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Add a QueryTable to the active sheet
    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code should work assuming that the query string in `Sheet6` cell `A1` is a valid Power Query query.
