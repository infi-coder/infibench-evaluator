Sure, you are getting the error because you are trying to instantiate an object, not a class. You need to return a function that returns an object in your mock, like so:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

This way, when you call `new API()`, it will return the mocked object.
