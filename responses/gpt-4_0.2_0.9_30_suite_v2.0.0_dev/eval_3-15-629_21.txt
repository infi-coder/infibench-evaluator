You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. Here's a simple function to copy text to the clipboard:

```vba
Sub CopyTextToClipboard(sText As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText sText
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
End Sub
```

You can use this function like this:

```vba
CopyTextToClipboard Me.NodeKey.Value
```

Please note that you need to add a reference to `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library` to use `MSForms.DataObject`. You can do this by going to `Tools -> References` in the VBA editor, and then checking `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library`.

If you can't find `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library`, you can add it manually. The file is usually located in `C:\Windows\System32\FM20.dll` or `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\FM20.dll`.
