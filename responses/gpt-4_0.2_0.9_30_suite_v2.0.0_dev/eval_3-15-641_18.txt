Unfortunately, Excel VBA doesn't have a built-in function to directly retrieve the local path of a OneDrive or SharePoint file. However, you can use a workaround to get the local path of the synced SharePoint folder.

Here's a simple VBA function that retrieves the local path of a file:

```vba
Function GetLocalPath(OneDrivePath As String) As String
    Dim fso As Object
    Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    GetLocalPath = fso.GetAbsolutePathName(OneDrivePath)
End Function
```

You can use this function in your code like this:

```vba
Sub Test()
    Dim OneDrivePath As String
    Dim LocalPath As String

    OneDrivePath = ThisWorkbook.Path
    LocalPath = GetLocalPath(OneDrivePath)

    MsgBox LocalPath
End Sub
```

This will display a message box with the local path of the workbook.

Please note that this will only work if the SharePoint folder is synced locally. If the folder is not synced, the function will return an error.

Also, the local path will depend on where each user has set up their OneDrive folder to sync. If users have different sync settings, they will get different local paths.

As for creating folders and files on SharePoint using VBA, you might want to consider using the SharePoint REST API or the Microsoft Graph API. These APIs allow you to interact with SharePoint programmatically, but they require a good understanding of HTTP requests and JSON.
