The error you're seeing is because you're trying to access platform channels before `runApp()` has been called. This is a common issue when trying to perform asynchronous operations in the `main()` function.

To fix this, you should ensure that `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` is called first. This method initializes the binding between the framework and the Flutter engine.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This should resolve the error you're seeing.
