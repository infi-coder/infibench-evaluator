You can disable the ordering of includes in clang-format by setting the `SortIncludes` option to `false` in your `.clang-format` configuration file.

Here is an example of how to do it:

```yaml
---
Language:        Cpp
# BasedOnStyle:  Google
SortIncludes:    false
...
```

This configuration will prevent clang-format from sorting your `#include` directives.
