The `rename` function is used to rename the columns or index of a DataFrame. However, in your case, you are trying to rename the Series returned by the `mean` function, which does not have a `columns` attribute. 

Here is how you can achieve your goal:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg = avg.rename(columns = {"p":"mean"})
    return avg
```

In this function, `df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean()` will return a Series with "t" as index and the mean of "p" as values. `reset_index()` is used to convert the index "t" into a column, and then `rename` is used to rename the column "p" to "mean". 

You can use this function like this:

```python
datain = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5],[1,3,4,5,6],[2,4,5,6,7],[2,5,6,7,8]])
df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])
print(renameDataFrame(df))
```

This will output:

```
   t  mean
0  1   2.5
1  2   4.5
```

This shows the mean of "p" grouped by "t".
