It seems like there's a bit of confusion here. iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" that you can enable or disable like Android. However, there are a few things that might be causing the issue you're experiencing.

1. **Trust the Developer Certificate**: If you're trying to install an app that's not from the App Store, you'll need to trust the developer certificate on your device. Here's how:

    - Go to Settings > General > Profiles or Profiles & Device Management. 
    - Under the "Enterprise App" heading, you see a profile for the developer.
    - Tap the name of the developer profile under the Enterprise App heading to establish trust for this developer.
    - Then you see a prompt to confirm your choice.

2. **Use a Paid Developer Account**: If you're trying to install your own app on your device, you'll need a paid Apple Developer account. The free account only lets you install your app for 7 days before you have to reinstall it.

3. **Update Your Device**: Make sure your device is updated to the latest version of iOS. Some apps require the latest software to work correctly.

4. **Use TestFlight**: If you're trying to test an app, consider using TestFlight. It's Apple's official way of beta testing your app before it's released on the App Store.

If none of these solutions work, the issue might be with the app itself. You might need to contact the developer for more information.
