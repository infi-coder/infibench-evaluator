You can use the `.toast('show')` method to show the toast. Here's how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast when a certain event happens (like clicking a button), you can put the above code inside an event handler. For example:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function() {
  $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

This will show the toast when a button with the id `myButton` is clicked.

Also, make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML file. The toast component requires the Bootstrap's JavaScript file to work properly. Here's an example of how to include them:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Please replace the version numbers with the ones you are using.
