Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. You need to declare your variables (`query` and `currentSheet`) with their data types.
2. `query` should be a `WorkbookQuery` object, not a string.
3. `currentSheet` should be a `Worksheet` object, not a string.
4. You're trying to use `query.Name` as a string, but `query` is a string, not a `WorkbookQuery` object.
5. You're trying to use `ActiveSheet.Name` as a `Worksheet` object, but it's a string.

Here's a revised version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As WorkbookQuery
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Set the query to the query in the workbook
    Set query = ThisWorkbook.Queries("YourQueryName") ' Replace "YourQueryName" with the name of your query

    ' Set the currentSheet to the active sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Add a new ListObject with a QueryTable that uses the query
    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query.Name _
        , Destination:=Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query.Name & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code assumes that you have a Power Query query named "YourQueryName" in your workbook. Replace "YourQueryName" with the actual name of your query.
