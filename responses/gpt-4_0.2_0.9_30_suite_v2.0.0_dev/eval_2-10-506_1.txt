You can use the `iter()` method to create an iterator over the vector, and then use the `min()` method to find the minimum value. Here is how you can do it:

```rust
let v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
let min = v.iter().min();

match min {
    Some(min) => println!("The minimum value is {}", min),
    None => println!("The vector is empty"),
}
```

In this code, `v.iter().min()` returns an `Option<&i32>`. If the vector is empty, `min()` returns `None`, otherwise it returns `Some(&min_value)`. The `match` statement is used to handle both cases.

Please note that `min()` returns a reference to the minimum value, not the value itself. If you want to get the value, you can dereference it using `*`. But be careful, you should only dereference it when you are sure that the `Option` is `Some`, not `None`.
