The error you're getting is because you're trying to overwrite the `$theme-colors` map after it's already been used in the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file. 

You should define your custom colors before importing the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file. Also, you should import `_functions.scss` before defining your custom colors because it contains the `map-loop` function which is used in `_variables.scss`.

Here is the revised code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color,
  // Add other colors if needed
);
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Replace `#your-color` with the color you want to use for the `primary` color. If you want to change other colors, you can add them to the `$theme-colors` map.

Please note that you need to have the correct path to the Bootstrap's SCSS files in your `node_modules` directory. If the path is incorrect, you will get a file not found error.
