The issue you're encountering is likely due to the fact that Vite's server is only listening on `localhost` (127.0.0.1) inside the Docker container. This means it's not accessible from outside the container, even though the port is exposed.

You can solve this by configuring Vite to listen on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0). You can do this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, which should allow you to access the server from outside the Docker container. 

Remember to rebuild your Docker image after making this change, as the change needs to be included in the image that's used to create the container. You can do this by running `docker-compose build` before you start the container.
