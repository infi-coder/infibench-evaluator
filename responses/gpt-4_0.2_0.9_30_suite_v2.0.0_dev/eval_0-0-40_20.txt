The error message you're seeing is due to a conflict between the Node.js and npm installations on your Windows system and the Ubuntu system in WSL2. The Ubuntu system is trying to use the npm executable from the Windows system, which doesn't work because of differences in the way Windows and Linux handle executable files.

To solve this problem, you need to remove the Windows PATH from the Ubuntu system in WSL2. You can do this by editing the `.bashrc` file in your home directory.

1. Open the `.bashrc` file in a text editor. If you're using the nano text editor, you can do this by running the command `nano ~/.bashrc`.

2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:

    ```bash
    # remove /mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs from PATH
    export PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed -e 's/:\/mnt\/c\/Program Files\/nodejs//')
    ```

3. Save the file and exit the text editor. If you're using nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

4. Close the terminal and open a new one to apply the changes.

5. Verify that the problem is solved by running the command `npm -v`. You should see the version number of npm without any error messages.

If you still see the same error, it means that the Windows PATH is still in the Ubuntu system. In this case, you can try to remove the Windows PATH from the Ubuntu system manually by running the command `export PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed -e 's/:\/mnt\/c\/Program Files\/nodejs//')` in the terminal. After running this command, try to run the command `npm -v` again.
