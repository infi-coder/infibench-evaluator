Sure, I can help with that. The problem with your current code is that it checks if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, not if each individual character is in `correct`. 

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)
```

This function uses the `all()` function to check if all characters in the input string are in the `correct` string. If all characters are in `correct`, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
