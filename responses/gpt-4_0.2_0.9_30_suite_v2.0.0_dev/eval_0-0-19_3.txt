The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` could not be found in the npm registry. This is because the package does not exist with that exact name.

If you're trying to install the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js, the correct package name is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`.

Try running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save aws-sdk
```

This will install the AWS SDK for JavaScript and add it to your project's `package.json` file.
