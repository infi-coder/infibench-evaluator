Font Awesome 5 has a few changes compared to Font Awesome 4. The main change is that the icons are now separated into different styles: Solid, Regular, Light, Duotone, and Brands. 

Each style has a different font-family: `Font Awesome 5 Free` for Solid and Regular, `Font Awesome 5 Brands` for Brands, and `Font Awesome 5 Pro` for Light and Duotone (Pro version only).

The `content` value for the icons has also changed in Font Awesome 5. You can find the correct value for each icon in the Font Awesome 5 cheatsheet.

Here is how you can update your CSS for Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* Update the font-family */
  font-weight: 900; /* Add font-weight for Solid style */
}
```

In this example, I used the Solid style (`font-weight: 900`). If you want to use the Regular style, you should use `font-weight: 400`.

Also, make sure you have included the correct Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project.
