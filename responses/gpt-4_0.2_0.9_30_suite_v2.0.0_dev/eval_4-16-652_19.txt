AWS CLI uses a pager program to handle its output. By default, it uses the `less` program. You can disable the pager by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string.

You can do this in your bash script like so:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will disable the pager for the duration of the script. If you want to disable it permanently, you can add the `export AWS_PAGER=""` line to your shell profile file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash).

Alternatively, if you want to pipe the output to a file, you can do so using the `>` operator:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > output.txt; 
done
```

This will write the output of each command to `output.txt`, overwriting the file each time. If you want to append to the file instead, use `>>`:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo >> output.txt; 
done
```
