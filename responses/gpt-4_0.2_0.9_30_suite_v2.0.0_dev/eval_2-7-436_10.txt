The error message indicates that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are the steps you can take to solve this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP version 7.3 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    php -v
    ```
    If your PHP version is lower than 7.3, you need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires several PHP extensions. You can check your installed extensions by running:

    ```bash
    php -m
    ```
    The required extensions are: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, and XML. If any of these are missing, you need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Make sure you have the latest version of Composer. You can check your Composer version by running:

    ```bash
    composer --version
    ```
    If your Composer version is not up-to-date, you can update it by running:

    ```bash
    composer self-update
    ```

4. **Check Laravel 9 availability**: At the time of writing, Laravel 9 has not been released yet. The latest stable version is Laravel 8. You can check the available versions of Laravel by visiting the [Packagist website](https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/laravel).

If you have checked all these points and everything is in order, you should be able to install Laravel without any issues. If the problem persists, please provide more details about your environment (OS, PHP version, installed PHP extensions, Composer version) for further assistance.
