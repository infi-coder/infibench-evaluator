The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. You cannot install it via Composer. The `ext-zip` extension is used to read, write and process zip archives in PHP.

Here's how you can install it:

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

**On CentOS/RHEL:**

```bash
sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
```

**On Windows:**

1. Open your `php.ini` file.
2. Search for `extension=php_zip.dll`.
3. If this line is commented (i.e., if it starts with a `;`), then remove the `;` to uncomment it.
4. If you can't find this line, add it at the end of the file.
5. Save and close the `php.ini` file.
6. Restart your web server.

After installing the extension, you can check if it's enabled by running:

```bash
php -m | grep zip
```

If the `zip` extension is enabled, this command will output `zip`.

After you've installed the `ext-zip` extension, you can tell Composer that it's installed by adding it to the `require` section of your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer install` again.
