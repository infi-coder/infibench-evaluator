It seems like you're trying to programmatically retrieve the local path of a file that is synced with OneDrive/SharePoint. Unfortunately, Excel VBA doesn't provide a direct way to retrieve the local path of a file stored on OneDrive/SharePoint. 

However, you can try the following workaround:

1. **Use the `Environ` function**: This function can return the local path of the OneDrive folder. You can then append the relative path of your file to this path. Here's an example:

```vba
Dim OneDrivePath As String
OneDrivePath = Environ("OneDrive")
```

2. **Use the `Application.ThisWorkbook.Path` property**: This property returns the path of the workbook that contains the macro code. If the workbook is stored in a OneDrive folder, the returned path will be the local path. However, this will only work if the workbook containing the macro is in the same folder as the file you're interested in.

```vba
Dim WorkbookPath As String
WorkbookPath = Application.ThisWorkbook.Path
```

Remember that these methods will only work if the OneDrive/SharePoint files are synced locally. If the files are not synced, you'll need to use the SharePoint API or a similar tool to interact with the files.
