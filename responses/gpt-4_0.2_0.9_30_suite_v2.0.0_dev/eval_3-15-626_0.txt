The code you provided has some issues. Here's a corrected version:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Get the query from a cell in Sheet6
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Get the current active sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Create a new ListObject with a QueryTable that uses the Power Query connection string
    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = True
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This script assumes that the query string stored in cell A1 of Sheet6 is a valid Power Query query. It creates a new ListObject in the active sheet, starting at cell A1, and populates it with the results of the query.

Please note that automating Power Query with VBA is not officially supported by Microsoft, and this method may not work in all cases.
