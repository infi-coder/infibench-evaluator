This issue might be due to a variety of reasons. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot:

1. **Check the Python Interpreter**: Make sure you have selected the correct Python interpreter in VS Code. You can do this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of the status bar or by using the `Python: Select Interpreter` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

2. **Check the Jupyter Server**: Try to start the Jupyter server manually from the command line using the same Python interpreter. You can do this by activating your conda environment and running `jupyter notebook`. If this works, it means the issue is likely with VS Code.

3. **Check the Python Extension**: Make sure you have the latest version of the Python extension for VS Code. You can check this by going to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) and searching for `Python`.

4. **Reinstall Jupyter**: Try reinstalling Jupyter in your conda environment. You can do this by activating your environment and running `conda install jupyter`.

5. **Check the VS Code Settings**: Check your VS Code settings (`File > Preferences > Settings` or `Ctrl+,`) for any settings related to Jupyter or Python that might be causing the issue.

6. **Check the Error Log**: If none of the above steps work, check the error log in VS Code for any additional information about the issue. You can view the error log by going to `View > Output` and selecting `Python` in the dropdown menu.

If none of these steps work, you might want to consider submitting an issue on the VS Code GitHub page or reaching out to the VS Code community for further assistance.
