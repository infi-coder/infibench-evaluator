The error message is indicating that the `$theme-colors` map is not a valid CSS value. This is because you are trying to overwrite the `$theme-colors` map after it has already been used in the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file.

To fix this issue, you should define your custom `$theme-colors` map before importing the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file. However, you should not import the `_variables.scss` file directly, instead, import the `bootstrap.scss` file which will import all necessary files in the correct order.

Here is how you should structure your SCSS file:

```scss
// Define your custom theme colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color, // replace #your-color with your desired color
  // Add other colors if needed
);

// Import Bootstrap
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

In this way, your custom `$theme-colors` map will be used when compiling the Bootstrap SCSS files.

Please replace `#your-color` with the color you want to use for the primary color. You can add more color definitions to the `$theme-colors` map if you want to customize other colors as well.
