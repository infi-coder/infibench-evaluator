In Rust, you can't have null pointers like in C or C++. Instead, Rust uses the `Option` type to represent a value that could be `None` (similar to null in other languages) or `Some(value)`.

You should use `Option<Box<Node>>` for the `next` field in `Node` and the `top` field in `Stack`. Here is how you can do it:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

Now, you can check if `next` or `top` is `None` like this:

```rust
if let Some(node) = &self.top {
    // The top is not None, do something with node
} else {
    // The top is None
}
```

Or you can use `is_none()` or `is_some()` methods:

```rust
if self.top.is_none() {
    // The top is None
}

if self.top.is_some() {
    // The top is not None
}
```

Remember, in Rust, you don't need to manually deallocate `Box`es. When they go out of scope, they are automatically deallocated. This prevents many common bugs such as null pointer dereferencing, double free, etc.
