You can sort a list of characters in R using the `sort()` function. However, the error you're encountering is because you're trying to sort a list of lists. Each element of your list is itself a list, which is why the `sort()` function is failing.

Here's how you can define the `mySort` function:

```r
mySort <- function(l) {
  # Unlist the list to create a vector
  unlisted_l <- unlist(l)
  
  # Sort the vector
  sorted_l <- sort(unlisted_l)
  
  # Convert the sorted vector back to a list
  sorted_list <- as.list(sorted_l)
  
  return(sorted_list)
}
```

You can use this function to sort your list as follows:

```r
sorted_list_text_data <- mySort(list_text_data)
```

This function works by first converting the list to a vector using `unlist()`, sorting the vector, and then converting the sorted vector back to a list.
