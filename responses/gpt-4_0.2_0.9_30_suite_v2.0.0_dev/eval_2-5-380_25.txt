The issue you're facing might be due to the change in the default URL for Swagger UI. In the newer versions of springdoc-openapi-ui, the Swagger UI is not available at `/swagger-ui.html` anymore. Instead, it's available at `/swagger-ui/index.html`.

So, try accessing Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html` or `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/`.

If you still want to use the old URL, you can add the following property to your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

For `application.properties`:

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui.html
```

For `application.yml`:

```yaml
springdoc:
  swagger-ui:
    path: /swagger-ui.html
```

This will make Swagger UI available at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

Also, make sure that you have the necessary configuration to enable Swagger. If you don't have it, you can add the following configuration class to your project:

```java
@Configuration
public class OpenApiConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public OpenAPI customOpenAPI() {
        return new OpenAPI()
                .info(new Info()
                        .title("My API")
                        .version("1.0")
                        .description("This is a sample Spring Boot RESTful service using springdoc-openapi and OpenAPI 3."));
    }
}
```

This will create a basic Swagger documentation for your API. You can customize it according to your needs.
