The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server only being accessible from the localhost by default. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to your development server.

However, in a Docker context, you need to make the server accessible from outside the container. You can do this by setting the `host` option in the Vite server configuration to `'0.0.0.0'`. This will allow the server to accept connections from any IP address.

Here's how you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server from outside the Docker container.
