The error message you're seeing is because the `to-rgb` function is trying to convert a map to an RGB value, which is not valid. 

The `to-rgb` function expects a color value, not a map. The `$theme-colors` variable is a map where each key is a string representing the name of the color (like "primary", "secondary", etc.) and each value is the actual color.

To fix this issue, you should define your custom colors before importing the Bootstrap SCSS files. Also, you should not import the `variables.scss` file directly, because it will cause the default Bootstrap variables to be loaded before your custom variables, which will prevent your custom variables from being used.

Here is the revised code:

```scss
// Define your custom colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here
);

// Import Bootstrap
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Replace `#your-color-here` with the color you want to use for the "primary" color. You can add more colors to the `$theme-colors` map if you want to customize other colors as well.

After making these changes, you should be able to compile your SCSS file without any errors.
