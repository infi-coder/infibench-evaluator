The `Get-Service` cmdlet does not provide the description of the service. However, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to get the description of the service. Here is an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service" | Select-Object Name, Description | Out-GridView
```

This will give you a list of all services with their names and descriptions.

If you want to get the description of a specific service, you can use the following command:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service Where Name = 'YourServiceName'" | Select-Object Name, Description
```

Replace `'YourServiceName'` with the name of the service you want to get the description for.
