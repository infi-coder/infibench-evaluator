Font Awesome 5 has made some changes to the way it is used compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is no longer just "FontAwesome", it's now separated into different styles: "Font Awesome 5 Free", "Font Awesome 5 Brands", and "Font Awesome 5 Pro". The `content` values have also changed for some icons.

In addition, for the free version of Font Awesome 5, you need to specify the font-weight because solid (`fas`) icons have a font-weight of 900 and regular (`far`) icons have a font-weight of 400.

Here's how you can update your CSS for Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* Update the font-family */
  font-weight: 900; /* Add font-weight for Font Awesome 5 */
}
```

Please make sure that the Unicode (`\f107`) you are using is correct for the icon you want to display in Font Awesome 5. Some icons have different Unicode in Font Awesome 5 compared to Font Awesome 4. You can check the correct Unicode for your icon in the Font Awesome 5 icon gallery.
