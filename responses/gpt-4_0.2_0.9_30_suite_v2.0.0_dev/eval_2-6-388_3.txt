The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It's part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

You need to install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational` package to have access to it. 

You can install it via NuGet Package Manager:

```shell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational
```

Or via .NET CLI:

```shell
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational
```

After installing the package, you can use the `[Keyless]` attribute by adding the following using directive to your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Then you can define your model as keyless:

```csharp
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    // Other properties...
}
```

And in your `DbContext`:

```csharp
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

Now you can use `_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)` without having to add a primary key to your model.
