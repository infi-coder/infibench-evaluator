The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP version 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    php -v
    ```
    If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, and XML. You can check your installed extensions by running:

    ```bash
    php -m
    ```
    If any of the required extensions are missing, you'll need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Although you've mentioned that you have updated Composer to version 2.3.10, it's worth double-checking. You can check your Composer version by running:

    ```bash
    composer --version
    ```
    If your Composer version is not up-to-date, you can update it with the following command:

    ```bash
    composer self-update
    ```

4. **Try specifying the exact Laravel version**: Instead of using "9.*" in your command, try specifying the exact version of Laravel 9 that you want to install. For example:

    ```bash
    composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.0.*"
    ```

After ensuring all these requirements are met, try running the `composer create-project` command again. If you're still encountering issues, there might be a problem with your Composer's cache. You can clear it with the following command:

```bash
composer clear-cache
```
