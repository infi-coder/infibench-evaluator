Yes, you can disable the generation of the `*-plain.jar` file. This file is generated by the `bootJar` task in Spring Boot 2.5.0. You can disable it by adding the following configuration to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will prevent the generation of the `*-plain.jar` file. However, please note that this will also disable the generation of the executable `*.jar` file. If you want to keep the executable `*.jar` file and only remove the `*-plain.jar` file, you can do this:

```groovy
tasks.named('jar').configure {
    enabled = true
}

tasks.named('bootJar').configure {
    classifier = 'boot'
}
```

This will generate only the executable `*.jar` file with a `-boot` classifier.
