The problem you're experiencing is due to the fact that WSL2 is trying to use the Windows version of npm, which is not compatible with the Linux environment. 

To solve this issue, you need to remove the Windows PATH from the WSL2 environment. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your bash profile file with a text editor. You can use nano for this:

    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:

    ```bash
    export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"
    ```

3. Save and close the file. If you're using nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y` to confirm, and finally `Enter` to save.

4. Update your system variables with the new PATH:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

5. Now, you should be able to use npm without any issues. Check the version of npm:

    ```bash
    npm -v
    ```

If you still encounter issues, you may need to reinstall nodejs and npm in your WSL2 environment. Here's how you can do it:

1. Uninstall nodejs and npm:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get purge nodejs npm
    ```

2. Update your package list:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

3. Reinstall nodejs and npm:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
    ```

4. Check the versions of nodejs and npm:

    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

This should solve your problem and allow you to use npm in your WSL2 environment.
