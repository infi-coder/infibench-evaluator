There could be several reasons why you are unable to start a Jupyter notebook on VS Code. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot:

1. **Check your Python interpreter**: Make sure you have selected the correct Python interpreter for your Jupyter notebook. You can do this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of the VS Code status bar and selecting the interpreter that corresponds to your 'da38' environment.

2. **Check your Jupyter and ipykernel installation**: Make sure you have Jupyter and ipykernel installed in your 'da38' environment. You can do this by activating your environment in the terminal and running `conda list`. If you don't see Jupyter and ipykernel in the list, you can install them by running `conda install jupyter ipykernel`.

3. **Reinstall the Python extension**: There might be an issue with your Python extension. Try uninstalling and reinstalling it.

4. **Check your VS Code settings**: There might be a problem with your VS Code settings. You can reset your settings by going to File > Preferences > Settings and searching for 'Python'. Click on 'Edit in settings.json' and make sure the Python path is correct.

5. **Check your firewall settings**: If you are using a firewall, it might be blocking the connection to the Jupyter server. Try disabling your firewall temporarily to see if that solves the problem.

6. **Check your Jupyter server logs**: If you are still having problems, you can check the Jupyter server logs for any error messages. You can do this by running `jupyter notebook --debug` in the terminal.

If none of these steps solve your problem, please provide more information about your setup and the exact error message you are getting.
