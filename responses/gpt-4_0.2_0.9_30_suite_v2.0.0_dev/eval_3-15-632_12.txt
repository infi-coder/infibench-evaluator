If the line of data you're trying to split into 5 columns is comma-separated, you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the string into an array, and then assign each array element to a cell in the row. Here's how you can do it:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, ",") ' assuming the data is comma-separated
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

Please replace the comma in the `Split` function with whatever character is used to separate the data in your text file. If the number of columns can vary, you might need to add some error checking to prevent out-of-bounds errors.
