The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling ZIP archives. This extension is not a package that can be installed via composer. It needs to be installed on your PHP environment.

If you are using a Unix-like OS, you can install it via the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you are using Windows, you need to enable it in your `php.ini` file by uncommenting or adding the line:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing or enabling the extension, you can check if it's enabled by running:

```bash
php -m | grep zip
```

If it's enabled, you should see `zip` in the output.

In your `composer.json` file, you can specify that your project requires this extension by adding it to the `require` section:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1.3",
    "ext-zip": "*",
    // other dependencies...
},
```

This won't install the extension, but when someone tries to install your project via composer, they will get a message that they need to have the `zip` extension installed.
