In Rust, the `Box<T>` type is a smart pointer that points to data on the heap. It cannot be null, because it is always initialized with some value. If you want to have an optional `Box<T>`, you should use `Option<Box<T>>` instead. This way, you can use `None` to represent a null pointer.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

You can check if a `Box<T>` is null by checking if the `Option<Box<T>>` is `None`:

```rust
if let Some(node) = &stack.top {
    // The stack is not empty, do something with node
} else {
    // The stack is empty
}
```

Or using `is_none()`:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    // The stack is empty
}
```

Remember that in Rust, you don't need to manually deallocate the memory of a `Box<T>`. When a `Box<T>` goes out of scope, its destructor is called and the memory is deallocated. This is one of the ways Rust ensures memory safety.
