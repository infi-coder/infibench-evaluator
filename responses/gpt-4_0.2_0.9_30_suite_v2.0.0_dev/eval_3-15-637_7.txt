The error you're encountering could be due to several reasons. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Check SeleniumBasic and Browser Driver Version:** Ensure that you have the latest version of SeleniumBasic installed. Also, check if the browser driver (like chromedriver for Chrome) is compatible with the version of the browser installed on your machine.

2. **Re-register the Selenium Type Library:** Sometimes, the type library might not be registered correctly. You can manually register it using the following steps:

    - Open the VBA editor by pressing `Alt + F11`.
    - Go to `Tools > References`.
    - Uncheck the box next to `Selenium Type Library`, click `OK`.
    - Go back to `Tools > References`, check the box next to `Selenium Type Library`, click `OK`.

3. **Check Internet Explorer Version:** If you're using Internet Explorer as the browser, ensure that it's version 11 or above. Selenium WebDriver does not support versions below IE 11.

4. **Check Excel Trust Center Settings:** In Excel, go to `File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Macro Settings`. Ensure that `Trust access to the VBA project object model` is checked.

5. **Run Excel as Administrator:** Sometimes, running Excel with administrator privileges can resolve the issue.

6. **Check for Missing References:** In the VBA editor, go to `Tools > References` and check if there are any references marked as `MISSING`. If there are, uncheck them and try running your code again.
