Sure, you can use the `numpy.amax()` function to find the maximum value along an axis. Here is the function you need:

```python
import numpy as np

def getMax(matrix):
    # Select the third column from each 2D array in the 3D array
    third_column = matrix[:,:,2]
    # Find the max value in each 2D array
    max_values = np.amax(third_column, axis=1)
    # Reshape the array to 2D
    max_values = max_values.reshape(-1, 1)
    return max_values
```

This function works by first selecting the third column from each 2D array in the 3D array. Then it finds the maximum value in each of these 2D arrays. Finally, it reshapes the resulting 1D array to a 2D array.
