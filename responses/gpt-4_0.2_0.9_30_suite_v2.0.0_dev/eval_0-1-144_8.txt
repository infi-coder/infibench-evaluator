You can change the accordion arrow color by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This pseudo-element is responsible for the arrow. Here's how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* Auto width (default is 2em) */
    width: auto;
    /* Change the color here */
    color: green;
    /* Unicode character for "down arrow" (25B2) */
    content: "\25B2";
}
.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    /* Unicode character for "right arrow" (25B6) */
    content: "\25B6";
}
```

This CSS code will change the color of the arrow to green. The `::after` pseudo-element is used to insert something after the content of each selected element(s). In this case, it's used to insert the arrow. The `content` property is used in conjunction with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements, to insert generated content. The `"\25B2"` and `"\25B6"` are Unicode characters for "down arrow" and "right arrow" respectively.
