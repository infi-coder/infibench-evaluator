This issue might be related to the target membership of your SwiftUI file. Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot:

1. Open your SwiftUI file in Xcode.
2. Select the file in the Project Navigator.
3. In the File Inspector, under "Target Membership", make sure your app's target is checked.

If your file is already part of the target, you can try the following:

1. Clean your project (Product -> Clean Build Folder).
2. Restart Xcode.
3. Try running the preview again.

If none of these steps work, you might want to consider creating a new SwiftUI file and copying your code into it. Sometimes Xcode can get confused with file states, and creating a new file can help reset this.
