The error you're encountering is due to changes in Android 12 (API level 31) regarding `PendingIntent`. From this version onwards, you must specify whether the `PendingIntent` is mutable or immutable by using `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` or `FLAG_MUTABLE`.

The error is thrown by the `MediaSessionCompat` class, which is part of the AndroidX Media library. The current version of the library (1.4.0) doesn't handle this change correctly.

The Android team is aware of this issue and it's expected to be fixed in the next version of the AndroidX Media library. You can track the issue on the [Android Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/192358058).

In the meantime, you can use a workaround to avoid the crash. The idea is to create a `PendingIntent` manually and pass it to the `MediaSessionCompat` constructor. Here's how you can do it:

```kotlin
override fun onCreate() {
  super.onCreate()

  val mediaButtonReceiver = ComponentName(this, MediaButtonReceiver::class.java)
  val mediaButtonIntent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_BUTTON)
  mediaButtonIntent.component = mediaButtonReceiver
  val pendingIntentFlags = if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 31) {
    PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE or PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT
  } else {
    PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT
  }
  val mbrIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, mediaButtonIntent, pendingIntentFlags)

  mediaSession = MediaSessionCompat(this, TAG, mediaButtonReceiver, mbrIntent).apply {
    setCallback(mediaSessionCallback)
    isActive = true
  }
  ...
}
```

This code creates a `PendingIntent` with the `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` flag if the Android version is 31 or above. It then passes this `PendingIntent` to the `MediaSessionCompat` constructor.

Please note that you need to replace `MediaButtonReceiver::class.java` with your own `BroadcastReceiver` that handles media button events. If you don't have one, you can just pass `null` instead of `mediaButtonReceiver` and `mbrIntent`.
