You should use `@Configuration` when you want to define beans explicitly in your application. It is typically used in situations where you need to create Spring beans conditionally or with specific initialization parameters, which cannot be done with `@Service`, `@Controller`, or `@Component`.

These other annotations (`@Service`, `@Controller`, `@Component`) are typically used to auto-detect and auto-configure beans using classpath scanning. They are used to annotate classes at the stereotype level, allowing for automatic detection of classes.

In summary, use `@Configuration` for explicit, programmatic bean definitions and use `@Service`, `@Controller`, `@Component` for autodetection of beans.
