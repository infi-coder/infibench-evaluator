AWS CLI version 2 introduced automatic paging for commands that return multiple pages of output. To disable this feature, you can set the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string.

You can do this in your bash script like so:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  AWS_PAGER="" aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

Alternatively, you can set this environment variable in your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc.) to disable the pager for all AWS CLI commands:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

After adding this line to your shell profile, you will need to source the profile or restart your terminal session for the changes to take effect.

If you want to pipe the return values into a separate file, you can do so by appending `> filename.txt` to the end of your command:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  AWS_PAGER="" aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > output.txt; 
done
```

This will redirect all output from the command to `output.txt`. If you want to append to the file instead of overwriting it each time, you can use `>>` instead of `>`.
