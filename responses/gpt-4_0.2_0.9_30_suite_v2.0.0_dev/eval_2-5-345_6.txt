This error is caused by an incompatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and Maven 3.8.5. The issue is that IntelliJ IDEA is trying to use a method from the `DefaultModelValidator` class that doesn't exist in Maven 3.8.5.

To resolve this issue, you can downgrade your Maven version to 3.8.4 or earlier. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Download Maven 3.8.4 from the [Apache Maven Project Archives](https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/).

2. Extract the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.

3. Configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the Maven 3.8.4 installation:

   - Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `Preferences` on macOS).
   
   - In the Settings/Preferences dialog, go to `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `Build Tools` > `Maven`.
   
   - In the `Maven home directory` field, enter the path to your Maven 3.8.4 installation.

4. Click `OK` to save the changes.

5. Restart IntelliJ IDEA.

After these steps, your projects should import without any issues. If you still encounter problems, you might need to reimport your project:

1. Right-click on the project in the Project tool window.

2. Select `Maven` > `Reimport`.
