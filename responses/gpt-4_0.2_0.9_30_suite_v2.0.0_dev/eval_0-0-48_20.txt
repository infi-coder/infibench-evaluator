The issue with your code is that TypeScript doesn't allow you to use multiple index signatures in a single type. However, you can create two separate types and then merge them using intersection (`&`).

Here's how you can define `FruitsAndColors`:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type that has a numeric property for each fruit and a boolean property for each color.
