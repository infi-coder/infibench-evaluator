The reason why you are seeing the log "2" before log "1" is because the `onItemSelected` method is called asynchronously when an item is selected in the spinner. This means that the function `setupListWithAdapter` will continue to execute and return `itemSelected` (which is empty at this point) before an item is selected in the spinner.

To fix this, you need to use a callback function to get the selected item. Here is an example:

```kotlin
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>, callback: (String) -> Unit) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            Log.e("categoryLog","1 : " + itemSelected)
            callback(itemSelected)
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
}
```

Then you can use this function like this:

```kotlin
mySpinner.setupListWithAdapter(myList) { selectedItem ->
    // Do something with selectedItem
    Log.e("categoryLog","2 : " + selectedItem)
}
```

In this example, the `callback` function will be called with the selected item as soon as an item is selected in the spinner.
