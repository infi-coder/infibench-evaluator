This problem is related to the way Java handles quotes in the command line arguments. The error message indicates that there is a malformed argument with an embedded quote. 

The issue is that the command line arguments are being passed as a single string, and Java is having trouble parsing it. 

One way to solve this problem is to split the command into a string array, with each argument as a separate element in the array. This way, Java can correctly parse the arguments, even if they contain spaces.

Here is how you can do it:

```java
String[] cmd = {
    "cmd", 
    "/c", 
    "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5", 
    "C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd", 
    "-DskipTests=true", 
    "-Dmaven.ext.class.path=C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar", 
    "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8", 
    "clean", 
    "install"
};

ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(cmd);
pb.directory(new File("C:\\projects\\open"));
Process p = pb.start();
```

This way, each argument is passed as a separate string, and Java can correctly parse the command line arguments. 

If you are not running this from Java and it's a command you are trying to run directly in the command line, you might need to escape the quotes with a backslash (`\"`) or use single quotes (`'`) instead. 

If none of these solutions work, it might be a bug in NetBeans 11.1. In this case, you might want to consider updating to a newer version of NetBeans or reporting the bug to the NetBeans team.
