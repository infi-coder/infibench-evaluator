The error you're encountering is due to a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version (3.8.5) that comes with Spring Boot 2.7.0.

The issue is that IntelliJ IDEA is trying to use a method in the `DefaultModelValidator` class that no longer exists in Maven 3.8.5.

Here are a few solutions to this problem:

1. **Downgrade Maven version**: You can downgrade the Maven version in your project to a version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by modifying the `pom.xml` file in your project and specifying the Maven version in the `maven-wrapper.properties` file.

2. **Upgrade IntelliJ IDEA**: JetBrains, the company behind IntelliJ IDEA, usually releases updates to their IDE to fix such compatibility issues. You can check if there's an update available for IntelliJ IDEA and install it.

3. **Use an External Maven**: You can configure IntelliJ IDEA to use an external Maven that is compatible. Go to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven`. Under `Maven home directory`, select the directory of the Maven version you want to use.

Remember to re-import the project after making these changes.
