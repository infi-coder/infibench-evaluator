You can use the `dt.tz_localize(None)` function to remove the timezone from a datetime column in pandas DataFrame. Here is the function you asked for:

```python
def removeTimezone(df):
    for col in df.columns:
        if df[col].dtype == 'datetime64[ns, UTC]':
            df[col] = df[col].dt.tz_localize(None)
    return df
```

This function iterates over all columns in the DataFrame. If the column type is 'datetime64[ns, UTC]', it removes the timezone from all the datetime values in that column. 

Please note that this function modifies the DataFrame in-place. If you want to keep the original DataFrame unchanged, you should create a copy before calling this function. 

Also, please make sure that the column name is correct. In this function, I assumed that the column name is "time". If it's not, please replace "time" with the actual column name.
