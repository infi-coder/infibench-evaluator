The error message suggests that the response you're getting from your server is not a valid JSON string. This could be due to a number of reasons:

1. The server might not be returning a JSON response at all. It could be returning HTML or plain text, for example. You can check this by printing out the response body before trying to decode it:

    ```dart
    print('Response body: ${response.body}');
    ```

2. There might be some invisible characters at the start of the response that are causing the JSON decoding to fail. This could be due to a BOM (Byte Order Mark) or some other invisible character. You can try removing these before decoding the JSON:

    ```dart
    String responseBody = response.body;
    if (responseBody.codeUnitAt(0) == 65279) {
      responseBody = responseBody.substring(1);
    }
    List data = json.decode(responseBody);
    ```

3. The server might be returning a JSON error message, which is not the same as a successful JSON response. You should check the status code of the response to make sure it's 200 (OK):

    ```dart
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      List data = json.decode(response.body);
    } else {
      print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}.');
    }
    ```

4. If none of the above solutions work, there might be an issue with the server-side PHP code. You should check the PHP code to make sure it's correctly generating a JSON response.
