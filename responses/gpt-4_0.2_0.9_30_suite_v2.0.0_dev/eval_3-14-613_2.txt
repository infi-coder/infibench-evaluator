This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being part of the current build scheme. Here are some steps to try and resolve the issue:

1. Ensure that the SwiftUI Preview is part of the current build scheme. You can do this by going to `Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme`. Under `Build`, make sure your target is added and checked.

2. Clean your project by going to `Product > Clean Build Folder`.

3. Close Xcode and delete derived data. You can do this by going to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData` and deleting the folder related to your project.

4. Restart Xcode and try to build your project again.

If the problem persists, you might want to consider creating a new project and migrating your code. This can sometimes resolve issues that are related to project configuration.
