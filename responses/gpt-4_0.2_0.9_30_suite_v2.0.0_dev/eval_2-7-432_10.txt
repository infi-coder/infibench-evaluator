The "419 Page Expired" error is a CSRF token mismatch error. When you log out from one tab, Laravel invalidates the session including the CSRF token. So, when you try to log out from the other tab, the CSRF token from the session doesn't match the CSRF token sent with the request, hence the error.

To handle this, you can catch the `TokenMismatchException` in your `Handler.php` file and redirect the user to the login page or wherever you want. Here's how you can do it:

```php
// app/Exceptions/Handler.php

use Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException;

public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof TokenMismatchException) {
        // Redirect to a form. Here is an example of how we can
        // return a view or just redirect to the login form
        return redirect('login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

This way, if a `TokenMismatchException` is thrown (which is what happens when a CSRF token mismatch occurs), the user will be redirected to the login page instead of seeing the "419 Page Expired" error.
