You can use the `pkg_resources` module to get the installed version of a package, and the `requests` module to get the latest version of a package from PyPI. Here is a function that does this:

```python
import requests
import pkg_resources

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    try:
        # Get installed version
        installed_version = pkg_resources.get_distribution(pkgName).version
    except pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:
        print(f"{pkgName} is not installed.")
        return False

    # Get latest version
    response = requests.get(f"https://pypi.org/pypi/{pkgName}/json")
    releases = response.json()['releases']
    latest_version = max(releases)

    # Compare versions
    if pkg_resources.parse_version(installed_version) < pkg_resources.parse_version(latest_version):
        print(f"A newer version of {pkgName} is available.")
        return False
    else:
        print(f"{pkgName} is up to date.")
        return True
```

This function will return `True` if the installed version of the package is the latest, and `False` otherwise. It will also print a message indicating whether the package is up to date or not. If the package is not installed, it will print a message and return `False`.

Please note that this function requires the `requests` package. If it's not installed, you can install it with `pip install requests`.
