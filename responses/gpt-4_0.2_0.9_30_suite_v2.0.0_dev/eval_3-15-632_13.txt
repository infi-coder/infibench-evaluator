Assuming that the line you are trying to split is a string with values separated by a delimiter (like a comma or a space), you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the string into an array, and then assign each array element to a cell in the row. Here's an example:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitText As Variant
    splitText = Split(textline, " ") ' replace " " with your delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitText(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitText(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitText(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitText(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitText(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

In this example, I assumed that the delimiter is a space (" "). You should replace it with the actual delimiter in your text file. Also, adjust the indices of `splitText` and the column letters as per your requirement.
