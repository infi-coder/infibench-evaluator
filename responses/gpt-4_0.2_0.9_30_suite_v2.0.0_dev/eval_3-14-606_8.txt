The alert you're seeing is likely related to the app being a developer or test build. iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" like Android. However, you can enable developer options by connecting your device to a Mac and using Xcode.

Here are the steps to enable developer options:

1. Install the latest version of Xcode on your Mac. You can download it from the Mac App Store.

2. Connect your iOS device to your Mac using a USB cable.

3. Open Xcode and go to `Window -> Devices and Simulators`.

4. Select your device from the list in the left sidebar.

5. If necessary, click on `Use for Development`. You may need to enter your Apple ID and password.

6. Once your device is set up for development, you should be able to run the provisioned testing build.

If you're still having trouble, the issue might be with the provisioning profile used to build the app. You might need to rebuild the app with a correct provisioning profile, or you might need to add your device's UDID to the list of devices in the provisioning profile. 

Remember, you should only install apps from trusted sources, even when using developer or test builds.
