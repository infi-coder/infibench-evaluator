The error message `Parsing error: Cannot read file '.../tsconfig.json'.eslint` indicates that ESLint is unable to find or read your `tsconfig.json` file. 

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the `project` option in `parserOptions` as `tsconfig.json`. This tells ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file. 

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, you will need to provide the correct relative path to the `tsconfig.json` file. 

For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would need to change the `project` option to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "../tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

If your `tsconfig.json` and `.eslintrc.js` files are in the same directory and you are still getting the error, there may be a problem with the contents of your `tsconfig.json` file. Make sure that it is valid JSON and that it does not contain any syntax errors. 

If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider creating a new `tsconfig.json` file using the `tsc --init` command and then copying over your existing configuration options. This will ensure that you have a valid `tsconfig.json` file. 

If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about your project structure and the exact error message you are seeing.
