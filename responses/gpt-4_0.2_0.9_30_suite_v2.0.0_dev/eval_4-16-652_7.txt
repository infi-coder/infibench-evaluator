AWS CLI version 2 introduced automatic paging for commands that return multiple pages of output. However, this can be inconvenient in some cases, such as when you're running scripts.

To disable the pager, you can set the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. You can do this in your script before running the AWS CLI commands:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will disable the pager for the duration of the script.

If you want to disable the pager permanently, you can add the `export AWS_PAGER=""` line to your shell profile file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash, `~/.zshrc` for zsh, etc.), and it will be set every time you open a new terminal session.

If you want to redirect the output to a file, you can use the `>` operator:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > output.txt; 
done
```

This will write the output of each command to `output.txt`. If you want to append the output of each command to the file instead of overwriting it, you can use the `>>` operator:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo >> output.txt; 
done
```
