Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. You are trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you haven't declared them. In VBA, you need to declare variables using the `Dim` keyword.

2. You are trying to assign a worksheet name to `currentSheet` variable, but then you don't use it anywhere in your code.

3. You are trying to use `query` as both a string (when you assign it a value from a cell) and a `WorkbookQuery` object (when you use `query.Name`).

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Assign the query string from a cell
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Assign the active sheet to currentSheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Create a ListObject with a Query Table
    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code assumes that the string in `Sheet6` cell `A1` is the name of a Power Query query in your workbook. If it's not, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.
