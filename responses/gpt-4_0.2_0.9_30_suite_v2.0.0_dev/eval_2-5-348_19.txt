The error message you're seeing is related to the way the command is being interpreted by the command line. The issue is with the embedded quotes in the command.

Here's a possible solution:

1. Open the `mvn.cmd` file located at `C:\Program Files\NetBeans-11.1\netbeans\java\maven\bin\`.

2. Find the line that starts with `set MAVEN_CMD_LINE_ARGS=`.

3. Replace that line with the following line:

    ```cmd
    set MAVEN_CMD_LINE_ARGS=%*
    ```

4. Save the file and try to build your project again.

This change will make the `mvn.cmd` script interpret the command line arguments as they are, without any additional processing that might cause issues with quotes.
