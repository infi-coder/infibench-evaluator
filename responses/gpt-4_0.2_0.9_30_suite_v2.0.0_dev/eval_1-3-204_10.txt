The `rename` function is used to rename the DataFrame's index or columns directly, not the result of a groupby operation. In your case, you are trying to rename the column of a Series, not a DataFrame. The result of the `groupby` operation is a Series, not a DataFrame. 

Here is the correct way to do it:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg.columns = ['t', 'mean']
    return avg
```

In this function, `groupby` is used to group the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column. The `reset_index` function is used to convert the Series to a DataFrame. Then, the columns of the DataFrame are renamed to 't' and 'mean'. 

This function will return a DataFrame with the "t" column and the mean of the "p" column, which is renamed as "mean".
