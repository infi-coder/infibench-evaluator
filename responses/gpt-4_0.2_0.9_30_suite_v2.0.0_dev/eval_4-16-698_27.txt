You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how you do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command reads and executes the `.bash_profile` file in the current shell. The `~` symbol is a shortcut for your home directory.

If you made changes to other configuration files, you can use the `source` command in the same way. Just replace `~/.bash_profile` with the path to the file you want to reload.

The `source` command is a shell built-in command that reads and executes commands from the file specified as its argument in the current shell environment.
