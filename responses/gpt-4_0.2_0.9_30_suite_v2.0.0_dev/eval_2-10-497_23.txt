In Rust, `Box<T>` is a smart pointer that points to data on the heap. Unlike in C++ or other languages, Rust doesn't have the concept of null for its Box type. Instead, Rust encourages the use of the `Option<T>` type for optional values, which can be `Some(T)` or `None`.

You can use `Option<Box<Node>>` in your `Stack` struct to represent a possibly-empty stack. Here's how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

In this code, `None` represents an empty stack or the end of the stack. You can check if the stack is empty or if you've reached the end of the stack by checking if `top` or `next` is `None`.

Here's an example of how you can check if `top` is `None`:

```rust
if let Some(top_node) = &stack.top {
    // top is not None, do something with top_node
} else {
    // top is None, the stack is empty
}
```

Or using `match`:

```rust
match &stack.top {
    Some(top_node) => {
        // top is not None, do something with top_node
    },
    None => {
        // top is None, the stack is empty
    }
}
```

In both of these examples, `top_node` is a reference to the `Box<Node>` in `top`.
