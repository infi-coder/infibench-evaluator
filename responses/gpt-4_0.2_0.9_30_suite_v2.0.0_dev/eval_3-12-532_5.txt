The error message indicates that the JSON decoding failed due to an unexpected character at the beginning of the response body. This usually happens when the server response is not a valid JSON string.

Here are a few things you can do to solve this issue:

1. **Check the server response**: Print the server response before decoding it. This will help you identify if the response is a valid JSON string.

```dart
print('Response body: ${response.body}');
```

2. **Check the server-side script**: Ensure that your PHP script is correctly outputting a JSON response. Make sure you are using `json_encode()` for the response and that no characters (like whitespaces or BOM) are being output before the JSON response.

3. **Handle the error**: You can catch the `FormatException` and handle it appropriately. This will prevent your app from crashing when the server response is not a valid JSON string.

```dart
try {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} catch (e) {
  print('Error: $e');
}
```

4. **Check the content type**: Ensure that the server is sending the response with the correct content type (`application/json`). You can check this in the response headers.

```dart
print('Content type: ${response.headers['content-type']}');
```

Remember that debugging is a process of elimination. By checking each of these points, you should be able to identify and fix the issue.
