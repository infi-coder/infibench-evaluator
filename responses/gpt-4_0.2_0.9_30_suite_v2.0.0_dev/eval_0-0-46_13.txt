The error message you're seeing is because ESLint is trying to find your `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, but it's not there.

To fix this, you need to provide the correct path to your `tsconfig.json` file in your `.eslintrc.js` file. 

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project, and your `.eslintrc.js` file is also in the root directory, then you can leave it as `"project": "tsconfig.json"`.

However, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in a different directory, you need to provide the relative path from your `.eslintrc.js` file to your `tsconfig.json` file. For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in a `config` directory, you would change it to `"project": "./config/tsconfig.json"`.

Here is the updated `.eslintrc.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  env: {
    browser: true,
    es6: true,
    node: true,
  },
  extends: [
    "plugin:import/errors",
    "plugin:import/warnings",
    "plugin:import/typescript",
  ],
  parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  parserOptions: {
    project: "./path/to/your/tsconfig.json", // update this path
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  plugins: [
    "@typescript-eslint",
    "import",
  ],
  rules: {
    // ... your rules
  },
  settings: {
    jsdoc: {
      tagNamePreference: {
        returns: "return",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Replace `"./path/to/your/tsconfig.json"` with the actual relative path to your `tsconfig.json` file. 

After updating the path, restart your IDE or the ESLint server for the changes to take effect.
