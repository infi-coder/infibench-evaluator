AWS CLI version 2 introduced automatic pagination by using a pager. This is the reason why you are seeing this behavior. You can disable this by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. 

You can do this in your current shell session by running:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

Or you can add the above line to your shell's profile file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash) to make it permanent.

Then, your script would look like this:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""

for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will disable the pager and the output will be directly printed to the console. If you want to redirect the output to a file, you can use the redirection operator `>`:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""

for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > output.txt; 
done
```

This will write the output of the `aws` command to the file `output.txt`. If you want to append the output to the file instead of overwriting it each time, you can use `>>` instead of `>`.
