The `@Autowired` annotation is not necessary if the target bean only defines one constructor. As of Spring 4.3, if a class only declares one constructor, it is automatically used for dependency injection by Spring.

However, if there are multiple constructors, Spring doesn't know which one to choose, so you need to add `@Autowired` to the constructor you want to use for dependency injection.

Also, using `@Autowired` can make it explicit that Spring is managing the object and injecting dependencies, which can be helpful for readability and understanding the code.
