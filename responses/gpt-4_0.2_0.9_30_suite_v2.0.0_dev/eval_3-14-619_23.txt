Your code seems fine, but the issue might be that you're trying to test the `@Binding` in the `PreviewProvider`. The `PreviewProvider` doesn't support interactivity, so changes to `@Binding` or `@State` variables won't be reflected there.

To test your `ContentView`, you should embed it in another `View` that owns the `@State` variable. Here's an example:

```swift
struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var isSelected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $isSelected)
    }
}
```

Now, run your app and use `ParentView` instead of `ContentView`. You should see the button text toggle between "Selected" and "Not Selected" when you click it.
