The error message suggests that the Python interpreter inside the Docker container cannot find the `app` module. This is likely because the `app` directory is not correctly copied into the Docker image.

Here's how you can revise your Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8

# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Add the current directory contents into the container at /app
ADD . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
COPY requirements.txt /app
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /app/requirements.txt

# Make port 8000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the command to start uvicorn
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]
```

This Dockerfile will copy the entire current directory (which should include your `app` directory) into the Docker image. It will also correctly place the `requirements.txt` file in the `/app` directory before running `pip install`.

Also, make sure your `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly set up. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

This will build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory and map port 8000 in the container to port 8000 on the host machine.
