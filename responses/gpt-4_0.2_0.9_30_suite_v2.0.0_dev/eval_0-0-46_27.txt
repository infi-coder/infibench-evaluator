The error message you're seeing is from ESLint, which is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. It's saying that it can't read your `tsconfig.json` file.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the `project` property in `parserOptions` as `tsconfig.json`. This means ESLint is looking for `tsconfig.json` in the same directory as `.eslintrc.js`.

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, you'll need to provide the correct relative path. For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would need to change the `project` property to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "../tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file and you're still seeing the error, there may be a problem with the contents of your `tsconfig.json` file. The contents you've posted look fine, but you might want to double-check that there are no syntax errors or misplaced commas.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to try deleting your `node_modules` directory and running `npm install` again to ensure all your dependencies are correctly installed.
