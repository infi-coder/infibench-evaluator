Sure, you can use the `last:` variant provided by Tailwind CSS to target the last element in a list. Here's how you can modify your code:

```html
  <ul>
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      :class="{ 'border-b border-black': index !== items.length - 1 }"
      class="border-solid"
    >
      Item
    </li>
  </ul>
```

In this code, we're using Vue's class binding syntax to conditionally apply the `border-b border-black` classes only when the current item is not the last one in the list. This is determined by checking if `index` is not equal to `items.length - 1`.

Please note that you need to enable the `last` variant in your Tailwind CSS configuration for some utilities. If you haven't done this, you can add it to your `tailwind.config.js` file like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  variants: {
    extend: {
      borderColor: ['last'],
      borderWidth: ['last'],
    }
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

This will enable the `last:` variant for border color and border width utilities.
