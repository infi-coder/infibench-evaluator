You can use `awk` to extract the language code. Here's how you can modify your command:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | cut -d '"' -f 2
```

Here's what the command does:

- `curl -Ls stick-it.app` fetches the HTML of the page.
- `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'` extracts the `lang` attribute and its value. The `-o` option tells `grep` to only output the part of the line that matches the pattern. The pattern `'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'` matches `lang="`, followed by any number of letters or hyphens, followed by `"`.
- `cut -d '"' -f 2` splits the output on `"`, and selects the second field, which is the language code.

This command should work regardless of how the `lang` attribute is formatted in the HTML. It will match any language code that consists of letters and hyphens.
