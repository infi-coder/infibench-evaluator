The `rename` function is used to rename the DataFrame's index or columns. However, when you use `groupby` and `mean` functions, it returns a Series, not a DataFrame. That's why you are getting a `TypeError`.

Here is the correct way to rename the column in your case:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg.columns = ['t', 'mean']
    return avg
```

In this function, `groupby` and `mean` functions are used to calculate the mean of column "p" grouped by column "t". The `reset_index` function is used to convert the Series to a DataFrame. Then, you can rename the columns by assigning a new list of column names to `df.columns`.

Here is how you can use this function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

datain = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 3, 4, 5, 6], [2, 4, 5, 6, 7]])
df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])

df = renameDataFrame(df)
print(df)
```

This will print:

```
   t  mean
0  1   2.5
1  2   4.0
```

This shows that the function works as expected.
