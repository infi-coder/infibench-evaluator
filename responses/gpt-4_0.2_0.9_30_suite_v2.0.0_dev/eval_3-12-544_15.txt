The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to access platform-specific functionality before `runApp()` is called, and before the Flutter engine is fully initialized. 

To fix this, you should move your platform-specific code inside the `main()` function into the `initState()` method of your widget. 

Here's how you can do it:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initHive();
  }

  Future<void> initHive() async {
    final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
    // other Hive initialization code
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // your build method code
  }
}
```

In this code, the `initHive()` function is called in the `initState()` method of the `MyApp` widget. This ensures that the Flutter engine is fully initialized before you try to access platform-specific functionality.
