The `ext-zip` is a reference to the ZIP PHP extension. This extension is not a package that can be installed via Composer. It's a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server or local development environment.

The error message you're seeing is because Composer is trying to find a package named `ext-zip`, but it doesn't exist.

If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can install the ZIP extension with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

Or if you're using PHP 7.0, use:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php7.0-zip
```

If you're using a Windows operating system, you will need to enable the extension in your `php.ini` file. Find and uncomment the line:

```ini
;extension=php_zip.dll
```

to

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing or enabling the ZIP extension, you may need to restart your web server for the changes to take effect.

Once the ZIP extension is installed, you don't need to require it in your `composer.json` file. Composer checks the platform requirements against your current server PHP environment. So, if the ZIP extension is installed, Composer will know it and the warning will disappear.
