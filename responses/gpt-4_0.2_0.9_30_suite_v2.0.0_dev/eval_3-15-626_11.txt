Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. You are trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you didn't declare them. In VBA, you need to declare variables with `Dim` keyword.

2. You are trying to use `query` as a `WorkbookQuery` object, but you are assigning a string value to it. You need to create a `WorkbookQuery` object and assign it to `query`.

3. You are trying to use `currentSheet` as a `Worksheet` object, but you are assigning a string value to it. You need to get a `Worksheet` object and assign it to `currentSheet`.

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Get the query from the cell A1 in Sheet6
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Get the current active sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Create a ListObject with a Query Table
    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

Please note that this code assumes that you have a valid Power Query in the cell A1 of Sheet6, and that you want to load the result of the query to the cell A1 of the sheet named "target".
