Sure, here is a bash script to install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current version of python
brew unlink python

# Install the required version
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed version
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script assumes that you have Homebrew installed and that it's updated to the latest version. Also, the script doesn't handle any errors that might occur during the execution.
