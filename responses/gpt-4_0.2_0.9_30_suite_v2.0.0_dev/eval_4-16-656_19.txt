The `Get-Service` cmdlet in PowerShell does not provide a detailed description of the service. However, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to get the description of the service. Here is an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * from Win32_Service" | Select-Object Name, Description | Out-GridView
```

This command will get all services and their descriptions and output them in a grid view.

If you want to get the description of a specific service, you can use the following command:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * from Win32_Service where Name='serviceName'" | Select-Object Name, Description
```

Replace `'serviceName'` with the name of the service you want to get the description for.
