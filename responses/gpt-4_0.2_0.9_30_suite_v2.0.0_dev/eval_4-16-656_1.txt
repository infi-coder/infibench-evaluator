The `Get-Service` cmdlet in PowerShell doesn't provide the description of a service. However, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to get the description of a service. Here's how you can do it:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service" | Select-Object Name, Description | Out-GridView
```

This command will get all the services and their descriptions and display them in a grid view.

If you want to get the description of a specific service, you can filter the results by the service name. For example, to get the description of the `wuauserv` service, you can use the following command:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service Where Name = 'wuauserv'" | Select-Object Name, Description
```

This command will display the name and description of the `wuauserv` service.
