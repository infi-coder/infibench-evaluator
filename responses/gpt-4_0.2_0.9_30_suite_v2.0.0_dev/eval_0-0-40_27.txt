The problem you're experiencing is due to the fact that WSL2 is trying to use the Windows version of npm, which is not compatible with the Linux environment. 

To solve this issue, you need to remove the Windows PATH from WSL2. You can do this by editing the `.bashrc` file in your home directory. 

Open the `.bashrc` file with a text editor. You can use nano, which is a basic text editor available in Ubuntu:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

At the end of the file, add the following line:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"
```

This line will add the npm directory to your PATH, which will allow you to use the npm command.

After adding this line, save the file and exit the text editor. In nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y` to confirm that you want to save the changes, and then `Enter` to confirm the file name.

Then, you need to update your current shell session with the changes you made to the `.bashrc` file:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, you should be able to use the npm command without any issues. 

If you still face the same issue, try reinstalling npm in your WSL2 environment:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

Then check the npm version:

```bash
npm -v
```

This should display the version of npm that is installed in your WSL2 environment.
