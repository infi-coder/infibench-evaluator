You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, this will apply them to your current session.

If you're using zsh (which is the default in macOS Catalina and newer), the equivalent command would be:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

This command reads and executes commands from `.zshrc` in the current shell context.
