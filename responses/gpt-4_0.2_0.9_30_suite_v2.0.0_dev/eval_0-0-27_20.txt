The code you've provided seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you can check if you're having issues:

1. **Network Connection:** Make sure your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. Sometimes, network issues can cause the loading to hang indefinitely.

2. **Server Status:** Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can do this by visiting the URL in your web browser.

3. **Error Handling:** You might be having an error but not seeing it because of how you're handling errors. Try logging the error object to see if it contains any useful information:

    ```javascript
    if (error) {
        console.error(error);
        return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
    }
    ```

4. **Apollo Client Version:** There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (e.g., 3.3.21) and see if the problem persists.

5. **React Native Version:** There might be compatibility issues with the version of React Native you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (e.g., 0.63.4) and see if the problem persists.

6. **GraphQL Server Response:** The GraphQL server might not be returning the data in the format you're expecting. You can test the query using a GraphQL client like Apollo Studio or GraphQL Playground to see what the server response looks like.

7. **Apollo Client Setup:** Make sure that the Apollo Client is correctly set up. The `ApolloProvider` should be wrapping your app at the highest level, and the client should be passed to it as a prop.

If none of these suggestions work, you might want to consider creating a minimal reproducible example and asking for help on a platform like Stack Overflow or the Apollo GraphQL community forums.
