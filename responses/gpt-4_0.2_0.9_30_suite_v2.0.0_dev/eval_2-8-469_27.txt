The error message is indicating that the `go_package` option is missing in your proto file. This option is used to specify the package name for the generated Go code.

You can fix the error by adding a `go_package` option to your proto file. Here's how you can do it:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "main";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

In this example, the `go_package` option is set to "main", which means the generated Go code will be in the "main" package. You can replace "main" with the name of your desired package.

After making this change, you should be able to generate the Go code without any errors.
