The error `bad CPU type in executable` typically means that the binary you are trying to execute was compiled for a different architecture than what you are currently running. 

In the case of MacOS Catalina, Apple dropped support for 32-bit applications, so if you're trying to run a 32-bit binary, you'll get this error. 

Unfortunately, the official version of `pdftk` is not compatible with MacOS Catalina and later versions. However, there is a workaround for this issue. You can use a tool called `pdftk-java` which is a port of `pdftk` to Java.

Here are the steps to install `pdftk-java`:

1. First, you need to install Homebrew if you haven't already. Open Terminal and run the following command:

```markdown
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install `pdftk-java` by running:

```markdown
brew install pdftk-java
```

3. After the installation, you can use `pdftk-java` just like you would use `pdftk`. However, you need to replace `pdftk` in your commands with `pdftk-java`.

For example, if you previously ran a command like this:

```markdown
pdftk input.pdf output output.pdf
```

You would now run:

```markdown
pdftk-java input.pdf output output.pdf
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
