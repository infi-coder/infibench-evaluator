Source maps are files that associate the compiled JavaScript that runs in the browser with the original TypeScript source code. They are primarily used for debugging purposes.

When `"sourceMap": true` is set in your `tsconfig.json`, the TypeScript compiler generates corresponding `.map` files for each compiled `.js` file. These `.map` files are source map files. They are not needed for your application to run, but they are very useful when you need to debug your application.

When you debug your TypeScript code, the browser uses the source map files to display the original TypeScript code instead of the compiled JavaScript code. This makes debugging much easier because you can read and debug your code as you wrote it.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the TypeScript compiler will not generate these `.map` files. This means that if you try to debug your TypeScript code, the browser will display the compiled JavaScript code instead of the original TypeScript code. This can make debugging more difficult because the JavaScript code can look quite different from your TypeScript code, especially if you're using advanced TypeScript features.

In terms of your application's functionality, there will be no difference whether you set `"sourceMap"` to `true` or `false`. The setting only affects the debugging experience.
