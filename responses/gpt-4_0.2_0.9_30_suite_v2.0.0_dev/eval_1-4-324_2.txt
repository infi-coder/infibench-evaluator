Here is a function `mySplit` that uses the `strsplit` function to split the strings in the column `col1` of the dataframe `df`:

```r
mySplit <- function(df) {
  # Split the strings in col1 by comma
  split1 <- strsplit(df$col1, ",")
  
  # Split the resulting strings by colon
  split2 <- lapply(split1, function(x) strsplit(x, ":"))
  
  # Convert the split strings into a dataframe
  df2 <- do.call(rbind, lapply(split2, function(x) setNames(sapply(x, function(y) y[2]), sapply(x, function(y) y[1]))))
  
  # Convert the character columns to their appropriate types
  df2 <- type.convert(df2, as.is = TRUE)
  
  return(df2)
}
```

This function works by first splitting the strings in `col1` by comma, then splitting the resulting strings by colon. The resulting list of lists of strings is then converted into a dataframe, and the character columns are converted to their appropriate types.

You can use this function on your dataframe `df` like this:

```r
df <- data.frame(col1 = c("name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC", "name:Tom,Age:25,City:NA"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df2 <- mySplit(df)
print(df2)
```

This will print:

```r
      name Age City
1 Michael  31  NYC
2     Tom  25   NA
```
