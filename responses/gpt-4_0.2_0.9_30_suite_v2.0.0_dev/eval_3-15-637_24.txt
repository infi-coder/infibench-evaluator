The error you're experiencing might be due to a few reasons. Here are some possible solutions:

1. **Check the SeleniumBasic version**: Ensure that you're using the latest version of SeleniumBasic. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/florentbr/SeleniumBasic/releases). After installing, don't forget to add the reference in VBA (VBE > Tools > References > Selenium Type Library).

2. **Check the WebDriver**: Make sure you have the correct WebDriver for the browser you're using. For Internet Explorer, you can download the WebDriver from [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/). After downloading, you need to add its location to your system's PATH.

3. **Check the browser version**: The WebDriver version should be compatible with the browser version. If they are not compatible, you might face such issues.

4. **Check the code**: In your code, you're creating an instance of `WebDriver` and `Selenium.keys` but you're not using `keyObj`. If you're not using it, you can remove it. Also, you're declaring `IE` as an object but not using it. Here's how your code should look like:
    ```vba
    Dim driver As New WebDriver

    driver.Start "ie"
    driver.Window.Maximize
    driver.Get "https://www.google.com/"
    ```

5. **Check the Internet Explorer settings**: Since you're using Internet Explorer, make sure that the "Enable Protected Mode" setting is the same for all zones. To do this, go to Internet Options > Security.

6. **Try using a different browser**: If none of the above solutions work, try using a different browser like Chrome or Firefox. For this, you'll need to download the corresponding WebDriver and change the browser in your code:
    ```vba
    driver.Start "chrome"
    ```
