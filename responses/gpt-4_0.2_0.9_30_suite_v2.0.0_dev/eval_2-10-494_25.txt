The error message you're seeing is likely a false positive from rust-analyzer, which is a Language Server Protocol implementation for Rust. It's not perfect and sometimes it can show errors where there are none. 

The error message "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args`" is rust-analyzer's way of saying it's having trouble understanding a macro expansion, in this case, the `format_args!` macro which is used internally by the `assert_eq!` macro in your test.

If your code is compiling and running correctly with `cargo run`, `cargo test`, and `cargo check`, then it's likely that your code is fine and this is just an issue with rust-analyzer.

Here are a few things you could try to resolve this issue:

1. **Update rust-analyzer**: If you're using an older version of rust-analyzer, updating to the latest version might fix the issue.

2. **Restart your editor**: Sometimes, simply restarting your editor can help rust-analyzer to correctly analyze your code.

3. **Check your rust-analyzer settings**: Make sure that rust-analyzer is correctly configured in your editor. For example, if you're using VS Code, you can check your settings by going to `File > Preferences > Settings` and searching for `rust-analyzer`.

4. **Disable and re-enable rust-analyzer**: If all else fails, you could try disabling rust-analyzer, restarting your editor, and then re-enabling rust-analyzer.

If none of these solutions work, it's possible that this is a bug in rust-analyzer. In that case, you could consider reporting the issue on the rust-analyzer GitHub page.
