This issue can be caused by a variety of factors. Here are some steps you can try:

1. **Clean Build Folder**: Go to `Product -> Clean Build Folder` or use the shortcut `Shift + Command + K`.

2. **Delete Derived Data**: Go to `Xcode -> Preferences -> Locations -> Derived Data`, click on the arrow to open the folder in Finder, then delete the Derived Data folder.

3. **Check Target Membership**: Make sure your SwiftUI file is a member of the correct target. You can check this by selecting the file in the Project Navigator and checking the Target Membership in the File Inspector.

4. **Check Scheme**: Make sure the correct target is selected in your scheme. You can check this by going to `Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme`.

5. **Restart Xcode**: Sometimes, simply restarting Xcode can solve the issue.

6. **Update Xcode**: Make sure you are using the latest version of Xcode. You can check for updates in the App Store.

If none of these steps work, it might be a bug with Xcode. In this case, you can report the issue to Apple through their bug reporting system.
