The error you're encountering is due to changes in Android 12 (API level 31) regarding `PendingIntent` mutability. Starting from this version, you must explicitly specify whether a `PendingIntent` is mutable or immutable by using `FLAG_MUTABLE` or `FLAG_IMMUTABLE`.

The `MediaSessionCompat` class in the AndroidX Media library version 1.4.0 does not handle this requirement correctly, which is causing the crash.

To fix this issue, you should update the AndroidX Media library to version 1.4.3 or higher, where this issue has been addressed. 

You can do this by updating the dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
implementation 'androidx.media:media:1.4.3'
```

After updating the library, clean and rebuild your project. If you're still encountering the issue, please check other parts of your code where you might be creating `PendingIntent` instances without specifying the mutability flag.
