This issue might be due to several reasons, such as a problem with the Python extension, the Jupyter extension, or the IPython kernel itself. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. **Update your extensions and packages**: Make sure that your Python and Jupyter extensions in VS Code are up-to-date. Also, update the `ipykernel` package in your conda environment by running `conda update ipykernel`.

2. **Check your Python interpreter**: Ensure that the Python interpreter selected in VS Code is the one from your 'da38' environment. You can check this in the bottom-left corner of the VS Code status bar.

3. **Try to start Jupyter from the command line**: Try to start a Jupyter notebook from the command line in your 'da38' environment to see if the problem is specific to VS Code. You can do this by activating your environment with `conda activate da38` and then running `jupyter notebook`.

4. **Reinstall the Python extension**: If the above steps don't work, try reinstalling the Python extension in VS Code.

5. **Check the VS Code settings**: Check your settings.json file in VS Code for any settings related to Jupyter or Python that might be causing the issue.

6. **Check the Jupyter server logs**: If you're still having trouble, check the Jupyter server logs in the VS Code output panel for any error messages that might help diagnose the problem.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it might be helpful to provide more information about your setup, such as the versions of VS Code, the Python extension, and the Jupyter extension you're using, as well as any error messages you're seeing in the Jupyter server logs.
