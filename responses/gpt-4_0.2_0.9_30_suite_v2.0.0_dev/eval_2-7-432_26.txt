The error you're seeing is due to Laravel's built-in CSRF protection. When you log out from one tab, the session is invalidated, and the CSRF token associated with the session becomes invalid as well. So, when you try to log out from the other tab, Laravel throws a `419 Page Expired` error because the CSRF token is no longer valid.

To handle this, you can catch the `TokenMismatchException` in your `Handler.php` file and redirect the user to the login page. Here's how you can do it:

```php
// app/Exceptions/Handler.php

use Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException;

public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof TokenMismatchException) {
        // Redirect to a form. Here is an example of how we can
        // redirect to the login form:
        return redirect('/login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

This way, if a `TokenMismatchException` is thrown (which is what happens when a CSRF token is invalid), the user will be redirected to the login page instead of seeing the `419 Page Expired` error.

Remember to import the `TokenMismatchException` at the top of your `Handler.php` file:

```php
use Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException;
```

This solution should work for your scenario. However, it's important to note that this will apply to all forms in your application, not just the logout form. If you want to apply this only to the logout form, you might need to implement a custom solution.
