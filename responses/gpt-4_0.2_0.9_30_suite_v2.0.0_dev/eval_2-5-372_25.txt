It seems like you are facing a version conflict issue. Hibernate Validator 5.x does not support `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` for `String` type. These constraints are supported from Hibernate Validator 6.x onwards.

The error message you are seeing indicates that Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2 is being used, which does not support `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` for `String` type. This is why you are seeing the error.

The version of Hibernate Validator being used is likely being provided by JBoss, which is why it is different from the version resolved by Maven.

To resolve this issue, you can try one of the following:

1. Upgrade your JBoss version to one that includes Hibernate Validator 6.x.
2. Exclude the Hibernate Validator provided by JBoss and include the Hibernate Validator 6.x in your application. This can be done by adding the Hibernate Validator dependency to your `pom.xml` and setting the scope to `compile`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

And then excluding the Hibernate Validator module in your `jboss-deployment-structure.xml`:

```xml
<jboss-deployment-structure>
    <deployment>
        <exclusions>
            <module name="org.hibernate.validator" />
        </exclusions>
    </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
```

Please note that the above solutions may have other impacts on your application, so it is recommended to thoroughly test your application after making these changes.
