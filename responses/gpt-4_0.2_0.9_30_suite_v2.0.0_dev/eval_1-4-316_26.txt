The error you're getting is because the `sort` function in R doesn't work directly on lists. However, you can use the `unlist` function to convert the list to a vector, sort it, and then convert it back to a list if needed. Here's how you can define your `mySort` function:

```r
mySort <- function(l) {
  # Convert list to vector
  vec <- unlist(l)
  
  # Sort the vector
  sorted_vec <- sort(vec)
  
  # Convert back to list if needed
  sorted_list <- as.list(sorted_vec)
  
  return(sorted_list)
}
```

You can then call this function with your list:

```r
sorted_data = mySort(list_text_data)
```

This will return your list sorted alphabetically.
