The `rename` function is used to rename the DataFrame's index or columns. However, in your case, you are trying to rename the Series object's name after performing the `groupby` operation and calculating the mean. 

Here's how you can modify your function to achieve this:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean()
    avg.name = "mean"
    return avg
```

In this function, we first group the DataFrame `df` by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column. This results in a Series object, where the name of the Series is "p". We then rename the Series to "mean" by setting `avg.name = "mean"`.

Here's how you can use this function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assuming datafile is a valid file path
datafile = 'your_file_path_here'
datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])

avg = renameDataFrame(df)
```

Now, `avg` is a Series object with the name "mean", where the index is the unique values from the "t" column and the values are the mean of the "p" column for each "t".
