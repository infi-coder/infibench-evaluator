The error message is indicating that the `go_package` option is missing in your proto file. This option is used to specify the package name for the generated Go code. 

You can fix this by adding a `go_package` option to your proto file like so:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "main";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

In this case, the `go_package` option is set to "main", which means the generated Go code will be in package "main". You can replace "main" with whatever package name you want.

After making this change, you should be able to generate the Go code without any issues.
