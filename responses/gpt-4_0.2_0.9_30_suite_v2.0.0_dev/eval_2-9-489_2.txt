The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. Without these security features, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable the built-in security features of Elasticsearch. Here are the steps to do it:

1. Open your `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. This file is usually located in the `/etc/elasticsearch` or `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

    ```yaml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

If you're running Elasticsearch using Homebrew, you can restart it using the following command:

```bash
brew services restart elasticsearch
```

If you're running Elasticsearch as a standalone service, you can restart it using the following command:

```bash
sudo service elasticsearch restart
```

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning message should no longer appear.

Please note that enabling security will require you to set up user authentication for Elasticsearch. You can follow the instructions in the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html) to set up user authentication.

If you don't want to set up user authentication and you're okay with your Elasticsearch cluster being accessible to anyone (which is generally not recommended), you can ignore the warning message.
