Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. You're trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you haven't declared them. You should declare them at the beginning of your subroutine with `Dim query As String` and `Dim currentSheet As String`.

2. You're trying to use `query` as both a string (when you assign it the value of a cell) and as a `WorkbookQuery` object (when you use `query.Name`). You should only use it as a string, since you're getting the query from a cell.

3. The `Location` in the connection string should be the name of the query in Power Query, not the value of the query itself. If you're storing the name of the query in a cell, you can use that.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As String

    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value 'here is where my query from power query is. I put the text from power query advanced editor in another sheet cell.
    currentSheet = ActiveSheet.Name

    With ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code assumes that the name of your Power Query query is stored in cell A1 of Sheet6. If you're storing the actual M code of the query in that cell, you'll need to create the query in VBA before you can use it,
