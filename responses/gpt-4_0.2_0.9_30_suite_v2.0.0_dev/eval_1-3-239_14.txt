Sure, here is a bash script that will install Python 3.6.5 using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink current Python
brew unlink python

# Install Python 3.6.5
brew install python@3.6

# Link Python 3.6.5
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will unlink your current Python version, install Python 3.6.5, and then link Python 3.6.5. If you have other versions of Python installed and linked, this may affect them.
