The error message you're seeing is because ESLint is trying to find the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file. If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory, you'll need to provide the correct path to it in your `.eslintrc.js` file.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have this line:

```javascript
project: "tsconfig.json",
```

This tells ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file. If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory, you'll need to provide the correct path to it.

For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project, and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would change the line to:

```javascript
project: "../tsconfig.json",
```

Or, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in a different subdirectory, you would provide the path to that subdirectory:

```javascript
project: "../path/to/tsconfig.json",
```

Make sure to replace `"../path/to/tsconfig.json"` with the actual path to your `tsconfig.json` file.

After making this change, save your `.eslintrc.js` file and restart your editor. The error message should no longer appear.
