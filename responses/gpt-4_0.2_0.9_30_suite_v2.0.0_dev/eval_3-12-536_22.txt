You can use `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton` and `TextButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which placed in the `style` property.

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with border-radius in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20), // radius of 20
    ),
  ),
  onPressed: () {
    print('Button pressed!');
  },
  child: Text('Button'),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton.styleFrom` is used to define the style of the button. The `shape` property is set to `RoundedRectangleBorder` with a `borderRadius` of 20. This will create a button with rounded corners. The `onPressed` function will be called when the button is pressed.
