Sure, you can't directly combine two mapped types in TypeScript. You need to use intersection (`&`) to combine them. Here is the corrected code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type `FruitsAndColors` where each fruit key is a number and each color key is a boolean.
