It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a web-developer's toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow. It's a plugin for many popular text editors which greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow.

For example, if you type `.classname` and hit `Tab`, it will automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`. This is a feature of Emmet.

If this isn't working for you, it's possible that either:

1. You don't have Emmet installed or enabled in your text editor.
2. Your text editor doesn't support Emmet.
3. You're not using the correct shortcut to expand the abbreviation (usually it's the `Tab` key, but it might be different in your editor).

To solve this:

1. Check if your text editor supports Emmet. If it does, make sure it's installed and enabled.
2. Check the documentation for your text editor to see what the shortcut is for expanding Emmet abbreviations.
3. If your text editor doesn't support Emmet, consider switching to one that does. Some popular choices are Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. All of these support Emmet.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
