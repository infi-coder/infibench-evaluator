The warning message you're seeing is due to Elasticsearch 7.13.1 not having its built-in security features enabled. This is not an error, but a warning from Elasticsearch about potential security risks.

If you want to enable the built-in security features, you can follow the instructions in the link provided in the warning message: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html

However, if you're running Elasticsearch locally for development purposes, it's usually not necessary to enable these security features. If you want to suppress this warning, you can do so by setting the `xpack.security.enabled` setting to `false` in your `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file.

Here's how to do it:

1. Open the `elasticsearch.yml` file. This file is typically located in the `/etc/elasticsearch` or `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory, depending on how you installed Elasticsearch.

2. Add the following line to the file:

    ```yml
    xpack.security.enabled: false
    ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

Please note that this will only suppress the warning, and will not enable the security features. If you're running Elasticsearch in a production environment, it's strongly recommended to enable these features to protect your data.
