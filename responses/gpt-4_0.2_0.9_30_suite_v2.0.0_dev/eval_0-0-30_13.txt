Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17. You can use `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. Here is how you can adapt your code:

First, install the adapter:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can use it in your code like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Please note that this is an unofficial adapter, and it may not support all features or have the same level of maintenance as the official adapters. The official adapter for React 17 is not yet available at the time of writing.
