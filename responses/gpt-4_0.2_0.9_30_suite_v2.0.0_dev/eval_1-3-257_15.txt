Here is a Python function that divides an even number into N parts, each part being a multiple of 2:

```python
def divideNumber(num, n):
    # Calculate the base value and the remainder
    base = num // n
    remainder = num % n

    # Ensure the base value is a multiple of 2
    if base % 2 != 0:
        base -= 1
        remainder += n

    # Create the result list with the base value
    result = [base] * n

    # Distribute the remainder
    i = 0
    while remainder > 0:
        result[i] += 2
        remainder -= 2
        i = (i + 1) % n

    return result
```

This function first calculates the base value and the remainder. It then ensures that the base value is a multiple of 2 by subtracting 1 if necessary and adding the subtracted value to the remainder. It then creates a list with the base value and distributes the remainder by adding 2 to each element in the list in a round-robin fashion.

Here is how you can use this function:

```python
print(divideNumber(100, 3))  # Output: [34, 34, 32]
```

This function works for any even number and any number of parts. However, it assumes that the number of parts is less than or equal to the number itself. If the number of parts is greater than the number, it will return a list with zeros and the remainder will be lost.
