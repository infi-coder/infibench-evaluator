The error message `FormatException: Unexpected character (at character 1)` typically means that the response you're getting from your server is not a valid JSON string.

Here are some steps you can take to debug and solve this issue:

1. **Check the response**: Print the response body before trying to decode it. This will help you see exactly what you're trying to decode.

    ```dart
    print('Response body: ${response.body}');
    ```

2. **Check the server-side script**: Make sure your PHP script is returning a valid JSON. You can use online JSON validators to check the output of your PHP script.

3. **Check the response status code**: Before decoding the response, check the status code to make sure the request was successful.

    ```dart
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      List data = json.decode(response.body);
    } else {
      print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}.');
    }
    ```

4. **Catch the exception**: You can catch the `FormatException` to prevent it from crashing your app and print the error message.

    ```dart
    try {
      List data = json.decode(response.body);
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error: $e');
    }
    ```

Remember that the response from the server must be a valid JSON string. If the server returns anything else (like an error message, or HTML), `json.decode` will throw a `FormatException`.
