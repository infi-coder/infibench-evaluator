The error you're seeing is due to Laravel's built-in CSRF protection. When you log out from one tab, the session is invalidated. So when you try to log out from the other tab, the CSRF token associated with that session is no longer valid, hence the 419 error.

To handle this, you can modify your logout method to not require CSRF protection. You can do this by adding the route to the `$except` array in your `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware.

Here's how you can do it:

```php
namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken as Middleware;

class VerifyCsrfToken extends Middleware
{
    /**
     * The URIs that should be excluded from CSRF verification.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $except = [
        '/logout',
    ];
}
```

This will exclude the `/logout` route from CSRF verification, so you won't get a 419 error when you try to log out from a session that's already been invalidated.

However, please note that disabling CSRF protection can expose your application to cross-site request forgery attacks. So use this solution with caution and only if you understand the implications.
