Sure, here is your revised code:

```javascript
const MongoStore = require('connect-mongo');

...

app.use(session({
    secret: 'story book',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: MongoStore.create({ mongoUrl: process.env.MONGODB_URI })
}))
```
The `connect-mongo` package has changed its API in version 4. Now, instead of passing the mongoose connection to the `MongoStore` constructor, you should use the `create` method and pass an options object with the `mongoUrl` property.
