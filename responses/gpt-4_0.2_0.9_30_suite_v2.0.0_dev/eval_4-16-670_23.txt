Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key. Here are the steps:

1. Convert OpenSSH private key to RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will ask you for the passphrase (if any) of the key, and then rewrite the key in the RSA format. The `-p` option tells `ssh-keygen` to change the passphrase of a private key file, `-m PEM` tells it to use the older PEM private key format instead of the new OpenSSH format, and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file of the key to read.

2. Regarding your second question, you don't need to convert the public key. The public key format is standard and doesn't have the same OpenSSH vs RSA format issue. The public key file (`id_rsa.pub`) can be used as is.

Remember, you should only perform these operations on a secure, trusted machine, as they involve handling of private keys.
