The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` is generated by the `bootJar` task of the Spring Boot Gradle plugin. It's the non-executable jar without the embedded container.

If you want to disable the generation of the `plain.jar` file, you can configure the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file to disable the `enabled` property of the `archiveClassifier` 'plain' as follows:

```groovy
bootJar {
    archiveClassifier.set('plain') {
        enabled = false
    }
}
```

But please note that this is not a recommended practice as the `plain.jar` might be useful in certain scenarios, such as when you want to deploy your application to a standalone servlet container.
