Yes, in Flutter, you can draw vertical lines between components using the `VerticalDivider` widget. This widget creates a material design vertical divider.

Here is a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line is drawn between two text components. The `VerticalDivider` widget takes several parameters:

- `color`: This defines the color of the line.
- `thickness`: This defines the thickness of the line.
- `width`: This defines the width of the space where the line is drawn.

Remember that `VerticalDivider` is a widget itself, so it should be included in the widget tree. It's not a property that you can add to an existing widget.
