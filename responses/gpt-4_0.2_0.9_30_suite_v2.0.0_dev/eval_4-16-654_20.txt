You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by using the `ssh-add` command. However, before you do that, you need to start the ssh-agent in the background.

Here are the steps:

1. Start Git Bash.
2. Start the ssh-agent in the background:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace `id_rsa` in the command with the name of your private key file.

```bash
ssh-add D:/keys/id_rsa
```

Now, your SSH key is added to the Git Bash and you should be able to clone the repository from the remote.

Please note that the key must be in OpenSSH format for `ssh-add` to accept it. If it's not, you'll need to convert it using PuTTYgen. Open PuTTYgen, load your key, and then save it as an OpenSSH key.
