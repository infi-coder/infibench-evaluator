The error you're seeing is because the version of `pdftk` you're trying to use is not compatible with your version of MacOS. This is a common issue with MacOS Catalina and later versions because they dropped support for 32-bit applications.

Here are the steps to solve this issue:

1. Uninstall the current version of `pdftk` if it's installed.

```bash
brew uninstall pdftk
```

2. Install `pdftk-java` which is a reimplementation of `pdftk` in Java.

```bash
brew install pdftk-java
```

3. Create a symbolic link to `pdftk-java` as `pdftk`.

```bash
ln -s /usr/local/bin/pdftk.java /usr/local/bin/pdftk
```

Now you should be able to use `pdftk` as before. If you get a `permission denied` error when trying to create the symbolic link, you may need to run the command with `sudo`.

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/pdftk.java /usr/local/bin/pdftk
```

Please note that `pdftk-java` requires Java 7 or later to be installed on your system. If you don't have Java installed, you can install it using Homebrew.

```bash
brew cask install java
```
