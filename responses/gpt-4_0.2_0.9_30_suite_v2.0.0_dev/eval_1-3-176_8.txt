The error message indicates that the Pillow library could not find the headers or library files for zlib, which is a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source.

However, the issue you are facing could be due to the fact that you are trying to install an older version of Pillow (6.0.0) which does not support Python 3.8. The warning message in your error log indicates this:

```bash
C:\Users\rijal\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-install-di5is9gd\Pillow\setup.py:29: RuntimeWarning: Pillow does not yet support Python 3.8 and does not yet provide prebuilt Windows binaries. We do not recommend building from source on Windows.
```

To solve this issue, you should try to install the latest version of Pillow which supports Python 3.8. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pillow
```

This command will upgrade Pillow to the latest version. If you still encounter issues, you might need to install the zlib development files. The process to do this varies depending on your operating system. For Windows, you might need to install a package like zlib-devel using a package manager like Chocolatey or Scoop.
