The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to use Flutter's engine bindings before they've been initialized. This is because you're calling `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` at the top level of your application, which is executed before `runApp()`.

To fix this, you need to ensure that `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` is called before you use `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`. This method ensures that Flutter's engine bindings are properly initialized.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // add this line
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This should resolve the error you're encountering.
