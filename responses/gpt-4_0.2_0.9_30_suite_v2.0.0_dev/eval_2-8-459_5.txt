The error message you're seeing indicates that Go is unable to find the specific version of the module you're requesting. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as network issues, incorrect configuration, or access control.

Here are a few steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. **Check your network connection:** Ensure that you have a stable internet connection and that you're able to access the GitHub repository from your browser.

2. **Check your Go version:** Make sure you're using a version of Go that supports modules. Go modules were introduced in Go 1.11, so you'll need to be using at least this version. You can check your Go version by running `go version` in your terminal.

3. **Check your GitHub credentials:** Make sure that your GitHub credentials are correctly configured on your machine. You can do this by running `git config --global --get user.name` and `git config --global --get user.email` in your terminal. If these commands don't return your GitHub username and email, you'll need to configure them.

4. **Check your Go environment variables:** Go uses several environment variables to control its behavior. You can check your current Go environment variables by running `go env` in your terminal. In particular, check the values of `GOPATH`, `GO111MODULE`, `GOPROXY`, and `GOSUMDB`.

5. **Check your module's go.mod file:** Make sure that the module path and version in your go.mod file match those in the GitHub repository. If they don't, you'll need to update your go.mod file.

6. **Try to download the module manually:** You can try to download the module manually by running `go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5` in your terminal. If this command fails, it should give you more information about why Go is unable to download the module.

7. **Check access to the private repository:** If the repository is private, you need to ensure that the machine has access to it. This usually involves setting up SSH keys or token-based authentication.

8. **Clear your Go module cache:** Sometimes, your Go module cache can get into a bad state. You can clear your Go module cache by running `go clean -modcache` in your terminal.

Remember to replace `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5` with the
