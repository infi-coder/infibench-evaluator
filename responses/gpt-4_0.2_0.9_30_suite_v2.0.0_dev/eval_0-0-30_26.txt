Yes, there is an unofficial adapter available for React 17. It's called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. You can install it using npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can use it in your code like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

This adapter is not officially supported by the Enzyme team, but it is widely used in the community until an official adapter for React 17 is released.
