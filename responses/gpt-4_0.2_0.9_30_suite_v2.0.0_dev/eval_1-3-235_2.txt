The error you're encountering is because the 'year' column contains float values represented as strings, and you're trying to convert them directly to integers. 

You can solve this by first converting the strings to floats, and then converting the floats to integers. Here is the function:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

This function will convert the 'year' column to float first, then to integer, and return the modified dataframe.
