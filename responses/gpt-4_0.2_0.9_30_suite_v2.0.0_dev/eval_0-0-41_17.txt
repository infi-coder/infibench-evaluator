The `navigator.geolocation` object is available in most modern browsers, so the `else` block in your code will not be executed unless the user is using a very old or unsupported browser.

The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method is asynchronous and it takes two callback functions as arguments. The first callback function is executed when the location is successfully obtained, and the second callback function is executed when there is an error.

In your case, you want to log "User not allowed" when the user denies the location permission. This is considered an error, so you should put your `console.log("User not allowed")` in the error callback function.

Here is the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the user allows the location permission, "Location accessed" will be logged. If the user denies the location permission, "User not allowed" will be logged. If the user's browser does not support geolocation at all, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged.
