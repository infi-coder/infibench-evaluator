This error usually occurs when Xcode can't find the target for the SwiftUI preview. Here are some steps you can try to fix it:

1. **Ensure the file is part of the target**: In Xcode, select the file that contains your `ContentView_Previews` struct. In the file inspector on the right, under "Target Membership", make sure your app's target is checked.

2. **Clean the build folder**: Go to `Product > Clean Build Folder` or press `Shift + Command + K`.

3. **Restart Xcode**: Sometimes, Xcode can get into a weird state, and a simple restart can fix the problem.

4. **Reset iOS Simulator**: If you're using a simulator, try resetting it. Go to `Simulator > Reset Content and Settings...`.

5. **Update Xcode**: If you're not on the latest version of Xcode, consider updating. Apple often fixes bugs in new releases.

6. **Create a new SwiftUI View**: If none of the above works, try creating a new SwiftUI View and see if the preview works there. If it does, you can move your code over to the new file.

Remember to rebuild your project after each step to check if the problem is resolved.
