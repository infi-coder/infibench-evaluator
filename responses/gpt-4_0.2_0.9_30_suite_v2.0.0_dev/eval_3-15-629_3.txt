You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. Here's a simple function to copy text to the clipboard:

```vba
Sub CopyTextToClipboard(text As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText text
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
End Sub
```

You can use this function like this:

```vba
CopyTextToClipboard Me.NodeKey.Value
```

Note: This requires a reference to the Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library. You can add this reference via Tools -> References in the VBA editor, then check "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library".
