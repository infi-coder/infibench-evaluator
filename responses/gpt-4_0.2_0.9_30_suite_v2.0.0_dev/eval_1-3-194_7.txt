You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write data into an Excel file. Here is the function `writeToExcel()` that you asked for:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = Workbook()  # Create a new workbook
    ws = wb.active  # Get the active worksheet

    # Write data into the worksheet
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
            ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

    # Save the workbook as 'data.xlsx'
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new Excel workbook, gets the active worksheet, writes the data from `new_list` into the worksheet, and then saves the workbook as 'data.xlsx'. The `ws.cell()` method is used to write data into a specific cell, where `row` and `column` are the cell coordinates and `value` is the data to be written. The cell coordinates are 1-indexed, so we add 1 to the list indices.
