You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command reads and executes the `.bash_profile` file in the current shell. The `~` symbol is a shortcut for your home directory.

If you've made changes to the `.bash_profile`, this will apply them to your current terminal session. 

Alternatively, you can use the `.` command, which is a shorthand for `source`:

```bash
. ~/.bash_profile
```

These commands won't restart your terminal, but they will apply any new changes you've made to your `.bash_profile`.
