The error you're seeing is because ESLint is trying to find the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file. If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory, you'll need to provide the correct relative path to it.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have the following line:

```javascript
project: "tsconfig.json",
```

This tells ESLint to look for `tsconfig.json` in the same directory as `.eslintrc.js`. If `tsconfig.json` is not in the same directory, you'll need to provide the correct path.

For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would change the line to:

```javascript
project: "../tsconfig.json",
```

Or, if both files are in the root directory, you would use:

```javascript
project: "./tsconfig.json",
```

Adjust the path according to your project structure. After making the change, save the `.eslintrc.js` file and restart your editor. The error should be resolved.
