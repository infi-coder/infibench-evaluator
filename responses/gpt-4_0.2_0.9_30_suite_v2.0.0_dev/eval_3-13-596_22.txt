Yes, you can disallow Gradle from generating the `*.plain.jar` file by disabling the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file. 

Here's how you can do it:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will prevent the generation of the `*.plain.jar` file. However, please note that this will also disable the generation of the executable jar file (`myprogram-0.0.1.jar`). 

If you want to keep the executable jar and only remove the `*.plain.jar`, you can do it by disabling the `jar` task instead:

```groovy
jar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will only generate the executable jar (`myprogram-0.0.1.jar`) and not the `*.plain.jar`.
