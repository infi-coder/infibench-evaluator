The error message indicates that the `aws-sdk-js` package could not be found in the npm registry. This is because the package name is incorrect. The correct package name for the AWS SDK for JavaScript is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`.

You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

This should resolve your issue. If you still encounter problems, make sure your network connection is stable and that the npm registry is not currently down (you can check at [npm status](https://status.npmjs.org/)).
