You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write to an Excel file. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install openpyxl
```

Here is the `writeToExcel` function:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = Workbook()

    # grab the active worksheet
    ws = wb.active

    # write rows to the active worksheet
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        ws.append(new_list[i])

    # Save the file
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new Excel file named "data.xlsx" and writes the contents of `new_list` into the file. Each sublist in `new_list` is written as a new row in the Excel file.
