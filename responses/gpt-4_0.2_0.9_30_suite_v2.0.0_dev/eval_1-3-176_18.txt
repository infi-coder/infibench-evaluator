The error message indicates that the zlib library, which is a required dependency for Pillow, could not be found. 

However, the Pillow version you are trying to install (6.0.0) does not support Python 3.8. You can see this warning in your error message:

```bash
C:\Users\rijal\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-install-di5is9gd\Pillow\setup.py:29: RuntimeWarning: Pillow does not yet support Python 3.8 and does not yet provide prebuilt Windows binaries. We do not recommend building from source on Windows.
```

To solve this issue, you should try installing a newer version of Pillow that supports Python 3.8. You can do this by simply running:

```bash
pip install pillow --upgrade
```

This command will install the latest version of Pillow. If you still encounter issues, it may be due to a problem with your Python environment or pip installation. In that case, you might want to consider re-installing Python or setting up a new virtual environment.
