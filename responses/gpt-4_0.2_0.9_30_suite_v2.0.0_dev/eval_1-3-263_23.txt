The `f` before the string in the `print` function is used to denote a f-string, which is a feature introduced in Python 3.6. It stands for "formatted string literals". 

F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting. 

Here's how it works:

```python
name = "John"
print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

In this example, the expression inside the curly braces `{}` is evaluated and its result is inserted into the string. The output will be:

```
Hello, John
```

In your code:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

`args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` are expressions that get evaluated and their results are inserted into the string. So if `args.input_directory` is `/home/user/input` and `args.output_directory` is `/home/user/output`, the output will be:

```
Input directory: /home/user/input
Output directory: /home/user/output
```
