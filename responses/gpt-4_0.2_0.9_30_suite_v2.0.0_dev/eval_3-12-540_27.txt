Yes, Flutter does provide a way to draw vertical lines between components. You can use the `VerticalDivider` widget for this purpose. 

Here is an example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line (divider) is drawn between two text components. The `VerticalDivider` widget has properties like `color`, `thickness`, and `width` which you can adjust according to your needs. 

Please note that `VerticalDivider` is only visible when used in a `Row` widget. It won't show up if you use it in a `Column` widget.
