Sure, the issue with your code is that TypeScript does not allow you to use the same index signature (`[key in ...]`) twice in the same type. You can fix this by combining your `fruit` and `color` types into a single type using intersection (`&`):

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type that has a numeric property for each fruit and a boolean property for each color.
