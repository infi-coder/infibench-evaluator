Unfortunately, Excel VBA doesn't provide a direct way to retrieve the local path of a file that is synced with OneDrive or SharePoint. The "Open File Location" button you mentioned is a feature of Excel's user interface and doesn't have a corresponding VBA method.

However, you can use a workaround to get the local path of the synced file. OneDrive and SharePoint files are synced to a local folder, usually under the user's profile directory. You can use the `Environ` function in VBA to get the user's profile directory, and then append the relative path of the OneDrive or SharePoint folder.

Here is a simple example:

```vba
Dim localPath As String
localPath = Environ("USERPROFILE") & "\OneDrive - YourOrganizationName\YourFilePath"
```

Replace "YourOrganizationName" and "YourFilePath" with your actual organization name and file path.

Please note that this method assumes that all users have their OneDrive or SharePoint files synced to the default location. If a user has changed the sync location, this method will not return the correct path.

As for creating folders and files on SharePoint using VBA, you might need to use SharePoint's REST API or WebDAV, which is more complex and requires knowledge of HTTP requests and possibly XML or JSON. It's also worth noting that interacting with SharePoint in this way might be restricted by your organization's IT policies.
