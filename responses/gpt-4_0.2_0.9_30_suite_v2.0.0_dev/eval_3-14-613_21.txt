This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being associated with the correct target. Here's how you can fix it:

1. Open the file that contains your `ContentView_Previews`.
2. In the File Inspector (the first tab in the right sidebar), under "Target Membership", make sure that the checkbox next to your target is checked.

If that doesn't work, try the following:

1. Clean your project (Product > Clean Build Folder).
2. Quit Xcode.
3. Delete derived data (you can find the location in Xcode > Preferences > Locations).
4. Restart your Mac.
5. Open your project and try again.

If none of the above solutions work, it might be a bug in Xcode 12.3. You can try updating to a newer version of Xcode if available, or report the issue to Apple.
