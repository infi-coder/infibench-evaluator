AWS CLI version 2 introduced automatic paging for commands that return long lists of output. This is why you're seeing the interactive pager. You can disable this feature by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string.

You can do this in your bash script like so:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  AWS_PAGER="" aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

Or you can set the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string in your shell profile (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash) to disable the pager for all AWS CLI commands:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

After adding this line to your shell profile, you'll need to source the file or restart your shell session for the change to take effect.

If you want to pipe the return values into a separate file, you can do so by appending `> filename.txt` to the end of your command:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  AWS_PAGER="" aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > output.txt; 
done
```

This will write the output of each command to `output.txt`, overwriting the file each time. If you want to append to the file instead of overwriting it, use `>>` instead of `>`:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  AWS_PAGER="" aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo >> output.txt; 
done
```
