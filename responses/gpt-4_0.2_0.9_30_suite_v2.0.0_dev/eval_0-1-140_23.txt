In Font Awesome 5, the font-family has been split into different styles. You have to specify the style you want to use. The styles are:

- "Font Awesome 5 Free" for solid icons
- "Font Awesome 5 Brands" for brand icons
- "Font Awesome 5 Regular" for regular icons

The unicode for the icon you are using (`\f107`) corresponds to the "angle-down" icon in the solid style. So, you should use "Font Awesome 5 Free" as the font-family and also specify the font-weight as 900 (which corresponds to the solid style). Here is how you can modify your code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

Remember to include the Font Awesome 5 CSS in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.13/css/all.css">
```
