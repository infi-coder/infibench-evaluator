The problem you're experiencing is due to the fact that WSL2 is trying to use the Windows version of `npm` instead of the Linux version. This is because the Windows directories are in your PATH variable.

To solve this, you need to make sure that the Linux directories are prioritized in your PATH variable. You can do this by editing your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file.

Here are the steps to do this:

1. Open your `.bashrc` file:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"
```

3. Save and close the file by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

4. Reload the `.bashrc` file:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

5. Now, you should be able to use `npm` without any issues. You can check the version of `npm` by running:

```bash
npm -v
```

If you still face the same issue, you can try to reinstall `npm` using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

Then check the version of `npm` again.
