The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. Without enabling these features, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. The location of this file depends on your installation. If you installed Elasticsearch with Homebrew, the file is usually located at `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`.

2. Add the following lines to the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

If you're running Elasticsearch in a Docker container, you can pass these configuration options as environment variables when you start the container. Here's an example:

```bash
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" -e "xpack.security.enabled=true" -e "xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled=true" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.13.1
```

Please note that enabling security will require you to set up user authentication. You can follow the guide provided in the warning message to set up minimal security for Elasticsearch: [Elasticsearch Minimal Security Setup](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html)

If you don't want to enable security and just want to suppress the warning, you can add the following line to your `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: false
```

Then save the file and restart Elasticsearch. This will disable the security features and suppress the warning, but it's not recommended for production environments.
