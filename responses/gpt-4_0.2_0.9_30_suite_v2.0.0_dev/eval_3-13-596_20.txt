Yes, you can disallow Gradle to generate the `*.plain.jar` file. The `*.plain.jar` file is generated by the `bootJar` task in Spring Boot 2.5.0. You can disable it in your `build.gradle` file by adding the following configuration:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will prevent the `bootJar` task from running, and thus the `*.plain.jar` file will not be generated.
