You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you've made changes to your `.bash_profile`, this will apply them to your current terminal session.

If you're using a different shell like `zsh`, you might have a `.zshrc` file instead. In that case, you would use:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

In general, you can use the `source` command followed by the path to any script you want to run in the current shell context.
