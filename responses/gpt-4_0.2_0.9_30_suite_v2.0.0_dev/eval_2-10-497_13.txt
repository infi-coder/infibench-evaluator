In Rust, you don't have null pointers like in C or C++. Instead, you have the `Option` type which can be `Some` or `None`. So, you can use `Option<Box<Node>>` to represent a nullable pointer. Here is how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

In this case, `None` is equivalent to a null pointer. You can check if a `Box<Node>` is `None` like this:

```rust
if let Some(node) = &stack.top {
    // stack.top is not None
} else {
    // stack.top is None
}
```

Or like this:

```rust
match &stack.top {
    Some(node) => {
        // stack.top is not None
    }
    None => {
        // stack.top is None
    }
}
```

Or like this:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    // stack.top is None
}
```

Or like this:

```rust
if stack.top.is_some() {
    // stack.top is not None
}
```
