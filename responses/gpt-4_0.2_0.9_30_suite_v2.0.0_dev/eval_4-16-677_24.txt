The issue you're facing is due to the single quotes around the `$searchT` variable. In Bash, single quotes preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes, which means the variable `$searchT` is not being expanded to its value.

You should use double quotes instead. Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

In this script, `$searchT` will be correctly expanded to the value that the user inputs. Also, I've moved `wc -l` to only count the lines from the `grep` command, not from the `cat` command. This will give you the correct count of matches.
