Yes, in Flutter, you can draw vertical lines between components using the `VerticalDivider` widget. 

Here is a simple example of how you can use it:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 2'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 3'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, `VerticalDivider` is used to draw vertical lines between three text widgets. You can customize the color and thickness of the line by using the `color` and `thickness` properties respectively.

Please note that `VerticalDivider` is a widget that displays a vertical line with a thickness defined by `thickness` and color defined by `color`. It's always centered within its parent. This widget takes up space along the main axis (height in this case) and it's constrained by the `width` parameter.
