Sure, you can't directly combine two mapped types in TypeScript. Instead, you can use the `&` operator to create an intersection type. Here is the correct definition:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This type `FruitsAndColors` now has a numeric property for each fruit and a boolean property for each color.
