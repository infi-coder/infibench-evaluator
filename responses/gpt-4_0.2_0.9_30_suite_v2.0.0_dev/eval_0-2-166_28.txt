Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would in traditional CSS. It doesn't support selectors like `div.section > div` because it's not a preprocessor like SASS or Less, but rather a utility class generator.

However, you can still apply Tailwind CSS classes to your child elements directly in your HTML:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-red-500"> <!-- Tailwind CSS classes here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

If you need to apply styles based on parent-child relationships, you might need to use JavaScript or a JavaScript framework like React, Vue, or Angular to conditionally apply classes.

Alternatively, you can use `@apply` directive in your CSS file to apply a set of styles to a specific selector:

```css
div.section > div {
  @apply bg-red-500; /* Tailwind CSS classes here */
}
```

Remember that this requires enabling the `@apply` directive in your Tailwind CSS configuration, and it also requires a build process that supports PostCSS.
