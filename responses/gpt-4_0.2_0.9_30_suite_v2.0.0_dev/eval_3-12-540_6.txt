Yes, in Flutter you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here is an example of how you can use it:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line is drawn between two text components. The `VerticalDivider` widget takes in parameters for color, thickness, and width to customize the appearance of the line. 

Note: `VerticalDivider` is only visible when used in a `Row` widget. If you use it in a `Column` widget, it will not be visible because it will have a height of 0.
