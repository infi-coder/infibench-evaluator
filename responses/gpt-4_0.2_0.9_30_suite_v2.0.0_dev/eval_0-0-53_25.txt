The issue with your code is that you're trying to use inline JavaScript in a React component. React uses a virtual DOM and has its own event system, so inline JavaScript doesn't work as expected. 

Instead, you should use React's event handling system. Here's how you can modify your code to display the alert when the button is clicked:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'

class Main extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      imageURL: '',
    };

    this.handleUploadImage = this.handleUploadImage.bind(this);
  }

  handleUploadImage(ev) {
    ev.preventDefault();

    const data = new FormData();
    data.append('file', this.uploadInput.files[0]);
    data.append('filename', this.fileName.value);

    fetch('http://localhost:8000/upload', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: data,
    }).then((response) => {
      response.json().then((body) => {
        this.setState({ imageURL: `http://localhost:8000/${body.file}` });
      });
    });

    alert("Your file is being uploaded!");
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleUploadImage}>
        <div>
          <input ref={(ref) => { this.uploadInput = ref; }} type="file" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <input ref={(ref) => { this.fileName = ref; }} type="text" placeholder="Enter the desired name of file" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          <button type="submit">Upload</button>
        </div>
        <img src={this.state.imageURL} alt="img" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}

export default Main;
```

In this code, I've removed the inline JavaScript and added the `alert` call to the `handleUploadImage` method. This method is called when the form is submitted, which happens when the button is clicked. I've also changed the `button` element to have `type="submit"` to make sure the form is submitted when it's clicked.
