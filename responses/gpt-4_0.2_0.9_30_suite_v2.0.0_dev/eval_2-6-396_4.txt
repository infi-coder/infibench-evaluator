The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. In EF Core, you can only create indexes on scalar properties.

So, you should change your `OnModelCreating` method to this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId); // Change this line
    });
}
```

In this code, an index is created on the `GenderId` property, which is a scalar property, instead of the `Gender` navigation property.
