The error you're seeing is due to a change in Android 12 (API level 31) that requires you to specify whether a `PendingIntent` is mutable or immutable when you create it. This change is intended to improve app security.

The `MediaSessionCompat` class in the AndroidX Media library creates a `PendingIntent` internally, and it seems like it's not yet updated to handle this requirement properly.

While the AndroidX team is working on a fix, you can use a temporary workaround by setting the target SDK version (`targetSdkVersion`) in your `build.gradle` file to 30 or below. This will bypass the new requirement in Android 12.

Here is how you can do it:

```groovy
android {
    compileSdkVersion 31

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.example.myapp"
        minSdkVersion 21
        targetSdkVersion 30
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
    ...
}
```

Please note that this is just a temporary solution. You should monitor the updates to the AndroidX Media library and update your app to target API level 31 as soon as the library is fixed.
