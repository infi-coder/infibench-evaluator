The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. That's why you can't install it using `composer require`.

If you're on a Unix-like system (like Ubuntu), you can install it via the terminal with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you're on Windows, you can enable it in your `php.ini` file by uncommenting (or adding) the line:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing or enabling the extension, you may need to restart your web server for the changes to take effect.

In your `composer.json`, you can specify that your project requires this extension with:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1",
    "ext-zip": "*"
}
```

This won't install the extension, but it will prevent `composer install` from succeeding if the extension isn't installed, which can be useful if other people are going to be running your project.
