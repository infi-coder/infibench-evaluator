It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a code editor called Emmet. Emmet is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allow for high-speed coding and editing in HTML, XML, CSS, and other web development languages.

The feature you're referring to is a shorthand syntax where you can type `.classname` and then hit `Tab` to automatically generate `<div class="classname"></div>`. 

Here are some steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check your code editor**: Not all code editors support Emmet out of the box. Popular editors like VS Code, Sublime Text, and Atom do. If you're using a different editor, you might need to install an Emmet plugin.

2. **Check your file type**: Emmet usually works automatically in HTML and CSS files. If you're working in a different file type, Emmet might not be activated.

3. **Check your syntax**: Make sure you're typing `.classname` and then hitting `Tab`. If you're doing something slightly different, it might not work.

4. **Check your Emmet settings**: In some editors, you can customize Emmet's behavior. If you or someone else has changed the settings, the `.classname` shortcut might not work as expected.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more details about your setup (like which code editor you're using) and we can provide more specific advice.
