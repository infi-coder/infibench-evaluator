The `Get-Service` cmdlet in PowerShell does not provide the description of the service. However, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to get the description of the service. Here is an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service" | Select-Object Name, Description | Out-GridView
```

This command will display the name and description of all services in a grid view.

If you want to get the description of a specific service, you can filter the results by the service name. For example, to get the description of the "wuauserv" service, you can use the following command:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service Where Name = 'wuauserv'" | Select-Object Name, Description
```

This command will display the name and description of the "wuauserv" service.
