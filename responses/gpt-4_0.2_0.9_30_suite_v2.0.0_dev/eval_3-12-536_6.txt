You can use `TextButton`, `ElevatedButton`, and `OutlinedButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property. 

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with a border radius in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  style: ButtonStyle(
    shape: MaterialStateProperty.all<RoundedRectangleBorder>(
      RoundedRectangleBorder(
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(30.0),
      )
    )
  ),
  onPressed: () {},
  child: Text('Button'),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton` is used, but you can replace it with `TextButton` or `OutlinedButton` as per your requirements. The `shape` property is used to define the shape of the button. The `RoundedRectangleBorder` widget is used to make the button's corners rounded. The `borderRadius` property is used to specify the radius of the corners. The `onPressed` property is used to specify the function that will be executed when the button is pressed. The `child` property is used to specify the content of the button.
