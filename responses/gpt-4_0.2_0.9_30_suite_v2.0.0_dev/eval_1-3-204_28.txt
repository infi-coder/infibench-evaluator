The `rename` function is used to rename the DataFrame's index or columns. However, in your case, you are trying to rename the Series object returned by the `mean` function, which doesn't have a `columns` attribute.

Here is the correct way to rename the column:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg.rename(columns = {"p":"mean"}, inplace=True)
    return avg
```

In this function, `reset_index` is used to convert the index into a column, and then `rename` is used to rename the column. The `inplace=True` argument is used to make the changes in the DataFrame itself without returning a new DataFrame.
