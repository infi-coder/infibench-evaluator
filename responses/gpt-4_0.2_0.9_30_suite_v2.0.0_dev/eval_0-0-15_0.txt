Sure, the issue here is that you're trying to instantiate a class from an object. The mock should return a function that can be used as a constructor. Here's the revised version:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this revised version, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` returns a mock function that can be used as a constructor. When you call `new API()`, it will return an object with a `someMethod` function.
