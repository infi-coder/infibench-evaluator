Your code seems fine at first glance. The issue might not be in your code but could be related to the network, the server, or the Apollo Client setup. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. **Check your network connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. You can test this by trying to fetch some other public API.

2. **Check the server**: The server you're trying to fetch data from might be down or not responding. You can check this by trying to fetch data from the server outside of your app, for example using a tool like Postman or even just your browser.

3. **Check the Apollo Client setup**: Ensure that your Apollo Client is set up correctly. The URI you're using seems to be a sandbox server provided by Apollo for testing, so it should work fine. However, you can try to replace it with another GraphQL server to see if it makes a difference.

4. **Check the query**: Ensure that your GraphQL query is correct and returns the expected data. You can test this by running the query directly on the server (if it provides a GraphQL playground or similar tool).

5. **Check the error and data**: You're already logging the `error` and `data` returned by `useQuery`, but you might want to inspect them more closely. If `error` is `undefined`, it means that no error occurred (or at least none that Apollo Client could catch). If `data` is `undefined`, it means that no data was returned. This could be because the query is still loading, or because the query completed but didn't return any data (which might indicate an issue with the query or the server).

6. **Check the Apollo Client version**: Ensure that you're using a compatible version of Apollo Client. The latest version at the time of writing is 3.5.10, which is the one you're using. However, if you're following a tutorial or guide, it might be using an older version, and there might be breaking changes.

7. **Check for other issues**: If none of the above steps help, there might be some other issue. You can try to create a minimal reproduction of the issue and ask for help on a platform like Stack Overflow or the Apollo Client GitHub repository.
