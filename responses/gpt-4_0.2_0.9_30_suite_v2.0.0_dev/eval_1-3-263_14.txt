The `f` before the string in the `print` function is used to create what's called an f-string (formatted string literal) in Python. This was introduced in Python 3.6.

F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting. 

Here's how it works:

- You write an `f` before the string.
- Variables can be included directly in the string in curly braces `{}`.
- The variables in the curly braces are evaluated at runtime and formatted into the string.

In your example:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

The `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` are expressions that get evaluated and their results are inserted into the string at those positions. 

So if `args.input_directory` is `/home/user/input` and `args.output_directory` is `/home/user/output`, the output of the `print` statements would be:

```
Input directory: /home/user/input
Output directory: /home/user/output
```
