The error you're encountering is related to the version of Maven bundled with IntelliJ IDEA. It seems that IntelliJ IDEA's bundled Maven version is not compatible with the version of Maven used in the Spring Boot project generated by start.spring.io.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: Make sure you're using the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA. JetBrains regularly releases updates that include bug fixes and compatibility improvements.

2. **Use an external Maven**: Instead of using the bundled Maven, you can configure IntelliJ IDEA to use an external Maven installation. Here's how:

    - Download and install the appropriate version of Maven from the [official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
    - In IntelliJ IDEA, go to `File > Settings` (or `IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences` on macOS).
    - In the Settings/Preferences dialog, go to `Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven`.
    - In the Maven home directory field, specify the path to the Maven installation directory.

3. **Re-import the project**: After changing the Maven settings, re-import the project in IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by right-clicking on the `pom.xml` file in the project explorer and selecting `Maven > Reimport`.

If the problem persists after trying these steps, it might be a bug in IntelliJ IDEA or in the Spring Initializr service. In that case, consider reporting the issue to JetBrains or the Spring Boot team.
