In Rust, you can't set a default value for a field in a struct that doesn't implement the `Default` trait. The `TcpStream` struct doesn't implement the `Default` trait, so you can't set a default value for it.

However, you can use `Option<TcpStream>` instead of `TcpStream` for the `conn` field. This way, you can set the default value of `conn` to `None` and change it to `Some(TcpStream)` when you connect to the server.

Here's how you can do it:

```rust
use std::net::TcpStream;

pub struct FistClient {
    addr: String,
    conn: Option<TcpStream>,
}

impl FistClient {
    pub fn new(ip: &str, port: &str) -> Self {
        FistClient {
            addr: String::from(ip) + ":" + &String::from(port),
            conn: None,
        }
    }

    pub fn connect(&mut self) {
        let res = TcpStream::connect(&self.addr);
        match res {
            Ok(c) => self.conn = Some(c),
            Err(_) => panic!(),
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, `conn` is an `Option<TcpStream>`. In the `new` method, `conn` is set to `None`. In the `connect` method, `conn` is set to `Some(c)` if the connection is successful.
