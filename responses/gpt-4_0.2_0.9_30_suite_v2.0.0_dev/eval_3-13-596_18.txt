Yes, you can disable the generation of the `*-plain.jar` file. This is a new feature in Spring Boot 2.5.0 that generates a jar without the embedded container. If you don't need it, you can disable it by adding the following configuration to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = true
}

jar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This configuration will enable the `bootJar` task (which generates the fat jar) and disable the `jar` task (which generates the plain jar).
