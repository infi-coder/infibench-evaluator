The error message you're seeing is due to a conflict between the Windows and Linux versions of Node.js and npm. The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is trying to run the Windows version of npm, but it's incompatible with the Linux environment.

The solution is to remove the Windows version from your PATH within WSL. You can do this by adding the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
export PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed -e 's/:\/mnt.*//g') # strip out problematic Windows %PATH% imported var
```

After adding this line, you need to source your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

or

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Then, you should be able to use the Linux version of npm without any issues. You can check the version of npm again by running:

```bash
npm -v
```

If you still see the same error, you may need to reinstall npm in your WSL environment. You can do this by running:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

This will install npm and should resolve any conflicts with the Windows version.
