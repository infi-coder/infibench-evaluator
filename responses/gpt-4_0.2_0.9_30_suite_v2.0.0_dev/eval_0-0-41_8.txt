The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method is asynchronous and it takes two callback functions as arguments. The first callback function is executed when the location is successfully retrieved, and the second callback function is executed when there is an error in retrieving the location.

In your case, you are only providing the success callback. If the user does not allow the location access, the error callback will be triggered. You need to provide this error callback to handle the case when the user does not allow location access.

Here is the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the geolocation is available and the user allows access, "Location accessed" will be logged. If the user does not allow access, "User not allowed" will be logged. If the geolocation is not available at all, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged.
