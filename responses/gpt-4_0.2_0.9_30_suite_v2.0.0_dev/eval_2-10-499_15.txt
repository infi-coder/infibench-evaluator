In Rust, you can't create an empty `TcpStream` directly. Instead, you can use `Option<TcpStream>` for the `conn` field. This way, you can set `conn` to `None` in the `new` method and `Some(stream)` in the `connect` method.

Here's how you can do it:

```rust
use std::net::TcpStream;

pub struct FistClient {
    addr: String,
    conn: Option<TcpStream>,
}

impl FistClient {
    pub fn new(ip: &str, port: &str) -> Self {
        FistClient {
            addr: String::from(ip) + ":" + &String::from(port),
            conn: None,
        }
    }

    pub fn connect(&mut self) {
        let res = TcpStream::connect(&self.addr);
        match res {
            Ok(c) => self.conn = Some(c),
            Err(_) => panic!(),
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, `conn` is an `Option<TcpStream>`, which means it can either contain a `TcpStream` (wrapped in `Some`) or it can be `None`. This is a common pattern in Rust for handling values that might not be available yet. When you call `connect`, you replace `None` with `Some(stream)`, effectively initializing the `conn` field.
