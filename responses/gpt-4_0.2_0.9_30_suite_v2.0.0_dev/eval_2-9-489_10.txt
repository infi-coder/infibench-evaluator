The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. Without these security features, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To resolve this issue, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Elasticsearch configuration file (`elasticsearch.yml`). This file is usually located in the `config` directory of your Elasticsearch installation.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

    ```yaml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

Please note that enabling security will require you to set up users and roles, and to authenticate to Elasticsearch. You can follow the [minimal setup guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html) provided in the warning message for more details.

If you don't want to enable security, you can suppress the warning by adding the following line to your `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: false
```

Again, save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

Please remember that disabling security is not recommended for production environments.
