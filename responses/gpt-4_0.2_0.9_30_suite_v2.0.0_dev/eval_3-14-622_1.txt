To conform to `ShapeStyle`, you need to create a struct that conforms to the `ShapeStyle` protocol and implement the `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType)` method. 

Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        shape.fill = Color.red
    }
}
```

However, `_ShapeStyle_ShapeType` and `_apply(to:)` are underscored because they are private to SwiftUI's implementation and not intended for direct use. 

Instead, you should use `View` modifiers and SwiftUI's built-in `ShapeStyle` conforming types like `Color` for filling shapes. 

If you want to create a custom `ShapeStyle`, you can do so by creating a struct that conforms to `ShapeStyle` and implements the `makeView(geometry: ShapeRenderingGeometry) -> some View` method:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func makeView(geometry: ShapeRenderingGeometry) -> some View {
        Color.red
    }
}
```

But this will also not work because `makeView(geometry:)` is not a part of the `ShapeStyle` protocol. 

In conclusion, SwiftUI does not currently support creating custom `ShapeStyle` conforming types. You should use the built-in types like `Color` and `Gradient` instead.
