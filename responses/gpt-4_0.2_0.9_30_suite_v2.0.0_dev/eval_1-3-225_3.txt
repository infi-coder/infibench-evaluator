Sure, here is your revised code:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        pig_latin_word = word[1:] + word[0] + 'ay'
        pig_latin_words.append(pig_latin_word)
    return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)
```

This function splits the input text into words, then for each word, it creates a new word by moving the first character to the end and appending "ay". The new words are then joined together with spaces in between to form the final pig Latin text.
