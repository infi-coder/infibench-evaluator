The error message you're seeing is due to a conflict between the Node.js and npm versions installed on your Windows system and those installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu environment. 

When you run `node -v` or `npm -v`, the system is trying to execute the Windows version of these commands from within the WSL2 environment, which is causing the error.

To resolve this issue, you need to remove the Windows PATH from the WSL environment. You can do this by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
export PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed -e 's/:\/mnt.*//g') # strip out problematic Windows %PATH% imported var
```

After adding this line, save the file and run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes. 

Now, when you run `node -v` or `npm -v`, the system should correctly use the versions installed in your WSL2 environment.

If you still face the issue, you may need to reinstall Node.js and npm in your WSL2 environment. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, uninstall the existing Node.js and npm:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get purge nodejs npm
    ```

2. Then, install Node.js and npm again:

    ```bash
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
    ```

This will install Node.js v14.x, which is the latest LTS version at the time of writing. You can replace `14` with any version you prefer. After the installation, you should be able to use `node -v` and `npm -v` without any issues.
