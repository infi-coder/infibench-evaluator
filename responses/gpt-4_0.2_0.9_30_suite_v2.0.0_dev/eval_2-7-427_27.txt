For the CSRF token mismatch issue, it could be due to a number of reasons:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the public directory of your Laravel application. This is because Laravel stores the CSRF token in the session, and if the session is not accessible due to incorrect domain configuration, it could lead to a CSRF token mismatch.

2. **Cookie Configuration**: Check your cookie settings in your Laravel configuration. If your application is under a subdomain, you might need to set the `SESSION_DOMAIN` in your `.env` file to your root domain (e.g., `.yourdomain.com`) to ensure cookies are accessible across all subdomains.

3. **HTTPS Configuration**: If your application is served over HTTPS, ensure that your `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE` is set to `true` in your `.env` file. This is to ensure that the session cookie is only sent over secure HTTPS connections.

4. **Session Driver**: If you're using a different session driver in production (like `memcached` or `redis`), ensure that it's correctly configured and working as expected.

For the email sending issue, the error message suggests that there's a problem with the SSL configuration. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Change MAIL_ENCRYPTION**: Try changing `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` from `ssl` to `tls` in your `.env` file. Some SMTP servers use `tls` instead of `ssl`.

2. **Change MAIL_PORT**: The port `587` is typically used with `tls`. If you're using `ssl`, the port should typically be `465`. So, try changing `MAIL_PORT` to `465` in your `.env` file.

3. **Check with your Email Provider**: The SMTP settings (host, port, encryption) can vary depending on the email provider. So, it's always a good idea to check with them if you're unsure about the settings.

Remember to clear your config cache (`php artisan config:cache`) after making changes to your `.env` file.
