Assuming the data you want to split is separated by spaces, you can use the `Split` function in VBA. This function splits a string into a one-dimensional array based on a delimiter.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, " ") ' assuming the delimiter is a space
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0) ' first piece of data
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1) ' second piece of data
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2) ' third piece of data
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3) ' fourth piece of data
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4) ' fifth piece of data
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code will split the line into five parts and put each part into its own cell in the same row. If your data is separated by a different character, replace the space in the `Split` function with that character.
