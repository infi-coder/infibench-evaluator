The issue you're facing might be due to the change in the default URL for Swagger UI. In the latest versions of Springdoc OpenAPI UI, the Swagger UI is not available at `/swagger-ui.html` anymore. Instead, it is available at `/swagger-ui/index.html`.

So, try accessing Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.

If you want to customize the Swagger UI path, you can do so by adding the following property to your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui.html
```

This will make Swagger UI available at the old default location (`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`).

Also, make sure that you have the correct Springdoc OpenAPI UI version that is compatible with your Spring Boot version. The version you're using (1.6.11) might not be compatible with Spring Boot v3 as it doesn't exist at the time of writing this. You might want to check the latest version from the [Springdoc OpenAPI UI Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springdoc/springdoc-openapi-ui).
