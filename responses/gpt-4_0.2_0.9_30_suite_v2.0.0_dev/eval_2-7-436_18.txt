The error message you're seeing is indicating that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are the steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal. If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires certain PHP extensions. You can check your installed extensions by running `php -m` in your terminal. Laravel 9 requires the following extensions:

    - BCMath PHP Extension
    - Ctype PHP Extension
    - Fileinfo PHP extension
    - JSON PHP Extension
    - Mbstring PHP Extension
    - OpenSSL PHP Extension
    - PDO PHP Extension
    - Tokenizer PHP Extension
    - XML PHP Extension

    If any of these extensions are missing, you need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Although you've updated Composer to 2.3.10, it's worth double-checking the version by running `composer --version` in your terminal. If for some reason the version is not 2.3.10, you need to update it.

4. **Clear Composer cache**: Sometimes, Composer cache can cause issues. You can clear the cache by running `composer clear-cache` in your terminal.

After ensuring all these requirements are met, try running the `composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.*"` command again. If you're still facing issues, please provide more details about your environment (like the exact PHP version, installed PHP extensions, and Composer version) for further assistance.
