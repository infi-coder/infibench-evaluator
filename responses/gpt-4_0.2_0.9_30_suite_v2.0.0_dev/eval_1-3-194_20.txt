You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write to an Excel file. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

    # Create a workbook and select the active worksheet
    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active

    # Write the data to the worksheet
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        ws.append(new_list[i])

    # Save the workbook
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

In this function, we first create a new workbook and select the active worksheet. Then, we iterate over the list of lists and append each list to the worksheet. Finally, we save the workbook to a file named "data.xlsx".
