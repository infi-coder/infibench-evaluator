The error you're getting is because the `sort()` function in R doesn't work directly on lists. However, you can use the `unlist()` function to convert the list to a vector, sort the vector, and then convert it back to a list if needed.

Here is the function `mySort` you asked for:

```r
mySort <- function(l) {
  # Convert list to vector
  vector_data <- unlist(l)
  
  # Sort vector
  sorted_vector <- sort(vector_data)
  
  # Convert sorted vector back to list
  sorted_list <- as.list(sorted_vector)
  
  return(sorted_list)
}
```

You can use this function to sort your list as follows:

```r
sorted_list_text_data <- mySort(list_text_data)
```

This will return your list sorted alphabetically.
