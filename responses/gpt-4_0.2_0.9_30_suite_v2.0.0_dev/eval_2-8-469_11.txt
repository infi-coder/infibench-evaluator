The error message is indicating that the `go_package` option is missing in your `.proto` file. This option is used to specify the package name for the generated Go code. 

You can fix the error by adding the `go_package` option to your `.proto` file like this:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "main";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

In this case, the `go_package` option is set to "main". You should replace "main" with the actual package name you want to use.

After making this change, you should be able to generate the Go code using the `protoc` command you provided.
