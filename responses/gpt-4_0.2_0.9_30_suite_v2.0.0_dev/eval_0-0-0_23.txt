Sure, here is a simple function that does exactly that:

```javascript
function keys_and_prices(raw_obj) {
    let keys = Object.keys(raw_obj);
    let prices = keys.map(key => raw_obj[key].price);
    return [keys, prices];
}
```

This function first gets all the keys of the object using `Object.keys()`. Then it maps over these keys and for each key, it gets the corresponding price from the original object. Finally, it returns an array containing the keys and prices arrays.

Here is how you can use it:

```javascript
var itemsToBuy = { milk: { quantity : 5, price: 20 }, bread: { quantity : 2, price: 15 }, potato: { quantity : 3, price: 10 } }
let ret = keys_and_prices(itemsToBuy)
console.log(ret[0]) // ["milk", "bread", "potato"]
console.log(ret[1]) // [20, 15, 10]
```

Please note that the order of keys and prices in the returned arrays depends on the order of properties in the original object, which is not guaranteed in JavaScript. If you need a specific order, you should sort the keys array before mapping it to prices.
