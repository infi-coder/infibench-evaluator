Sure, here is the revised version of your function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    result = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:] + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
        result.append(endString)
    return ' '.join(result)
```

In your original code, you were returning the result inside the loop, which means the function would stop after processing the first word. Instead, you should append each transformed word to a list, and then join them into a single string at the end.
