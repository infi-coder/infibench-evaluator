The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vite's dev server is binding to `localhost` by default, which in the context of a Docker container, means it's only accessible from within the container itself.

To make the Vite server accessible from outside the Docker container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`. You can do this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, which should make it accessible from outside the Docker container. After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server at `localhost:8080` from your host machine.
