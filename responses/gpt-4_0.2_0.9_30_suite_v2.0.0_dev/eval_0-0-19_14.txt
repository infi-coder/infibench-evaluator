The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` indicates that npm is unable to find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry.

However, it seems like you might have made a typo in the package name. The correct package name for the AWS SDK for JavaScript is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`.

Try running the command with the correct package name:

```bash
npm install --verbose aws-sdk
```

This should install the AWS SDK for JavaScript without any issues.
