In Tailwind CSS, you don't directly select elements like you would in traditional CSS. Instead, you apply utility classes directly to the elements you want to style. 

So, if you want to style the direct children of a div with class "section", you would need to apply the classes directly to those child divs in your HTML.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white"> <!-- Apply your styles here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white"> <!-- Apply your styles here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-blue-500` applies a blue background and `text-white` applies white text color to the divs. Replace these with whatever Tailwind CSS utility classes you need.

Remember, Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means you generally apply styles directly to the elements you want to style, rather than writing traditional CSS selectors.
