The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` is generated by the `bootJar` task in Spring Boot 2.5.0. This is a new feature introduced in Spring Boot 2.5.0 to allow you to have a jar without the layers.idx file.

If you want to disable the generation of the `*-plain.jar` file, you can configure the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file like this:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will prevent Gradle from running the `bootJar` task and generating the `*-plain.jar` file.
