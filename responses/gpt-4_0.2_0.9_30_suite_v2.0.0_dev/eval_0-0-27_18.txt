Your code seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you can check if your `useQuery` hook is stuck in the loading state:

1. **Network Issues:** Make sure your device/emulator is connected to the internet and can access the GraphQL server. You can check this by opening the URL 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' in a web browser on your device/emulator.

2. **Server Issues:** The server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' might be down or not responding. You can check the server status by running a query directly on the server using a tool like GraphQL Playground or Apollo Studio.

3. **CORS Issues:** If you're running this on a physical device, you might be running into CORS issues. React Native doesn't have the same origin policy as a web browser, but the server might be configured to only allow certain origins. You can check this by looking at the network requests in the debug console or using a tool like Charles Proxy.

4. **Apollo Client Configuration:** Make sure the Apollo Client is correctly configured. The `uri` and `cache` properties are required, but there might be other properties needed depending on your server configuration.

5. **Query Issues:** The query might be incorrect or the server might not support it. You can check this by running the query directly on the server using a tool like GraphQL Playground or Apollo Studio.

6. **React Native Version:** There might be compatibility issues with the version of React Native you're using. You're using version 0.68.1, which is not a valid React Native version. The latest version at the time of writing is 0.67.2. Please check your React Native version.

If none of these suggestions work, you might want to consider opening an issue on the Apollo Client GitHub repository.
