Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. You need to declare your variables `query` and `currentSheet`.
2. You are trying to use `query.Name` but `query` is just a string, not an object with a `Name` property.
3. You are not using `currentSheet` anywhere in your code.

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Get the query from the cell
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Get the current sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Add the query to the current sheet
    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code will get the query from cell A1 in Sheet6, and then run that query, placing the results in Sheet "target" starting at cell A1. Please replace "target" with the actual name of your target sheet.
