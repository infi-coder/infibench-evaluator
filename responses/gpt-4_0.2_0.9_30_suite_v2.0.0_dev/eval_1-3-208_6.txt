Sure, I can help with that. The issue with your code is that it checks if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, not if each individual character of the input string is in the `correct` string. 

Here's how you can modify your code to create the `checkString` function:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)
```

This function uses the `all` function to check if all characters in `text` are in the `correct` string. If they are, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

You can use this function like this:

```python
text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

In this code, the `checkString` function is called with the input string. If the function returns `True`, "Success" is printed; otherwise, "Failure" is printed.
