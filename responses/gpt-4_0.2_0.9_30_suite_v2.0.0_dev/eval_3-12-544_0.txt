The error you're seeing is due to the fact that you're trying to use Flutter's plugin services before `runApp()` has been called. The `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` function is a plugin service and it requires a binding with the Flutter engine to work properly. This binding is not available until `runApp()` is called.

To fix this, you can use the `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` function before calling any plugin services. This function ensures that the Flutter engine is properly initialized before you try to use any plugin services.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This should resolve the error you're seeing.
