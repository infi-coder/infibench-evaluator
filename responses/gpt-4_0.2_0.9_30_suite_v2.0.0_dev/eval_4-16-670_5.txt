Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a traditional RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` tool. Here's how:

1. Convert OpenSSH private key to RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for the passphrase (if any). After entering the passphrase, the key will be re-written in place in the RSA format. The `-p` option tells `ssh-keygen` to change the passphrase of a private key file, the `-m PEM` option specifies the output format and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file to convert.

2. You don't need to convert the public key. The public key format is standard and doesn't need to be converted when you convert the private key. The public key file (`id_rsa.pub`) can be used as is.

Please note that this operation will overwrite your existing OpenSSH private key. If you want to keep the original key, make sure to create a backup before running this command.
