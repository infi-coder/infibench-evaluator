In Font Awesome 5, the font family has been split into different styles. So, you need to specify the correct font family for the icon you want to use. 

For example, if you are using a solid style icon, the font family would be "Font Awesome 5 Free". If you are using a brand icon, the font family would be "Font Awesome 5 Brands".

Also, you need to add `font-weight` because Font Awesome 5 uses different font weights for different styles. For solid icons, the font weight is 900.

Here is how you can modify your code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* Change this to the correct font family */
  font-weight: 900; /* Add this line */
}
```

Please replace `"Font Awesome 5 Free"` with the correct font family based on the style of the icon you are using. If you are using a brand icon, replace it with `"Font Awesome 5 Brands"`.
