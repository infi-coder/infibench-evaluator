The issue is with the single quotes around `$searchT` in your `grep` command. In bash, single quotes preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes. This means that `$searchT` is not being interpreted as a variable, but as a literal string. 

You should use double quotes instead, which will allow for variable substitution. Here is the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

Also, note that I moved `wc -l` to be part of the first `grep` command. This is because `wc -l` counts the number of lines, and you want it to count the number of matching lines, not the total number of lines in the file.
