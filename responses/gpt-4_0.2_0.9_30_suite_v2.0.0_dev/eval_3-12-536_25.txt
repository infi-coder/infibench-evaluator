You can use `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton`, and `TextButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property. 

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with `border-radius` in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {},
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20), // change this value as per your requirement
    ),
  ),
  child: Text('Click Me'),
)
```

In the above code, `ElevatedButton.styleFrom` is used to style the button. The `shape` property is used to define the shape of the button. `RoundedRectangleBorder` is used to make the button's corners rounded. The `borderRadius` property is used to define the radius of the corners. You can change the value of `borderRadius` as per your requirement.
