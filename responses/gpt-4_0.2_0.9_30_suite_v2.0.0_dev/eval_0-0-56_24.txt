The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vite's server is binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) inside the Docker container by default. This means it's not accessible from outside the container, even though the port is exposed.

To fix this, you need to configure Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0` so it's accessible from any IP address. You can do this by modifying the `server` configuration in your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

Now, when you run your Docker container and start the Vite server, it should be accessible from your host machine at `localhost:8080`.
