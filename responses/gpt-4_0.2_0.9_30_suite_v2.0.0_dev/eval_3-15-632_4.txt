If you want to split a line into multiple columns, you can use the `Split` function in VBA. This function splits a string into a one-dimensional array, based on a delimiter you specify.

Assuming your data is separated by spaces, you can modify your code as follows:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, " ") ' split the line by spaces
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0) ' first part
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1) ' second part
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2) ' third part
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3) ' fourth part
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4) ' fifth part
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

Please note that this code assumes that there are always five parts in the line. If the number of parts can vary, you should add error checking to prevent out-of-bounds errors.
