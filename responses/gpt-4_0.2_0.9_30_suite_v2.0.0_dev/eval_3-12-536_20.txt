You can use `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton`, and `TextButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property.

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with border-radius in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20), // radius of 20
    ),
  ),
  onPressed: () {
    print('Button pressed!');
  },
  child: Text('Button'),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton.styleFrom` is used to create a button with a custom shape. The `shape` property is set to a `RoundedRectangleBorder` with a `borderRadius` of 20, which makes the button rounded. The `onPressed` function is called when the button is pressed, and the `child` property is used to set the button's label.
