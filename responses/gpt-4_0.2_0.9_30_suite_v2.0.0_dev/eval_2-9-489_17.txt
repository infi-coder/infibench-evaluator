The warning you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. This means that without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable these security features. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Elasticsearch configuration file (`elasticsearch.yml`). The location of this file can vary depending on how you installed Elasticsearch, but it's often located in `/etc/elasticsearch`, `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch`, or `/usr/local/opt/elasticsearch/config` on a Mac.

2. Add the following lines to the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save and close the file.

4. Restart Elasticsearch. If you're using Homebrew, you can do this by running `brew services restart elasticsearch`.

After doing this, Elasticsearch's built-in security features should be enabled, and you should no longer see the warning.

Please note that enabling these security features will require you to set up user authentication for Elasticsearch. You can do this by following the instructions in the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-minimal-setup.html).

If you don't want to enable these security features, you can suppress the warning by adding the following line to your `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: false
```

This will tell Elasticsearch that you intentionally want to run it without the built-in security features. However, please be aware that this could potentially leave your Elasticsearch cluster vulnerable to unauthorized access.
