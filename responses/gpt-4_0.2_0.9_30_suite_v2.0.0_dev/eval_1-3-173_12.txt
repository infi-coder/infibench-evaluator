Sure, you can create a function that checks if the year is a leap year or not. If it is a leap year, it returns 366, otherwise it returns 365. Here is a simple function that does this:

```python
def DaysInYear(year):
    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
        return 366
    else:
        return 365
```

This function works by checking if the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or if it is divisible by 400. These are the rules for determining if a year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar. If the year meets these conditions, it is a leap year and the function returns 366. Otherwise, it is not a leap year and the function returns 365.
