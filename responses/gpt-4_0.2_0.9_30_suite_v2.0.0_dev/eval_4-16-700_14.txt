You can optimize your task by using `awk` command in bash. `awk` is a powerful text processing command. It is faster and more suitable for such tasks.

Here is an optimized version of your task:

```bash
awk -F'=' '/^name/ {name=$2} /^value/ {print name"="$2}' input.txt > output.txt
```

This `awk` command works as follows:

- `-F'='` sets the field separator to `=`.
- `/^name/ {name=$2}` stores the value of `name` when the line starts with `name`.
- `/^value/ {print name"="$2}` prints the `name` and `value` when the line starts with `value`.
- `input.txt > output.txt` reads from `input.txt` and writes to `output.txt`.

This command will run much faster than your original script.
