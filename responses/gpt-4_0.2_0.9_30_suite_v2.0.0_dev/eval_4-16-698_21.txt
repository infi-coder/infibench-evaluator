You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how to do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, those changes will be applied to your current terminal session.

If you're using a different shell like `zsh` (which is the default shell in macOS Catalina and later), you would use the corresponding configuration file. For `zsh`, the file is `.zshrc`:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

This way, you don't need to restart your terminal session to see the changes.
