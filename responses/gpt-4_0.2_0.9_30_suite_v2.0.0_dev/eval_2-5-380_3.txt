The issue you're facing might be due to the change in the default URL for Swagger UI. In the newer versions of springdoc-openapi-ui, the Swagger UI is not available at `/swagger-ui.html` anymore. Instead, it is available at `/swagger-ui/index.html`.

So, try accessing Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html` or `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/`.

If you still face issues, make sure you have the following:

1. `@EnableOpenApi` annotation in your Spring Boot application class.

```java
import org.springdoc.core.EnableOpenApi;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableOpenApi
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}
```

2. Check if there's any path or URL configuration for Swagger UI in your application properties or YAML file. If there's any, make sure it's correct.

3. Make sure your controllers are annotated with `@RestController` and your APIs are annotated with `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc. Swagger uses these annotations to generate the API documentation.

4. If you're using Spring Security, make sure the Swagger UI URL is permitted for access.

If you've checked all these and still facing issues, please provide more details about your setup.
