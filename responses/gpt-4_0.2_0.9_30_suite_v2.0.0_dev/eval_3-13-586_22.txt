The error you're encountering is due to changes in Android 12 (API level 31) regarding `PendingIntent` mutability. Starting from this version, you need to explicitly specify whether a `PendingIntent` is mutable or immutable when you create it.

The error message suggests that the `MediaSessionCompat` class in the AndroidX Media library is creating a `PendingIntent` without specifying its mutability, which is not allowed in Android 12 and above.

This issue should be fixed in the AndroidX Media library version 1.4.3. So, you should update your dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
implementation 'androidx.media:media:1.4.3'
```

After updating the library, clean and rebuild your project. If the problem persists, you may need to check other parts of your code where you're creating `PendingIntent`s and ensure you're specifying their mutability.

Here's how you can create a `PendingIntent` with the `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` flag:

```kotlin
val intent = Intent(this, YourReceiver::class.java)
val pendingIntent: PendingIntent = if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
    PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE or PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT)
} else {
    PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT)
}
```

In this example, `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` is used for Android 12 and above, and for earlier versions, the `PendingIntent` is created without specifying mutability.
