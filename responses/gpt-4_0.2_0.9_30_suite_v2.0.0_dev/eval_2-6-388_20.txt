The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`. It's actually part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

This attribute is used to specify that an entity will not have a key defined and therefore will not be able to participate in add, update or delete operations. It's typically used for read-only entities which are mapped to database views or queries.

To use it, you need to add a reference to the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. Here's how you can do it:

```c#
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

After adding this namespace, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class like this:

```c#
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    // Your properties here
}
```

And then in your `DbContext`:

```c#
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

Remember to install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` NuGet package if it's not already installed in your project. You can do this via the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio, or by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```shell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
```
