In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, it will actually make the column names unique by adding a suffix to the duplicate column names. In your case, the column names of `d3` will be `a` and `a.1`.

So, you can select the second column by its unique name `a.1`:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

If you want to select the second column by its index, you can do:

```r
second_col <- d3[,2]
```

This will select the second column regardless of its name.
