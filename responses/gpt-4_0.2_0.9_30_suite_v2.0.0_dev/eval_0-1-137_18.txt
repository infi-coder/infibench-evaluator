The error message indicates that the `$theme-colors` map is not a valid CSS value. This is because you're trying to redefine the `$theme-colors` map after it has already been defined in the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file which you imported at the beginning.

To fix this, you should define your `$theme-colors` map before importing the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file. Also, you should use the `!default` flag to ensure that your map is used only if `$theme-colors` has not been defined before.

Here is the revised code:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color, // replace #your-color with your desired color
) !default;

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Please replace `#your-color` with the color you want to use for the primary theme color.

Also, note that if you want to change multiple theme colors, you can do so by adding more entries to the `$theme-colors` map. For example:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-primary-color, // replace with your desired color
  "secondary": #your-secondary-color, // replace with your desired color
  // add more theme colors as needed
) !default;

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Remember to replace `#your-primary-color`, `#your-secondary-color`, etc. with the actual colors you want to use.
