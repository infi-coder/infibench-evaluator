Sure, here is the revised function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    result = []
    for word in words:
        endString = str(word[1:]) + str(word[0]).lower() + 'ay'
        result.append(endString)
    return ' '.join(result)
```

This function works by splitting the input text into words, then for each word, it moves the first character to the end and appends "ay". The results are collected into a list, which is then joined into a single string with spaces in between the words.
