The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It's part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace.

The `[Keyless]` attribute is used to denote that an entity does not contain a key and therefore cannot be saved to the database using Entity Framework Core. It is typically used for views or tables that are read-only.

To use the `[Keyless]` attribute, you need to add a reference to the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

Here is an example of how to use it:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    // other properties...
}
```

And in your `DbContext`:

```csharp
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

You can then use the `FromSqlRaw` method as you mentioned:

```csharp
_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)
```

Make sure you have installed the correct Entity Framework Core package. You can install it via NuGet Package Manager with the following command:

```shell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
```

Or via .NET CLI:

```shell
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
```
