The `f` before the string in the `print` function is used to denote a **f-string** (formatted string literal) in Python. It was introduced in Python 3.6.

F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting. The expressions will be replaced by their values when the string is evaluated. The expressions to be evaluated are written in curly braces `{}`.

In your example:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

`{args.input_directory}` and `{args.output_directory}` are expressions embedded in the f-string. When the string is evaluated, these expressions are replaced by the values of `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` respectively.

So, if `args.input_directory` is `/home/user/input` and `args.output_directory` is `/home/user/output`, the printed output will be:

```
Input directory: /home/user/input
Output directory: /home/user/output
```
