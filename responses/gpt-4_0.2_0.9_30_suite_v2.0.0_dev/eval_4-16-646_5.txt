The error message `bad CPU type in executable` typically means that the executable file was compiled for a different architecture than the one you're currently using. In your case, it seems that the version of `pdftk` you have installed is not compatible with macOS Catalina.

macOS Catalina only supports 64-bit applications, and it's likely that the version of `pdftk` you're trying to run is a 32-bit application. 

Here are the steps to solve this issue:

1. Uninstall the current version of `pdftk` you have installed.

2. Install Homebrew if you haven't already. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

3. Install `pdftk-java` which is a reimplementation of `pdftk` in Java. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
brew install pdftk-java
```

4. Create a symbolic link to `pdftk-java` in `/usr/local/bin` so you can use `pdftk` command directly:

```bash
ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/pdftk-java/3.2.1/bin/pdftk /usr/local/bin/pdftk
```

Please replace `3.2.1` with the version of `pdftk-java` you have installed.

Now, you should be able to use `pdftk` command in your terminal without any issues.
