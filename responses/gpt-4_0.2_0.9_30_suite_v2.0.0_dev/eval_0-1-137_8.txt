The error message is indicating that the `$theme-colors` map is not a valid CSS value. This is because you are trying to overwrite the `$theme-colors` map after it has already been used in the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file.

To change the Bootstrap's default theme-colors with SASS, you should define your `$theme-colors` map before importing the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file. Also, you should import the `_functions.scss` file before defining your `$theme-colors` map because the `_variables.scss` file uses functions defined in the `_functions.scss` file.

Here is the revised code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color, // replace #your-color with your color
  "secondary": #6c757d,
  "success": #198754,
  "info": #0dcaf0,
  "warning": #ffc107,
  "danger": #dc3545,
  "light": #f8f9fa,
  "dark": #212529
);
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Please replace `#your-color` with the color you want to use for the primary color. If you want to change other colors, you can replace them in the same way.

After saving your changes, you can compile your SCSS file again. The error should be gone and your new theme colors should be applied.
