To conform to `ShapeStyle` in SwiftUI, you need to create a struct that conforms to `ShapeStyle` protocol and implement the `makeBody` method. Here is how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {}
    func _makeView(geometry: _GraphValue<_ShapeStyle_ShapeType>, inputs: _ViewInputs) -> _ViewOutputs {
        return Color.red._makeView(geometry: geometry, inputs: inputs)
    }
}
```

In this code, `RedShapeStyle` is a struct that conforms to `ShapeStyle`. The `_makeView` method is used to return the actual view that will be used as the fill for the shape. In this case, it's `Color.red`.
