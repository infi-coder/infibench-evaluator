The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` file is generated by the `bootJar` task in Spring Boot 2.5.0. If you want to disable the generation of the `*-plain.jar` file, you can configure the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file to disable the `enabled` property of the `bootJar` task.

Here is how you can do it:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

Add this to your `build.gradle` file. After this change, the `*-plain.jar` file will not be generated.
