Your code seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you can check if the data loading hangs:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. Sometimes, the network might be the issue.

2. **Server Status**: Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can do this by simply pasting the URL into your browser and checking if it returns a response.

3. **CORS Policy**: If you're running this on a local device, there might be CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues. The server at the provided URL needs to allow requests from the origin your app is running on.

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading or upgrading the version.

5. **GraphQL Query**: Ensure that your GraphQL query is correct and the server supports it. You can test the query using a GraphQL client like GraphiQL or Apollo Studio.

6. **Error Handling**: It's possible that an error is occurring but not being logged. Try logging the error in a more detailed way:

    ```javascript
    if (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
        return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
    }
    ```

7. **React Native Debugger**: Use React Native Debugger to inspect the network request and check if the request is being made and what response is being received.

8. **React Native Version**: You're using a version of React Native (`0.68.1`) that doesn't exist. The latest version at the time of writing is `0.67.0`. Please check your version.

If none of these work, please provide more details about the issue.
