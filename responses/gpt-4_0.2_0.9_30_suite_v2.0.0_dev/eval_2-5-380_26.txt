The issue you're facing might be due to the change in the Swagger UI URL in the newer versions of the Springdoc OpenAPI UI library.

In the newer versions, the Swagger UI is not available at `/swagger-ui.html` anymore. Instead, it's available at `/swagger-ui/index.html` or `/swagger-ui/`.

So, try accessing the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/` or `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.

If you still face issues, make sure that the Springdoc OpenAPI UI library is correctly configured in your Spring Boot application. You might need to add the `@OpenAPIDefinition` or `@SpringBootApplication` annotations to your main class, if they're not already present.

Here is an example:

```java
import org.springdoc.core.SpringDocUtils;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

Also, ensure that you have the correct Spring Boot version. The Springdoc OpenAPI UI library version you're using (1.6.11) requires Spring Boot 2.1.0 or later.
