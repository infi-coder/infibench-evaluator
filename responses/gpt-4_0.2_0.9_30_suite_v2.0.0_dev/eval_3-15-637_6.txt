The error you're experiencing might be due to several reasons. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Check SeleniumBasic and Browser Driver Compatibility**: Ensure that the SeleniumBasic version you're using is compatible with the browser driver (ChromeDriver, IEDriver, etc.). If not, you might need to download the appropriate version of the browser driver.

2. **Check Excel Version Compatibility**: SeleniumBasic might not be fully compatible with Excel 2019. You could try downgrading your Excel version or look for an updated SeleniumBasic version that supports Excel 2019.

3. **Check References in VBA**: Go to VBA Editor > Tools > References and make sure that Selenium Type Library is checked. If it's missing, you might need to browse and add it manually.

4. **Reinstall SeleniumBasic**: Uninstall SeleniumBasic, restart your machine, and then reinstall SeleniumBasic.

5. **Update Your Code**: The way you're initializing the WebDriver and keys might be causing issues. Try the following code:

```vba
Dim driver As WebDriver
Set driver = New WebDriver
driver.Start "ie"
driver.Get "https://www.google.com/"
```

Remember to replace `"ie"` with the appropriate browser driver you're using if it's not Internet Explorer.

6. **Check Internet Explorer Settings**: If you're using Internet Explorer, ensure that the "Enable Protected Mode" setting is the same for all zones in Internet Options > Security.
