The error message indicates that npm cannot find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry. This is because the package does not exist with that name. The correct package name for the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js is `aws-sdk`.

You should replace `aws-sdk-js` with `aws-sdk` in your `package.json` file or in the npm install command.

So, instead of running:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk-js
```

You should run:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

This should resolve the issue.
