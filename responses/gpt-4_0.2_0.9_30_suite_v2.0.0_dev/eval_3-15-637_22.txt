The error you're encountering might be due to a couple of reasons. Here are some suggestions to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Check SeleniumBasic and Browser Driver Version**: Ensure that you have the latest version of SeleniumBasic installed. Also, check if the browser driver (like ChromeDriver for Chrome) is compatible with the version of the browser you're using.

2. **Check References**: In VBA editor, go to `Tools -> References` and make sure that Selenium Type Library is checked. If it's not, scroll down the list to find it and check it.

3. **Check Excel Trust Center Settings**: Go to `File -> Options -> Trust Center -> Trust Center Settings -> Macro Settings`. Ensure that 'Trust access to the VBA project object model' is checked.

4. **Check Internet Explorer Version**: SeleniumBasic uses Internet Explorer Driver Server. If you're using IE 11, you might face issues as Microsoft has deprecated it. Try using Chrome or Firefox instead.

5. **Check Code**: Your code is trying to create an instance of Selenium.keys but it's not used anywhere. If you're not using it, you can remove it. Also, you've declared `IE As Object` but it's not used. 

Here's a simplified version of your code:

```vba
Dim driver As New WebDriver

driver.Start "chrome"
driver.Window.Maximize
driver.Get "https://www.google.com/"
```
