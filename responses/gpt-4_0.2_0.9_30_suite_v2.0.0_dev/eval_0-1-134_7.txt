It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow. 

For example, if you type `.classname` and press `Tab`, it will automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`. 

If it's not working for you, here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check if your text editor supports Emmet**: Emmet is built-in in many text editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc. If you're using an editor that doesn't support Emmet, you might need to install it manually.

2. **Check if Emmet is enabled**: If your editor supports Emmet but it's not working, it might be disabled. You can check this in your editor's settings.

3. **Check your syntax**: Make sure you're using the correct syntax. For example, `.classname` should expand to a `div` with a class of `classname`. If you're trying to create an element other than a `div`, you need to specify it, like `ul.classname` for a `ul` with a class of `classname`.

4. **Check your key binding**: In some editors, you might need to press a different key instead of `Tab` to expand Emmet abbreviations. Check your editor's documentation to see if this is the case.

If you've checked all of these and it's still not working, you might want to look for help specific to your text editor.
