In Nest.js, you can create an index in Mongoose schema by using the `@Index()` decorator from the `@nestjs/mongoose` package. 

Here is how you can do it:

```javascript
import { Prop, Schema, SchemaFactory, Index } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { Document } from 'mongoose';

@Schema()
@Index({ type: 1 }) // This is where you set the index
export class MySchema extends Document {

  @Prop()
  _id: string;

  @Prop({required: true})
  type: string;

  @Prop()
  creationDate: string;

  @Prop()
  name: string;
}

export const MySchemaModel = SchemaFactory.createForClass(MySchema);
```

In the above code, `@Index({ type: 1 })` creates an index on the `type` field.

Remember to import the `Index` decorator from `@nestjs/mongoose`.

Also, ensure that you have connected to your MongoDB instance correctly and have the necessary permissions to create an index. 

If you are still facing issues, you might want to check the logs for any errors or warnings related to index creation.
