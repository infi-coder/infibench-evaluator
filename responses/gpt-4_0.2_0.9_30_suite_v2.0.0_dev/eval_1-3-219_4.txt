This issue might be due to several reasons, such as a problem with the Python extension, a problem with the Jupyter server, or a problem with the Python interpreter. Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and potentially solve the problem:

1. **Check the Python Interpreter**: Make sure that the Python interpreter selected in VS Code is the one from your 'da38' environment. You can check this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left of the status bar in VS Code. If it's not the correct one, you can select it from the list.

2. **Check the Python Extension**: Make sure that the Python extension is properly installed and enabled. You can check this by going to the Extensions view in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X) and searching for the Python extension. If it's not installed, you can install it from there. If it's disabled, you can enable it.

3. **Check the Jupyter Server**: Try to start the Jupyter server manually from the command line to see if there's a problem with the server itself. You can do this by activating your 'da38' environment and running `jupyter notebook`. If there's a problem with the server, you should see an error message.

4. **Reinstall the Python Packages**: Try to reinstall the Python packages related to Jupyter in your 'da38' environment. You can do this by activating your 'da38' environment and running `conda install jupyter ipykernel`.

5. **Check the VS Code Settings**: Check the VS Code settings to see if there's a problem with the settings related to Jupyter or Python. You can do this by going to the Settings view in VS Code (Ctrl+,) and searching for 'Jupyter' or 'Python'. Make sure that the settings are correct.

6. **Check the Error Log**: Check the error log in VS Code to see if there's more information about the problem. You can do this by going to the Output view in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+U) and selecting 'Python' or 'Jupyter' from the dropdown menu.

If none of these steps solve the problem, you might want to consider submitting an issue on the VS Code GitHub page or the Python extension GitHub page.
