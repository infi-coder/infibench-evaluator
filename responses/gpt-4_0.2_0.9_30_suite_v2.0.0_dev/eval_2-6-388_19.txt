The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`. It is part of `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

To use it, you need to install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational` package and add the following using directive at the top of your file:

```c#
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Then you can use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class like this:

```c#
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    // other properties...
}
```

Remember that the `[Keyless]` attribute is used to specify that the entity type does not have any key, it is typically used for entities that map to views and tables that do not have a primary key.
