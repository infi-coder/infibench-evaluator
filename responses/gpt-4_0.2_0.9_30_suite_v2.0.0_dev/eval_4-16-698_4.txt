You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how you do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command reads and executes the file from the given path in the current shell environment. So, it will apply any changes you've made to your `.bash_profile`.

If you're using zsh (which is the default in macOS Catalina and later), you should do:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

This will apply the changes you've made to your `.zshrc` file.
