You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. The arrow is created using a CSS `background-image`, so you can override it with your own SVG image or use a Unicode character as an arrow.

Here's an example of how you can do it using a Unicode character:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    /* Unicode character for "down arrow" */
    content: "\25BC";
    color: green;
    /* Remove the default background-image */
    background-image: none;
}

.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    /* Unicode character for "right arrow" */
    content: "\25B6";
    color: green;
    /* Remove the default background-image */
    background-image: none;
}
```

This will change the arrow to a green color. The `:not(.collapsed)::after` selector targets the arrow when the accordion is open (showing the down arrow), and the `.collapsed::after` selector targets the arrow when the accordion is closed (showing the right arrow).

Please note that the Unicode characters used here are just examples. You can use any other characters that suit your needs.
