You need to specify the `go_package` option in your proto file. This option should be a full import path, which will be used if there are no more obvious ways to import it.

Here's how you can modify your proto file:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "github.com/yourusername/yourproject/yourpackage";

message Person {
    string name = 1;
    int32 age = 2;
}
```

Replace `"github.com/yourusername/yourproject/yourpackage"` with the actual path where you want the generated Go file to be placed.

After you've done this, you should be able to generate the Go code with the same command:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. simple.proto
```
