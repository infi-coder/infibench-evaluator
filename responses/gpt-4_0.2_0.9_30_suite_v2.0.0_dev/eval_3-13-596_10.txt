The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` file is generated due to the new feature in Spring Boot 2.5.0 that creates a "plain" jar alongside the usual fat jar. If you want to disable this feature, you can modify your `build.gradle` file to configure the `bootJar` task to disable the `enabled` property of the `plain` output.

Here is how you can do it:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

But, this will disable the entire `bootJar` task. If you want to disable only the generation of the `plain` jar, you can do it like this:

```groovy
bootJar {
    tasks.named('bootJar').configure {
        enabled = false
    }
}
```

This will disable only the `bootJar` task that generates the `plain` jar, and the usual fat jar will still be generated.
