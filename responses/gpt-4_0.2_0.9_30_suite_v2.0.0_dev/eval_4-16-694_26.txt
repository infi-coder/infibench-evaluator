You can use `awk` to extract the language code. Here's how you can modify your command:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | head -1 | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'
```

Here's what's happening in this command:

- `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'` : This will output only the matched string. The regular expression `lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"` matches the `lang` attribute and its value.
- `head -1` : This will output the first match.
- `awk -F'"' '{print $2}'` : This uses `awk` to split the string by the delimiter `"`, and then prints the second field, which is the language code.

This command should work regardless of whether the language code is in the format `en-US` or `he-IL`.
