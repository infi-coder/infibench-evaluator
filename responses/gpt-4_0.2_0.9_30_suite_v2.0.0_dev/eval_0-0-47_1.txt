Yes, you're on the right track. You just need to define the type for the objects in the array separately. Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
type Product = {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
};

bagTotal = (products: Product[]) => {
  // function does stuff
}
```

In this case, `Product` is a type that represents an object with `name`, `price`, and `description` properties. `Product[]` is an array of such objects. This way, you can ensure that the `products` parameter of your `bagTotal` function is an array of objects with the correct properties.
