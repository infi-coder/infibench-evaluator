Here is a Python solution using the `re` module to replace all occurrences of dashes and underscores with the next character in uppercase:

```python
import re

def to_camel_case(text):
    return re.sub(r'[_-](.)', lambda x: x.group(1).upper(), text)
```

This function works by using a regular expression to find all occurrences of a dash or underscore followed by any character (`[_-](.)`). The `re.sub` function then replaces each match with the result of the lambda function, which takes the matched string `x`, gets the character after the dash or underscore (`x.group(1)`), and converts it to uppercase.

Here's how it works on the test cases:

```python
print(to_camel_case(''))  # returns: ''
print(to_camel_case("the_stealth_warrior"))  # returns: 'theStealthWarrior'
print(to_camel_case("The-Stealth-Warrior"))  # returns: 'TheStealthWarrior'
print(to_camel_case("A-B-C"))  # returns: 'ABC'
```
