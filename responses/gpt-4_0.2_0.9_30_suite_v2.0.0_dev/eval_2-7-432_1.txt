The "419 Page Expired" error occurs because Laravel uses CSRF protection for all POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests. When you log out from one tab, Laravel invalidates the session and the CSRF token associated with it. So, when you try to log out from the second tab, the CSRF token is no longer valid, hence the "419 Page Expired" error.

To handle this, you can catch the `TokenMismatchException` in your `Handler.php` file and redirect the user to the login page. Here's how you can do it:

```php
// app/Exceptions/Handler.php

use Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException;

public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof TokenMismatchException) {
        // Redirect to a form. Here is an example of how we can
        // redirect to the login page if the user is logged out
        // during the session.
        return redirect()->route('login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

This way, if a user tries to log out from a session that has already been invalidated, they will be redirected to the login page instead of seeing the "419 Page Expired" error.
