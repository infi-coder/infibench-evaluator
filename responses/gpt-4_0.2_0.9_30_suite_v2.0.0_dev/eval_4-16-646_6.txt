This error is due to the fact that MacOS Catalina only supports 64-bit applications and `pdftk` is a 32-bit application. Therefore, you can't run `pdftk` directly on MacOS Catalina. However, you can use a workaround to solve this problem by using `pdftk-java` which is a port of `pdftk` to Java.

Here are the steps to install `pdftk-java`:

1. First, you need to install Homebrew if you haven't installed it yet. Open Terminal and paste the following command:

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

2. Now, install `pdftk-java` using Homebrew by running:

    ```bash
    brew install pdftk-java
    ```

3. Since `pdftk-java` is not a drop-in replacement for `pdftk`, you need to create a symlink to use it as `pdftk`. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    echo 'alias pdftk="/usr/local/bin/pdftk-java"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

4. Now, you need to reload your shell configuration. Run:

    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

5. You can now use `pdftk` command as usual.

Please note that `pdftk-java` might not support all the features of the original `pdftk`. If you need full `pdftk` functionality, you might need to consider using a virtual machine or Docker.
