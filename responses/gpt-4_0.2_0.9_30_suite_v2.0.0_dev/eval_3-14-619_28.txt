Your code seems fine, but the issue might be that you're trying to test the `@Binding` behavior in the SwiftUI preview. The SwiftUI preview doesn't always reflect state changes correctly.

Try running your code in a simulator or on a real device. If you want to test it in the preview, you need to wrap your `ContentView` in another view that owns the `@State`.

Here's an example:

```swift
struct TestView: View {
    @State private var selected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $selected)
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        TestView()
    }
}
```

In this example, `TestView` owns the `@State` and `ContentView` receives it as a `@Binding`. This should reflect changes in the SwiftUI preview.
