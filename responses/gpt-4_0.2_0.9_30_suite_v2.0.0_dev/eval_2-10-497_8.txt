In Rust, the `Box<T>` type is a smart pointer that points to data on the heap. It's important to note that a `Box<T>` cannot be null. If you want to have a nullable pointer, you should use the `Option<Box<T>>` type. 

Here's how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

In this case, `None` represents a null pointer, and `Some(box)` represents a non-null pointer. You can check if a `Box<T>` is null by checking if the `Option<Box<T>>` is `None`.

Here's how you can check if `top` is null:

```rust
if let Some(_) = stack.top {
    println!("top is not null");
} else {
    println!("top is null");
}
```

Or you can use the `is_none()` or `is_some()` methods:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    println!("top is null");
} else {
    println!("top is not null");
}
```
