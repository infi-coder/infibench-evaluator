It seems like you're facing a version conflict issue. Hibernate Validator 5.x does not support `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` for `String` types. These constraints are supported from Hibernate Validator 6.x onwards.

Spring Boot 2.0.4.RELEASE, which you're using, comes with Hibernate Validator 6.0.11.Final. However, your JBoss server is using Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2, which does not support these constraints for `String` types.

To resolve this issue, you have two options:

1. **Upgrade your JBoss server to a version that supports Hibernate Validator 6.x.** This is the recommended solution if you have control over the JBoss server and can upgrade it.

2. **Downgrade your Spring Boot version to one that uses Hibernate Validator 5.x.** This is not recommended because you would lose out on the features and improvements in the newer versions of Spring Boot and Hibernate Validator.

Here's how you can exclude the Hibernate Validator brought by Spring Boot and use the one provided by JBoss:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

Remember to add this exclusion to all dependencies that might transitively bring in Hibernate Validator.
