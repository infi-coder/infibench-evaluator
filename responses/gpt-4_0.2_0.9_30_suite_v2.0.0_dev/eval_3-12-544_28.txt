The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to use Flutter's engine before it's ready. In your `main()` function, you're trying to access the application's document directory before `runApp()` is called, which initializes the Flutter engine.

To fix this, you need to ensure that the Flutter engine is initialized before you try to access the application's document directory. You can do this by using `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

`WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` ensures that the Flutter engine is ready before you try to use it.
