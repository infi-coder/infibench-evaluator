The error is because you are trying to create an index on a navigation property `Gender`. Entity Framework Core does not support this. 

Indexes in Entity Framework Core are used to speed up the performance of data retrieval operations on a database. They are only applicable to scalar properties (like `int`, `string`, `bool`, etc.) and not navigation properties (like `Gender` in your case).

To solve this problem, you should create an index on the `GenderId` property instead of the `Gender` navigation property. Here is how you can do it:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);` creates an index on the `GenderId` property.
