You can use `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton`, and `TextButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property. 

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with `border-radius` in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {},
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20), // 20 is the radius
    ),
  ),
  child: Text('Button'),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton` is used to create a button. The `shape` property is set to `RoundedRectangleBorder` with a `borderRadius` of 20. This will create a button with rounded corners. The `onPressed` function is currently empty, you can replace it with your own function.
