The `@Autowired` annotation is not necessary if the target bean only defines one constructor. In such cases, Spring will use that constructor for autowiring.

However, if there are multiple constructors, Spring won't know which one to choose, so you need to add `@Autowired` to the constructor you want Spring to use for autowiring.

Also, using `@Autowired` makes it explicit that Spring is managing the dependency injection, which can be helpful for readability and understanding the code.
