The error you're seeing is because the `map-loop` function is not a built-in Sass function, and it's not defined in your code. It seems like you're trying to override the `$theme-colors` map, but you're not providing a valid color value.

Here's how you can override the `$theme-colors` map:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color, // replace #your-color with your desired color
  "secondary": $gray-600,
  "success": $green,
  "info": $cyan,
  "warning": $yellow,
  "danger": $red,
  "light": $gray-100,
  "dark": $gray-800
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

In this code, replace `#your-color` with the color you want to use for the primary theme color. The other colors are using the default Bootstrap color variables, but you can replace them with your own colors as well.

Remember to replace `#your-color` with a valid CSS color value, such as `#ff0000` for red, or `#00ff00` for green, etc.
