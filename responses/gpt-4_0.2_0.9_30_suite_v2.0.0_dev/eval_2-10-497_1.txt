In Rust, the `Box<T>` type is a smart pointer that points to data on the heap. It cannot be null, because Rust ensures that all references (including `Box<T>`) are always valid (except for the special case of `NonNull<T>`). This is a key part of Rust's safety guarantees.

If you want to have an optional `Box<T>`, you can use the `Option<Box<T>>` type. This type can be either `Some(boxed_value)` or `None`.

Here's how you can modify your `Node` and `Stack` structs to use `Option<Box<Node>>`:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

Now, you can check if the `top` of the stack is `None` (which would be similar to a null pointer in other languages):

```rust
if let Some(node) = &stack.top {
    // The top of the stack is not null.
} else {
    // The top of the stack is null.
}
```

Or, using the `is_none` and `is_some` methods:

```rust
if stack.top.is_some() {
    // The top of the stack is not null.
} else if stack.top.is_none() {
    // The top of the stack is null.
}
```

Remember, in Rust, you don't have to manually check for null pointers as you do in languages like C++. The `Option` type is used to explicitly handle the case where a value might be absent, and Rust's type system will ensure you handle both the `Some` and `None` cases when using an `Option`.
