The error message is indicating that the `go_package` option is missing in your proto file. This option is used to specify the full Go package path. 

You can fix this by adding the `go_package` option to your proto file. Here is an example:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "github.com/yourusername/yourrepository/yourpackage";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

Replace `"github.com/yourusername/yourrepository/yourpackage"` with the actual Go package path where you want the generated Go code to reside.

After you've added the `go_package` option, you should be able to generate the Go code without any issues.
