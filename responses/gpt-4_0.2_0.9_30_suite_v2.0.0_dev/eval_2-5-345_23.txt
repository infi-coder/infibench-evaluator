This error is due to a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version (3.8.5) that comes with Spring Boot 2.7. The error message indicates that IntelliJ IDEA is unable to find a method in the `DefaultModelValidator` class in the Maven version you're using.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following solutions:

1. **Downgrade Maven version:** You can change the Maven version in your project to a version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA. To do this, you can modify the `pom.xml` file in your project and specify the Maven version in the `maven-wrapper.properties` file.

2. **Update IntelliJ IDEA:** Check if there's an update available for IntelliJ IDEA. JetBrains regularly releases updates for IntelliJ IDEA to fix bugs and improve compatibility with different tools and frameworks. You can check for updates by going to `Help > Check for Updates...` in IntelliJ IDEA.

3. **Invalidating IntelliJ IDEA caches:** Sometimes, IntelliJ IDEA caches can cause issues. You can try invalidating these caches and restarting IntelliJ IDEA. To do this, go to `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart...` in IntelliJ IDEA.

Remember to always backup your project before making any changes.
