The error you're encountering is due to the fact that AWS Lambda expects a Linux binary, but you're providing a Windows binary. When you run `go build main.go` on a Windows machine, it generates a Windows binary (main.exe), which cannot be executed in the Linux environment of AWS Lambda.

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code to create a Linux binary. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables before building your Go code.

Here is how you can do it:

```bash
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -o main main.go
```

This will create a Linux binary named `main`. You can then zip this file and upload it to AWS Lambda.

```bash
zip function.zip main
```

Remember to set the handler name to `main` when you upload the zip file to AWS Lambda.

Please note that if you're using any C dependencies in your Go code, you'll need to set up a proper cross-compilation environment. For simple Go programs, the above steps should work fine.
