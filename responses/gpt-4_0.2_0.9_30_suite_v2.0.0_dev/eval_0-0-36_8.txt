```javascript
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

export default function Component(){
    const router = useRouter();

    const reloadPage = () => {
        router.replace(router.asPath);
    }
}
```
In the above code, `router.replace(router.asPath)` will trigger a client-side reload in Next.js. The `router.asPath` gives the path of the current page. By replacing the current path with the same path, it will force Next.js to reload the page on the client side.
