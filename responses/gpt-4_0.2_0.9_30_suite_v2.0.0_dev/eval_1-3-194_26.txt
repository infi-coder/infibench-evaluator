You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write to an Excel file. Here is the function `writeToExcel`:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = Workbook()

    # grab the active worksheet
    ws = wb.active

    # write the rows to the active worksheet
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        ws.append(new_list[i])

    # Save the file
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

In this function, we first create a new Workbook. Then we grab the active worksheet and append the rows from `new_list` to the worksheet. Finally, we save the workbook to a file named "data.xlsx".
