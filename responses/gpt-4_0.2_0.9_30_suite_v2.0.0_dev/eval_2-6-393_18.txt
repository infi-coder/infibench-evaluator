The error you're getting is because you're trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`). Entity Framework doesn't support creating indexes on navigation properties directly. 

Indexes in Entity Framework are used to speed up the performance of data retrieval operations on a database. They are typically created on columns that are frequently searched or that are used in JOIN, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, or top-N queries. 

In your case, if you want to create an index, it should be on `GenderId` not on `Gender`. 

Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

This will create an index on the `GenderId` column of the `User` table.
