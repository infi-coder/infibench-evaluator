The error message is telling you that you can't create an index on a navigation property. In Entity Framework Core, indexes can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property, you should do it like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In the code above, the `HasIndex` method is called on the `GenderId` property, which is a scalar property, not a navigation property. This should solve your problem.
