Sure, here is a simple bash script to install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current python version
brew unlink python

# Install the specific python version
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed python version
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will install Python 3.6, not specifically 3.6.5. Homebrew does not support installing minor versions of packages. If you need a specific minor version, you would need to use a different tool, such as pyenv.
