It seems like there's a misunderstanding here. iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" that you can enable or disable like Android. 

The alert you're seeing is likely related to the provisioning profile used to sign the app. If the app was signed with a Development Provisioning Profile, it can only be installed on devices that are registered with your Apple Developer account.

Here are the steps to register your device with your Apple Developer account:

1. Connect your device to your Mac.
2. Open Xcode.
3. Go to `Window` -> `Devices and Simulators`.
4. Under the `Devices` tab, select your device.
5. Click on the `+` button under the `Installed Apps` section.
6. Select the .ipa file of your app and click `Open`.

If you're not the developer of the app, you'll need to ask the developer to sign the app with an Ad Hoc Provisioning Profile, which allows the app to be installed on a limited number of devices without them being registered with the developer's Apple Developer account. 

Alternatively, if the app is for public testing, the developer can use TestFlight to distribute the app, which doesn't require the devices to be registered with the developer's Apple Developer account.
