The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`. It's actually part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

You need to make sure that you have the appropriate Entity Framework Core package installed in your project. If you're using .NET Core 3.x, you should install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package version 3.x. If you're using .NET 5, you should install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package version 5.x.

Once you have the correct package installed, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute by adding the following using directive at the top of your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Then, you can use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class like this:

```csharp
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    // ...
}
```

And in your `DbContext`:

```csharp
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

And you can use it like this:

```csharp
_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)
```

Remember that keyless entities (entities that don't have a primary key defined) can only be used for read-only operations. You can't add, update, or delete instances of a keyless entity type.
