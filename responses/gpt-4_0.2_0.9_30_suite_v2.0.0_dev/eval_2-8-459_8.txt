The error message indicates that Go is unable to find the specified version of the module. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as network issues, incorrect configuration, or the specified version not being available.

Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. **Check your network connection**: Make sure you have a stable internet connection and you are able to access the repository URL in your browser.

2. **Check your Go version**: Ensure you're using a recent version of Go that supports modules. You can check your Go version by running `go version` in your terminal.

3. **Check your Go environment**: Run `go env` to check your Go environment variables. The `GOPROXY` environment variable should be set to `https://proxy.golang.org,direct` or `https://goproxy.io,direct` to use the Go module proxy.

4. **Check your Git configuration**: If the repository is private, you need to make sure your Git is configured correctly to access it. You can do this by running `git config --global --get user.name` and `git config --global --get user.email` to check your Git username and email. If these are not set correctly, you can set them with `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`.

5. **Check your GitHub credentials**: Make sure your GitHub credentials are correctly set up on computer B. If the repository is private, you need to authenticate with GitHub to access it. You can do this by creating a personal access token on GitHub and using it as your password when Git prompts you for it.

6. **Check the module version**: Make sure the specified version of the module is available in the repository. You can do this by visiting the repository URL and checking the list of tags or releases.

7. **Try to download the module manually**: You can try to download the module manually by running `go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5`. If this fails, the error message may give you more information about what's going wrong.

8. **Check the go.mod file**: Make sure the go.mod file in your repository is correct. The module path should match the repository URL, and the required versions of dependencies should be available.

9. **Clear the module cache**: If all else fails, you can try clearing your
