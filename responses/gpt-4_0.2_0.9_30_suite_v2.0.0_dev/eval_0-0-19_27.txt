The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` suggests that npm is unable to find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry. 

However, the correct name for the AWS SDK in the npm registry is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`. 

So, you should install the package using the correct name:

```bash
npm install --verbose aws-sdk
```

This should resolve the issue.
