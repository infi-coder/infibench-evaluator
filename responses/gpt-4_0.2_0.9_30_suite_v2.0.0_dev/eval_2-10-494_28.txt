The error you're seeing is likely an issue with rust-analyzer, not your code. Rust-analyzer is a language server that provides IDE-like features for Rust, such as autocompletion, go-to-definition, and error checking. However, it's not always perfect and can sometimes produce false positives or negatives.

The error message "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args`" suggests that rust-analyzer is having trouble understanding a macro expansion. This is a known issue with rust-analyzer, especially when macros are involved. 

If your code is compiling and passing tests, then it's likely that your code is fine and this is a false positive from rust-analyzer.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Update rust-analyzer**: If you're using an older version of rust-analyzer, updating to the latest version might resolve the issue.

2. **Restart your editor**: Sometimes, simply restarting your editor can help rust-analyzer to correctly analyze your code.

3. **Check your rust-analyzer settings**: Make sure that rust-analyzer is correctly configured for your project. For example, if you're using a workspace, make sure that rust-analyzer is set up to handle workspaces.

4. **Ignore the error**: If the error is not affecting your ability to write or compile code, you can choose to ignore it. However, this is not ideal as it could mask other, legitimate issues.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider filing an issue on the rust-analyzer GitHub page. The maintainers are usually quite responsive and might be able to help you resolve the issue.
