The error you're seeing is because you're trying to use asynchronous code (`await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`) in the `main()` function without marking it as `async`. However, in Flutter, the `main()` function can't be asynchronous.

To fix this, you should move your asynchronous code to the `initState()` method of your widget. Here's how you can do it:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initHive();
  }

  Future<void> initHive() async {
    final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Demo Home Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('You have pushed the button this many times:'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, I've moved the Hive initialization to the `initState()` method of `MyHomePage` widget. The `initHive()` method is marked as `async` and it's where the asynchronous code is executed.
