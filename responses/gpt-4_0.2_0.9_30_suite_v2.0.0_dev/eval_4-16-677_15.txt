The issue is with the single quotes around `$searchT` in your `grep` command. Single quotes in bash will prevent variable expansion, so `grep` is actually looking for the literal string `$searchT` instead of the value of the variable `searchT`.

You should use double quotes instead:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

This will allow `grep` to use the value of the variable `searchT` as the search term. Also, I've moved `| wc -l` to correctly count the number of matches.
