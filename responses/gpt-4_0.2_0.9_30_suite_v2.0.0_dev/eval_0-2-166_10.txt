Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements as you would do in traditional CSS. It doesn't support child selectors or any other kind of selectors. 

The main idea behind Tailwind CSS is to apply styles directly to the HTML elements via utility classes, rather than defining CSS selectors and rulesets.

So, if you want to style direct children of a div with a class of "section", you would need to apply the classes directly to those child div elements in your HTML.

For example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 ...">...</div>
  <div class="text-lg ...">...</div>
  <!-- more child divs -->
</div>
```

In the above example, `bg-blue-500` and `text-lg` are Tailwind CSS utility classes applied directly to the child divs.

If you need to apply styles based on child selectors, you would need to use traditional CSS or CSS preprocessor like Sass, Less alongside Tailwind CSS.
