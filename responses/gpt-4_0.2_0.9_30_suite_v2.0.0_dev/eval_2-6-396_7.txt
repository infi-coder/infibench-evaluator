The error message is indicating that you're trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`), which is not allowed. 

Indexes in Entity Framework Core are used to speed up the performance of data retrieval operations on a database. They are only applicable to scalar properties of an entity, not navigation properties.

If you want to create an index on `GenderId` (the foreign key), you can do it like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);` creates an index on the `GenderId` column in the `User` table.
