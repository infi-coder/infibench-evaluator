The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that the `map-loop` function is not a built-in Sass function, and it's not defined anywhere in your code or in Bootstrap's code. 

In order to override Bootstrap's default theme colors, you should define your `$theme-colors` map before importing Bootstrap. Here's how you can do it:

```scss
// Import Bootstrap's functions first
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";

// Define your custom colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #ff0000, // Replace with your color
  "secondary": #6c757d,
  "success": #198754,
  "info": #0dcaf0,
  "warning": #ffc107,
  "danger": #dc3545,
  "light": #f8f9fa,
  "dark": #212529
);

// Then import the rest of Bootstrap
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

In this example, I've replaced the primary color with red (`#ff0000`). You should replace it with your desired color. 

Also, make sure to define all the colors in the `$theme-colors` map, not just the one you want to change. If you omit any color, it will not be defined and you might get an error or unexpected results.
