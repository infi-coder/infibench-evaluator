You can use the factory pattern to create different instances of `ServiceBusClient` and `ServiceBusSender` with different queue names. Here's an example of how you can do it:

First, define a factory interface:
```c#
public interface IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    ServiceBusSender CreateSender(string queueName);
}
```

Then, implement the factory:
```c#
public class ServiceBusClientFactory : IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    private readonly string _connectionString;

    public ServiceBusClientFactory(string connectionString)
    {
        _connectionString = connectionString;
    }

    public ServiceBusSender CreateSender(string queueName)
    {
        var client = new ServiceBusClient(_connectionString);
        return client.CreateSender(queueName);
    }
}
```

Register the factory in your DI container:
```c#
_services.AddSingleton<IServiceBusClientFactory>(sp =>
{
    var serviceBusConfiguration = sp.GetRequiredService<IOptions<UserEventConsumerSetting>>().Value;
    return new ServiceBusClientFactory(serviceBusConfiguration.ServiceBusConnectionString);
});
```

Now, you can inject the factory into your service and create senders for different queues:
```c#
public class CarReservationMessagingService
{
    private readonly ServiceBusSender _serviceBusSender;

    public CarReservationMessagingService(IServiceBusClientFactory serviceBusClientFactory)
    {
        _serviceBusSender = serviceBusClientFactory.CreateSender("queueName");
    }

    // ...
}
```

This way, you can create as many `ServiceBusSender` instances as you need, each with a different queue name. You just need to pass the queue name to the `CreateSender` method of the factory.
