The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. It's an extension for handling ZIP archives. You can't install it via Composer.

If you are using a Unix-like operating system, you can install it via `pecl`:

```bash
pecl install zip
```

Or, if you are using Ubuntu, you can install it via `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you are using Windows, you can enable it in your `php.ini` file by uncommenting or adding this line:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing or enabling the extension, you may need to restart your web server for the changes to take effect.

Then, in your `composer.json` file, you can require the zip extension like this:

```json
"require": {
    "php": ">=7.1.3",
    "ext-zip": "*"
}
```

This won't actually install the extension, but it will prevent Composer from installing your project unless the zip extension is present.
