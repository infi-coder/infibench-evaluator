The error message `Parsing error: Cannot read file '.../tsconfig.json'.eslint` indicates that ESLint is unable to find or read the `tsconfig.json` file. This is likely because the path to the `tsconfig.json` file in your `.eslintrc.js` file is incorrect.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the path to `tsconfig.json` as:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This means that ESLint is looking for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file. If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory, you will need to provide the correct relative path.

For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would need to change the path to:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "../tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in a different subdirectory, you would need to adjust the path accordingly.

If you're not sure where your `tsconfig.json` file is, you can use a command like `find . -name tsconfig.json` in your project's root directory to find it.

Once you have updated the path to `tsconfig.json` in your `.eslintrc.js` file, you should restart your IDE or text editor to ensure the changes are picked up. If you're still seeing the error, you may need to clear your ESLint cache again.
