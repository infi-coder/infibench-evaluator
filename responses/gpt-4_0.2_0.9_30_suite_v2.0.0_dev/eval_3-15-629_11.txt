You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. This object is part of the Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library. Here is a simple example:

```vba
Dim MyData As DataObject

Set MyData = New DataObject
MyData.SetText Me.NodeKey.Value
MyData.PutInClipboard
```

This code will copy the value of `Me.NodeKey.Value` to the clipboard.

If you get an error about `DataObject` being undefined, you may need to set a reference to the Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library. You can do this by:

1. Go to the VBA editor (Alt + F11).
2. Go to Tools > References.
3. Scroll down and check "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library".
4. Click OK.

After doing this, you should be able to use the `DataObject` in your code.
