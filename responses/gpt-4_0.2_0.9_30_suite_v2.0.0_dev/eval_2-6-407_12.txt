The exception you're seeing is a `JsonException` with the message `'<' is an invalid start of a value.`. This usually happens when the response from the server is not a valid JSON. It could be an HTML error page or something else.

The problem might be in the route of your API method. In your `EmployeeController`, you have defined the route as `[Route("api/Employee/Index")]`. However, in the controller's route attribute, you have defined `[Route("[controller]")]`. This means that the final route to your method would be `/Employee/api/Employee/Index`.

Try changing the route in your `EmployeeController` to this:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class EmployeeController : ControllerBase
{
    EmployeeRepository objemployee = new EmployeeRepository();
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Employee> Index()
    {
        return objemployee.GetAllEmployees();
    }
}
```

And then in your Blazor component, call the API like this:

```csharp
empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("api/Employee");
```

This should solve the problem if it was caused by an incorrect route.

If the problem persists, you might want to check the response from the server manually. You can do this by calling the API from a tool like Postman or even from your browser and see what you get. If you get an HTML page (which starts with '<'), then you need to fix the server-side code to return a valid JSON.
