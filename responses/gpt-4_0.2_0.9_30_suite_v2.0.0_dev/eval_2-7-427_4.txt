For the CSRF token mismatch error, there are several things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the `public` directory of your Laravel application. Incorrect domain configuration can cause session issues.

2. **Session Domain**: In your `config/session.php` file, check the `domain` option. If it's set to a specific value, try setting it to `null`.

3. **Middleware**: Ensure that the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is included in the `web` middleware group in your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

4. **Cookies**: Check if cookies are being correctly set in the browser. If your application is under HTTPS, ensure that the `secure` option in your `config/session.php` file is set to `true`.

For the email sending issue, the error message indicates that there's a problem with the SSL version. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Encryption Type**: Change the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` in your `.env` file from `ssl` to `tls`. Some servers require `tls` instead of `ssl`.

2. **Port Number**: Try changing the `MAIL_PORT` in your `.env` file to `465` if you're using `ssl` or to `25` if you're using `tls`.

3. **Mail Host**: Ensure that the `MAIL_HOST` is correct. You might need to contact your client to confirm this.

4. **OpenSSL Extension**: Check if the OpenSSL extension is enabled in your PHP configuration. You can do this by creating a `phpinfo()` file.

Remember to clear the configuration cache by running `php artisan config:clear` after making changes to the `.env` file or configuration files.
