It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a web-developerâ€™s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow: it allows you to type CSS-like expressions that can be dynamically parsed, and produce output depending on what you type in the abbreviation.

For example, if you type `.classname` and press `Tab`, it will automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If it's not working for you, it might be because:

1. You don't have Emmet installed or enabled in your code editor. Emmet comes pre-installed with many popular code editors like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc. Make sure it's enabled in your editor's settings.

2. You're not pressing the `Tab` key after typing the abbreviation. The `Tab` key is what triggers Emmet to expand the abbreviation.

3. Your file might not be saved with a `.html` extension. Emmet only works in files that it recognizes as HTML or CSS.

4. Your cursor might be in the wrong place. Make sure your cursor is at the end of the abbreviation when you press `Tab`.

If you're still having trouble, I recommend checking the documentation for Emmet in your specific code editor.
