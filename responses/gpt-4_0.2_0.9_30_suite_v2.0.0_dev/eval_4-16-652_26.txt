The AWS CLI uses a pager program to handle its output. By default, it uses the `less` program. The pager is used to make it easier to read output that does not fit on one screen. However, in your case, it's causing an issue.

To disable the pager, you can set the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. You can do this in your script before running the AWS CLI commands:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will disable the pager for the duration of the script.

If you want to disable the pager permanently, you can add the `export AWS_PAGER=""` line to your shell's initialization file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for Bash, or `~/.zshrc` for Zsh).

If you want to redirect the output to a file, you can use the `>` operator:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > output.txt; 
done
```

This will write the output of each command to `output.txt`. If you want to append to the file instead of overwriting it each time, use `>>` instead of `>`.
