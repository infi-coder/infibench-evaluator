Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. You're trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you haven't declared them. In VBA, you need to declare your variables with `Dim`.

2. The `query` variable is supposed to hold the name of your query, but you're assigning it the value of a cell. If the cell contains the name of your query, that's fine. If it contains the actual query, you'll need to create a Power Query in your workbook and use its name.

3. The `currentSheet` variable is not used in your code. If you want to use it to specify the sheet where the data should be loaded, you should replace `"target"` with `currentSheet`.

Here's a revised version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As String

    ' Get the name of the query from Sheet6, cell A1
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Get the name of the active sheet
    currentSheet = ActiveSheet.Name

    ' Create a ListObject with a Query Table
    With ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets(currentSheet).Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code assumes that you have a Power Query in your workbook with the name stored in cell A1 of Sheet6. It loads the data from the query to the active sheet, starting at cell A1.
