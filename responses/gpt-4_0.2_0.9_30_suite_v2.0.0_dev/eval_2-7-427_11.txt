## CSRF Token Mismatch

The CSRF token mismatch issue could be due to a couple of reasons:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the `public` directory of your Laravel application. Incorrect domain configuration can cause issues with session handling.

2. **Cookie Domain**: Check your `config/session.php` file and ensure that the `domain` configuration is correctly set. If your application is on a subdomain, you should set the `domain` configuration to your root domain (e.g., `.yourdomain.com`).

3. **Session Driver**: If you're using a different session driver on your production server, ensure that it's correctly configured. For example, if you're using the `redis` or `database` session driver, ensure that Redis or your database is correctly set up and accessible.

4. **HTTPS**: If your production server is using HTTPS, ensure that the `secure` option in your `config/session.php` file is set to `true`. This is because cookies will not be sent over an insecure connection when this option is set to `true`.

## Email Sending Issue

The error message you're seeing is related to the SSL protocol version being used. It seems like the mail server you're trying to connect to is using a different SSL protocol version than your application is expecting.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Change Encryption Type**: Try changing `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` in your `.env` file from `ssl` to `tls`. Some servers use the newer TLS protocol instead of SSL.

2. **Change Port Number**: The port number you're using (587) is typically used with the `tls` encryption. If you're using `ssl` encryption, try changing the `MAIL_PORT` to 465.

3. **Disable Encryption**: As a last resort, you can try disabling encryption altogether to see if that resolves the issue. However, this is not recommended for production environments as it can expose sensitive information.

Remember to clear your config cache (`php artisan config:cache`) after making changes to your `.env` file.
