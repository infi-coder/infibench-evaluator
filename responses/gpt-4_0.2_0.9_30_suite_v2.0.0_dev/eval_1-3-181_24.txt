Sure, you can use the `numpy.amax()` function to find the maximum value along an axis. Here is the function you need:

```python
import numpy as np

def getMax(matrix):
    # Convert the input to a numpy array
    matrix = np.array(matrix)
    
    # Select the third column from each 2D array in the 3D array
    third_column = matrix[:,:,2]
    
    # Find the maximum value in each 2D array
    max_values = np.amax(third_column, axis=1)
    
    # Reshape the result to a 2D array
    max_values = max_values.reshape(-1, 1)
    
    return max_values
```

This function works by first selecting the third column from each 2D array in the 3D array. It then finds the maximum value in each of these columns and reshapes the result to a 2D array.

Please note that in Python, indices start at 0, so the third column is indexed by 2.
