The error you're encountering is because the 'year' column contains floating point numbers represented as strings, and you're trying to convert them directly to integers. Python's `int()` function doesn't handle this well.

You can solve this by first converting the strings to floats, and then converting those floats to integers. Here is the function you asked for:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

This function first converts the 'year' column to float, then to int. This will handle the '2021.0' strings correctly.
