The error message `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'` is indicating that Python can't find your `app` module. This is likely due to a problem with the way your Dockerfile is set up.

Here's a revised version of your Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8

# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Add the current directory contents into the container at /app
ADD . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
COPY requirements.txt /app
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /app/requirements.txt

# Make port 8000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the command to start uVicorn server
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]
```

This Dockerfile will add the entire current directory (which should include your `app` directory and its contents) into the Docker container at `/app`. It then installs the Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`, and finally, it starts the uVicorn server.

Please make sure that your `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly set up as well. Here's an example of how it might look:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

This `docker-compose.yml` file will build the Docker image according to the Dockerfile in the current directory, start a container from that image, and run the specified command in that container. It also maps the container's port 8000 to port 8000 on the host machine.
