This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being associated with a target. Here's how you can fix it:

1. Open your SwiftUI file.
2. Click on the file name at the top of the editor.
3. Click on "Show File Inspector" (the first icon on the right panel).
4. Under the "Target Membership" section, make sure your app's target is checked.

If the target is already checked, try the following:

1. Clean your project (Product -> Clean Build Folder).
2. Close Xcode.
3. Delete derived data (~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData).
4. Restart your computer.
5. Open Xcode and try again.

If the problem persists, it might be a bug in Xcode 12.3. You can report it to Apple via their Feedback Assistant.
