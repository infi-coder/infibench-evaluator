You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write to an Excel file. Here is the function you requested:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active

    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
            ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new Excel file named "data.xlsx" and writes the contents of `new_list` into it. The `openpyxl` library provides the `Workbook` class for creating new Excel files, and the `Worksheet` class for adding data to those files. The `cell` method is used to write data to a specific cell in the worksheet, and the `save` method is used to save the changes to the file.

Please note that you need to install `openpyxl` library if it's not already installed. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install openpyxl
```
