It seems like there's a bit of confusion here. iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" like Android does. Instead, you can enable developer options by connecting your iOS device to a Mac and using Xcode.

Here are the steps to enable developer options:

1. Install Xcode on your Mac. You can download it for free from the Mac App Store.

2. Connect your iOS device to your Mac using a USB cable.

3. Open Xcode and go to `Window -> Devices and Simulators`.

4. Select your iOS device from the list on the left.

5. If necessary, click the `Use for Development` button.

After doing this, you should be able to install and run provisioned apps on your iOS device. If you're still having trouble, make sure that the app's provisioning profile includes your device's UDID.

Also, keep in mind that you need to be part of the Apple Developer Program to use many of the features in Xcode's developer tools. The Apple Developer Program costs $99 per year.
