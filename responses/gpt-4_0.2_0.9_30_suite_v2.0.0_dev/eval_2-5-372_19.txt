It seems like you are facing a version conflict issue. Hibernate Validator 5.x does not support `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` for `String` types. These constraints are supported from Hibernate Validator 6.x onwards.

In your case, it seems like JBoss is loading Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2, which is not compatible with `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` for `String` types.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Exclude the Hibernate Validator brought by JBoss:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

2. Add the Hibernate Validator 6.x to your project dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

3. If the above steps do not work, you may need to upgrade your JBoss version or switch to another application server that does not bring Hibernate Validator 5.x.

Remember to clean and rebuild your project after making these changes.
