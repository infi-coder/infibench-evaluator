Your code seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you can check if the loading state is stuck at `true` and the data is not fetched:

1. **Network Connection**: Make sure your device or emulator has a proper internet connection. Sometimes, network issues can cause the loading state to hang.

2. **Server Status**: Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can do this by visiting the URL in a web browser.

3. **GraphQL Query**: Ensure that the GraphQL query is correct and the server supports it. You can test the query using a GraphQL client like GraphiQL or Apollo Studio.

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading or upgrading the version.

5. **React Native Version**: Check if the version of React Native you're using is compatible with the Apollo Client version. You might need to upgrade or downgrade it.

6. **Error Handling**: Add more detailed error handling to see if there's an error message being returned from the server. You can log the `error` object to see more details.

```javascript
if (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
}
```

7. **React Native Debugger**: Use React Native Debugger to inspect the network requests and responses. This can help you identify if the request is being sent and what response is being received.

If none of these steps help, it might be a more complex issue that requires a deeper investigation.
