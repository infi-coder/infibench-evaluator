The problem you're facing is due to the asynchronous nature of the `onItemSelectedListener`. The `onItemSelected` function is not immediately called when you set the listener. It is called later when an item is actually selected in the spinner. 

This is why you're seeing the log "2" before "1". The function `setupListWithAdapter` continues to execute after setting the listener and returns `itemSelected` (which is still an empty string at this point), and only later when you select an item, `onItemSelected` is called and `itemSelected` is updated.

To fix this, you should not return a value from `setupListWithAdapter`. Instead, you should handle the selected item directly inside `onItemSelected`. If you need to use the selected item outside of this function, consider using a callback interface or a shared ViewModel (if you're using MVVM architecture).

Here's an example of how you might use a callback:

```kotlin
interface OnItemSelectedListener {
    fun onItemSelected(item: String)
}

fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>, callback: OnItemSelectedListener) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            Log.e("categoryLog","1 : " + itemSelected)
            callback.onItemSelected(itemSelected)
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
}
```

Then, when you call `setupListWithAdapter`, you provide an instance of `OnItemSelectedListener` where you handle the selected item:

```kotlin
spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list, object : OnItemSelectedListener {
    override fun onItemSelected(item: String) {
        // Handle the selected item here
    }
})
```
