The `[Keyless]` attribute is part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace, not the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. 

You need to install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` NuGet package to your project and then include the namespace in your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

After that, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class:

```csharp
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    // ...
}
```

If you already have `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` installed and you still can't find the `[Keyless]` attribute, make sure that your Entity Framework Core version is 3.0 or later, as the `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in EF Core 3.0. If you're using an older version, you'll need to update to a newer version to use this attribute.
