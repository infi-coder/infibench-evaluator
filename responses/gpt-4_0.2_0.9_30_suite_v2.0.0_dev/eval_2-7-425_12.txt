You can use the `now()` function provided by Laravel to get the current date and time. Here is how you can modify your function to store the current date and time in the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields:

```php
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array(
        "name" => $name, 
        "address" => $address, 
        "created_at" => now(), 
        "updated_at" => now()
    );
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

The `now()` function will return the current date and time in the format `Y-m-d H:i:s`, which is the format MySQL uses for datetime fields.

Please note that if your table is using Laravel's Eloquent ORM and has `$timestamps = true;` in the model, Laravel will automatically handle the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields for you.
