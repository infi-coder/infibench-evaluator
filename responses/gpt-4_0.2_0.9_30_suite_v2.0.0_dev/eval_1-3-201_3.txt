You can use Python's multiprocessing module to run these two tasks concurrently. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
from multiprocessing import Process

app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
database=db.dataBase()
homepage=hp.homepage(database)
homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()

def run_dash():
    app.run_server(debug=True)

def run_data_mining():
    while True:
        dataMiningScript.run()  # Assuming run() is the method that starts the data mining

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create process for dash
    Process(target=run_dash).start()
    # Create process for data mining
    Process(target=run_data_mining).start()
```

This will create two separate processes, one for running the Dash server and another for running the data mining script. Both will run independently of each other.

Please note that you need to replace `dataMiningScript.run()` with the actual method that starts the data mining in your `financeData` class.

Also, be aware that multiprocessing has its own set of challenges, especially when it comes to sharing data between processes. If your `financeData` class needs to share data with the Dash app, you might need to use a multiprocessing-safe data structure or use a database as an intermediary.
