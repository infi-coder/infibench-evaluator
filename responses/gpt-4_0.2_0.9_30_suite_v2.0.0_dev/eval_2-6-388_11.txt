The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It's part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

This attribute was introduced in EF Core 5.0. If you're using an older version of EF Core, you won't have access to this attribute. 

To use it, you need to add a reference to the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace at the top of your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Then you can use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class:

```csharp
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    // other properties...
}
```

If you're using an older version of EF Core, you can use the `.HasNoKey()` method in your `DbContext` to achieve the same result:

```csharp
public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<MyKeylessClass>().HasNoKey();
    }
}
```

Remember to update your EF Core package to the latest version if you want to use the `[Keyless]` attribute. You can do this through the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio, or by running the following command in your package manager console:

```
Update-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
```
