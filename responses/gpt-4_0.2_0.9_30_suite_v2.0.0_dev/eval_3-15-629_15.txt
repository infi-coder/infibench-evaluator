You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. Here's how you can do it:

First, you need to add a reference to `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library`. To do this:

1. In the VBA editor, go to `Tools` -> `References`.
2. In the `References` dialog box, scroll down and check `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library` and click `OK`.

Then, you can use the following code to copy text to the clipboard:

```vba
Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject

DataObj.SetText Me.NodeKey.Value
DataObj.PutInClipboard
```

This code creates a new `DataObject`, sets its text to the value of `Me.NodeKey.Value`, and then puts it in the clipboard.
