The error you're encountering is due to the fact that AWS Lambda expects a Linux executable, but you're building your Go application on a Windows machine, which produces a Windows executable. 

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code for Linux. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables before building your Go application.

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build main.go
```

This will produce a Linux executable named `main` which you can then zip and upload to AWS Lambda.

Also, make sure that the generated binary file has execution permissions. If not, you can add them using the `chmod` command in Linux or using Git Bash in Windows:

```bash
chmod +x main
```

After these steps, you should be able to execute your Lambda function without encountering the `fork/exec /var/task/main: no such file or directory` error.
