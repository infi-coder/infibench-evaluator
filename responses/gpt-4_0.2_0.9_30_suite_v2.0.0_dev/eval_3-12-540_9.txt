Yes, in Flutter, you can draw vertical lines between components using the `VerticalDivider` widget. 

Here is a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line is drawn between two text components. The `VerticalDivider` widget has several properties that you can adjust to suit your needs:

- `color`: This changes the color of the line.
- `thickness`: This changes the thickness of the line.
- `width`: This changes the total width of the line, including the empty space on either side of it.

Remember to wrap your components with the `Expanded` widget to ensure they take up the remaining space in the row.
