Here is a Python function that should solve your problem:

```python
def divideNumber(num, n):
    # Calculate the base value and the remainder
    base, remainder = divmod(num, n)
    
    # Ensure the base value is a multiple of 2
    if base % 2 != 0:
        base -= 1
        remainder += n

    # Create the result list with the base value
    result = [base] * n

    # Distribute the remainder by adding 2 to each part in succession
    for i in range(0, remainder, 2):
        result[i // 2] += 2

    return result
```

This function first calculates the base value and the remainder of the division. If the base value is not a multiple of 2, it decreases the base value by 1 and increases the remainder accordingly. Then it creates a list with the base value. Finally, it distributes the remainder by adding 2 to each part in succession.

Let's test it with your example:

```python
print(divideNumber(100, 3))  # Output: [34, 34, 32]
```

This function assumes that `num` is always even and `n` is always greater than 0. If these conditions are not met, the function may not work as expected.
