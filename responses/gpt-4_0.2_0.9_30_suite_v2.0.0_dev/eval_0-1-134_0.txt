It seems like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow. 

For example, if you type `.classname` and press `Tab`, it will automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If it's not working for you, here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check if your text editor supports Emmet**: Emmet is built-in in many text editors like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, etc. If you're using a text editor that doesn't support Emmet, you may need to install it manually.

2. **Check if Emmet is enabled**: If your text editor supports Emmet, make sure it's enabled. For example, in VS Code, you can check this by going to `File > Preferences > Settings` and searching for Emmet.

3. **Check your syntax**: Make sure you're using the correct Emmet abbreviations. For example, `.classname` will create a `div` with the class `classname`. If you want to create an element other than a `div`, you need to specify it, like `p.classname` for a `p` element with the class `classname`.

4. **Check your file type**: Emmet usually works out of the box with HTML and CSS files. If you're working in a different type of file (like a JavaScript or PHP file), you may need to manually set the file type to HTML or CSS for Emmet to work.

If you've checked all of these and it's still not working, you may need to look into more specific troubleshooting for your particular text editor.
