The `Get-Service` cmdlet does not return the description of the service. However, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to get the description of the service. Here is an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service" | Select-Object Name, Description | Out-GridView
```

This command uses the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to get information about all services. The `Select-Object` cmdlet is used to select the `Name` and `Description` properties of each service. The `Out-GridView` cmdlet is used to display the output in a grid view.

If you want to get the description of a specific service, you can modify the WMI query. For example, to get the description of the `wuauserv` service, you can use the following command:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service Where Name='wuauserv'" | Select-Object Name, Description
```

This command uses the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to get information about the `wuauserv` service. The `Select-Object` cmdlet is used to select the `Name` and `Description` properties of the service.
