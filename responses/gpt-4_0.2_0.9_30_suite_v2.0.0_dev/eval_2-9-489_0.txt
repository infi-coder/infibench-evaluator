The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. This means that without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file (`elasticsearch.yml`). The location of this file depends on your installation. For Homebrew on Mac, it's typically located at `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`.

2. Add the following lines to the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

    ```yml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

Please note that enabling security will require you to use a username and password to interact with Elasticsearch. The default username is `elastic`. To set the password, you can use the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` command-line tool:

```bash
./bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto
```

This will generate random passwords for all built-in users (`elastic`, `apm_system`, `kibana_system`, `logstash_system`, `beats_system`, `remote_monitoring_user`).

Remember to update your application's Elasticsearch client configuration to include the username and password.

For Searchkick in a Rails application, you can do this in `config/initializers/searchkick.rb`:

```ruby
Searchkick.client = Elasticsearch::Client.new(
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"],
  http_auth: {user: "elastic", password: "your_generated_password"}
)
```

Replace `"your_generated_password"` with the actual password generated by the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` tool.

Finally, restart your Rails server for the changes to take effect.
