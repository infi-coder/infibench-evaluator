You can achieve this by using the `itertools.cycle` function, which returns an iterator that produces elements from the iterable until it is exhausted, then repeats the sequence indefinitely.

Here is the function `fillColumn` in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
import itertools

def fillColumn(df, columnName, columnData):
    cycle = itertools.cycle(columnData)
    df[columnName] = [next(cycle) for _ in range(len(df))]
    return df
```

This function creates an infinite iterator from `columnData` using `itertools.cycle`, then uses a list comprehension to generate a list of the same length as the DataFrame `df`. This list is then assigned to the new column in the DataFrame. 

You can use this function like this:

```python
my_list = ['abc','def','hig']
df = fillColumn(df, 'names', my_list)
```

This will fill the 'names' column in the DataFrame `df` with the values in `my_list`, repeating them as necessary until all rows in the DataFrame have been filled.
