The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It is part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace.

You should have the Entity Framework Core package installed in your project. If you don't have it, you can install it via NuGet package manager.

```shell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
```

After installing the package, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class by including the correct namespace:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    // ...
}
```

Remember that `[Keyless]` attribute is used to denote that an entity does not have a key and should never be tracked for changes in the DbContext. It is typically used for read-only entities which are mapped to database views or queries.
