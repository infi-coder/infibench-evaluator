You can achieve this by using the `split` function in R, which divides the data into subsets based on the levels of a factor. Here is the function `myConvert`:

```r
library(tidyverse)

myConvert <- function(my_data) {
  my_data %>%
    split(.$list_names) %>%
    map(~.$list_values)
}
```

This function works by first splitting the data frame into a list of data frames based on the `list_names` column. Then, it uses the `map` function from the `purrr` package (which is part of the `tidyverse`) to extract the `list_values` from each data frame in the list.

You can use this function on your data like this:

```r
my_data <- tibble(list_names = c("Ford", "Chevy", "Ford", "Dodge", "Dodge", "Ford"),
                  list_values = c("Ranger", "Equinox", "F150", "Caravan", "Ram", "Explorer"))

myConvert(my_data)
```

This will give you the desired output:

```r
$Chevy
[1] "Equinox"

$Dodge
[1] "Caravan" "Ram"    

$Ford
[1] "Ranger"   "F150"     "Explorer"
```
