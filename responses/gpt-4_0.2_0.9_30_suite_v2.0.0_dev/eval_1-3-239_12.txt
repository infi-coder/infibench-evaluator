Sure, here is a simple bash script that will install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink current python version
brew unlink python

# Install specific python version
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed python version
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that you need to replace `3.6` with the version number you want to install. This script will unlink the current version of Python, install the specific version you want, and then link that version.
