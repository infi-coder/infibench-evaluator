The `sourceMap` option in your `tsconfig.json` file is a compiler option. When it's set to `true`, the TypeScript compiler generates corresponding `.map` files for each `.js` file it outputs. These `.map` files are source maps, and they're used for debugging purposes.

Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. This is extremely useful when you're debugging your application in a browser, because it allows you to see and debug the original TypeScript code instead of the compiled JavaScript code.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the TypeScript compiler will not generate these `.map` files. This means that if you debug your application in a browser, you'll have to debug the compiled JavaScript code instead of the original TypeScript code. This can make debugging more difficult, especially if you're not familiar with JavaScript or if your TypeScript code makes heavy use of TypeScript-specific features.

In terms of the running application, there won't be any noticeable difference whether you have source maps enabled or not. They don't affect the performance or behavior of your application; they're purely a development and debugging aid.
