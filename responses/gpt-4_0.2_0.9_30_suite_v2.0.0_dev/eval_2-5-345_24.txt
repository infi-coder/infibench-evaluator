This error is caused by a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and Maven 3.8.5. IntelliJ IDEA's embedded Maven version is not compatible with Maven 3.8.5 which is used in Spring Boot 2.7. 

To resolve this issue, you can downgrade the Maven version to 3.8.4 or earlier in your project's `pom.xml` file. 

Here is how you can do it:

1. Open your `pom.xml` file.
2. Locate the `maven-wrapper-plugin` section.
3. Change the `maven` version to `3.8.4` or earlier.

Here is an example:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-wrapper-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.2</version>
    <configuration>
        <distributionUrl>https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.8.4/apache-maven-3.8.4-bin.zip</distributionUrl>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

After making these changes, re-import the project in IntelliJ IDEA.

Alternatively, you can wait for an update from IntelliJ IDEA that supports Maven 3.8.5.
