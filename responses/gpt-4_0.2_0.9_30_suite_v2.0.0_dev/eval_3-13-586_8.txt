The error message you're seeing is due to a change in Android 12 (API level 31) that requires you to specify whether a `PendingIntent` is mutable or immutable. 

The AndroidX Media library version 1.4.0, which you're using, should handle this requirement. However, it seems like there's a bug in the library that causes the error you're seeing.

The Android team is aware of this issue and it's tracked in the [Android issue tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/192358058). 

As a workaround, you can try to downgrade the target SDK version to 30 until the issue is resolved in the library. 

```groovy
android {
    compileSdkVersion 30
    defaultConfig {
        targetSdkVersion 30
    }
}
```

Remember to monitor the issue tracker and update your target SDK version once the issue is resolved. 

Please note that downgrading the target SDK version is a temporary workaround and might not be suitable for all use cases. Always make sure to test your app thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected.
