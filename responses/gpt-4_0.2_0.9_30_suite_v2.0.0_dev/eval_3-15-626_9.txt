Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed. 

Firstly, you are trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you haven't declared them. You should declare them using `Dim` keyword.

Secondly, you are trying to use `query` as a `WorkbookQuery` object, but you are assigning a string value to it. You should get the `WorkbookQuery` object from the `Workbook.Queries` collection.

Here is the corrected code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As WorkbookQuery
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Get the query from the workbook's Queries collection
    Set query = ThisWorkbook.Queries.Item(Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value)
    
    ' Get the current sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query.Name _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query.Name & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With
     
End Sub
```

This code assumes that the name of the query is stored in cell A1 of Sheet6. If you want to use the M code from the Power Query editor, you will need to use a different approach, as VBA does not support executing M code directly.
