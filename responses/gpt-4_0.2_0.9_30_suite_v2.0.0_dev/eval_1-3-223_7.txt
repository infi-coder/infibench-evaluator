You can use the `pkg_resources` module to get the installed version of a package, and the `yolk3k` package to get the latest version of a package from PyPI. Here is a function that does this:

```python
import pkg_resources
from yolk.pypi import CheeseShop

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    try:
        # Get installed version
        installed_version = pkg_resources.get_distribution(pkgName).version
    except pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:
        return False

    # Get latest version
    pypi = CheeseShop()
    versions = pypi.package_releases(pkgName)
    if not versions:  # No versions found on PyPI
        return False

    latest_version = versions[0]

    # Compare versions
    return installed_version == latest_version
```

This function will return `True` if the installed version of the package is the latest version, and `False` otherwise. If the package is not installed or not found on PyPI, it will also return `False`.

Please note that you need to install `yolk3k` package to use `CheeseShop`. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install yolk3k
```

Also, please note that this function assumes that the versions are always listed in descending order on PyPI, which is the current behavior but could potentially change in the future.
