The error message you're seeing is indicating that the response from your API call is not valid JSON. The character '<' is not a valid start of a JSON value.

The problem is likely due to the route configuration in your API controller. You have defined the route for your controller as `"[controller]"` and then for your `HttpGet` method as `"api/Employee/Index"`. This means that the full route to your method would be `"/Employee/api/Employee/Index"`.

To fix this, you should change your route configuration to match the route you're using in your Blazor application. Here's how you can do it:

```c#
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class EmployeeController : ControllerBase
{
    EmployeeRepository objemployee = new EmployeeRepository();

    [HttpGet]
    [Route("Index")]
    public IEnumerable<Employee> Index()
    {
        return objemployee.GetAllEmployees();
    }
}
```

Now, the route to your method should be `"/api/Employee/Index"`, which matches the route you're using in your Blazor application.

Also, please note that `GetJsonAsync` method is obsolete since .NET 5.0. You should use `GetFromJsonAsync` instead. Here's how you can do it:

```c#
empList = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<Employee[]>("/api/Employee/Index");
```

Remember to add `using System.Net.Http.Json;` at the top of your file to use `GetFromJsonAsync` method.
