Sure, here is a function that does exactly that:

```javascript
function keys_and_prices(raw_obj) {
    let keys = [];
    let prices = [];
    for (let key in raw_obj) {
        if (raw_obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
            keys.push(key);
            prices.push(raw_obj[key].price);
        }
    }
    return [keys, prices];
}
```

This function iterates over the keys in the `raw_obj` object, and for each key, it adds the key to the `keys` array and the corresponding price to the `prices` array. Finally, it returns an array containing the `keys` and `prices` arrays.

Please note that the order of keys and prices in the returned arrays depends on the order of properties in the original object, which is not guaranteed to be consistent across different JavaScript implementations. If you need the keys and prices to be in a specific order, you might need to sort the arrays after they are created.
