The error message `fork/exec /var/task/main: no such file or directory` is indicating that the AWS Lambda service is not able to find the executable file. This is likely because the binary was built on a Windows machine, and AWS Lambda runs on a Linux-based operating system.

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code for Linux. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Set the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to target Linux.
3. Build your Go application.

Here's the command you can use:

```bash
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -o main main.go
```

This will create a `main` binary that can run on a Linux operating system.

After that, you need to zip this `main` binary and upload it to AWS Lambda:

```bash
zip function.zip main
```

Then, upload `function.zip` to your AWS Lambda function. Make sure the handler name is set to `main`.

Now, your AWS Lambda function should be able to execute the Go code without any issues.
