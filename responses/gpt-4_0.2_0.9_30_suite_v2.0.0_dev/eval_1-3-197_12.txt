Here is a Python function that uses the `itertools.cycle` function to repeat the list of strings indefinitely. This function will fill the new column with the strings in the list in the same order, repeating the list as many times as necessary to fill all the rows.

```python
import pandas as pd
import itertools

def fillColumn(df, columnName, columnData):
    df[columnName] = list(itertools.islice(itertools.cycle(columnData), len(df)))
    return df
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
my_list = ['abc','def','hig']
df = fillColumn(df, 'names', my_list)
```

This will fill the 'names' column of the DataFrame `df` with the strings in `my_list`, repeating the list as many times as necessary to fill all the rows. The `itertools.islice` function is used to limit the number of elements taken from the infinite iterator created by `itertools.cycle` to the number of rows in the DataFrame.
