There could be several reasons why you're unable to start the Jupyter notebook on VS Code. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check your Python and IPyKernel versions**: Make sure you have a compatible version of Python and IPyKernel installed in your virtual environment. You can check the versions with the following commands:

    ```bash
    python --version
    pip show ipykernel
    ```

2. **Reinstall IPyKernel**: Sometimes, reinstalling IPyKernel can solve the issue. You can do this with the following commands:

    ```bash
    pip uninstall ipykernel
    pip install ipykernel
    ```

3. **Check your Python interpreter**: Make sure VS Code is using the correct Python interpreter. You can check this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of VS Code and selecting the correct interpreter.

4. **Check your Jupyter server**: Try starting a Jupyter server manually from your virtual environment to see if there are any issues. You can do this with the following command:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5. **Check your VS Code settings**: Make sure your VS Code settings are correct. You can check this by going to `File > Preferences > Settings` and searching for `Jupyter`.

6. **Check your VS Code extensions**: Make sure you have the latest versions of the Python and Jupyter extensions for VS Code. You can check this by going to `Extensions` and searching for `Python` and `Jupyter`.

7. **Check your conda environment**: Make sure your conda environment is activated and working correctly. You can check this with the following command:

    ```bash
    conda info --envs
    ```

If none of these steps solve your issue, it might be a bug with VS Code or one of its extensions. In that case, you should report the issue to the VS Code or extension developers.
