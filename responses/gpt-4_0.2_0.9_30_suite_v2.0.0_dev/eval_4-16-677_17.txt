The issue you're encountering is due to the use of single quotes around your variable `$searchT` in the `grep` command. Single quotes in bash will prevent variable expansion, meaning your variable is not being interpreted correctly.

Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(grep -wi "$searchT" test.txt) ]]; then     
    echo "$(grep -c "$searchT" test.txt) number of matches found"
    echo $(grep "$searchT" test.txt)
else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

I've made the following changes:

1. Replaced single quotes with double quotes around `$searchT` in the `grep` command.
2. Removed the `cat` command and passed the file directly to `grep`. This is a more efficient way to use `grep`.
3. Replaced `grep` and `wc -l` with `grep -c` to count the number of matches. This is a more efficient way to count matches.
