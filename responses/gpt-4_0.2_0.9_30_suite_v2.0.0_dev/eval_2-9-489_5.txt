The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. Without these security features, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. This file is typically located in the `/etc/elasticsearch` or `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory.

2. Add the following lines to the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save the `elasticsearch.yml` file and restart Elasticsearch.

Please note that enabling security will require you to set up passwords for the built-in users. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
```

This command will prompt you to enter passwords for the built-in users (`elastic`, `apm_system`, `kibana_system`, `logstash_system`, `beats_system`, and `remote_monitoring_user`).

After setting up the passwords, you'll need to update your application's Elasticsearch configuration to include the `elastic` user's password.

If you're running Elasticsearch using Docker, you can enable security by adding the following environment variables to your Docker command or Docker Compose file:

```yaml
- xpack.security.enabled=true
- xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled=true
```

And to set up the passwords, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
```

Remember to replace `<container_id>` with the ID of your Elasticsearch container.

Please note that enabling security might require additional configuration depending on your setup. For more information, you can refer to the [Elasticsearch security settings documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-settings.html).
