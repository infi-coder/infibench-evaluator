Sure, I understand your problem. The issue with your current code is that you're checking if the entire input string is within the `correct` string, not if each individual character is within `correct`. Here's a corrected version of your function:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)
```

This function uses the `all()` function, which returns `True` if all elements in the given iterable are true. The iterable in this case is a generator expression that checks if each character in `text` is in `correct`. If any character is not in `correct`, `all()` will return `False`. If all characters are in `correct`, `all()` will return `True`.

You can use this function like this:

```python
text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

This will print "Success" if all characters in the input are letters or digits, and "Failure" otherwise.
