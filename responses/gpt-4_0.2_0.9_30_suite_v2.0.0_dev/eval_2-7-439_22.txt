The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. You cannot install it via Composer. 

You need to install it via your PHP installation. The way to do this depends on your operating system.

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

**For CentOS / Fedora / RHEL:**

```bash
sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
```

**For MacOS (using Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install php@7.3
brew link --force --overwrite php@7.3
```

**For Windows:**

1. Find your `php.ini` file (you can check where it is by running `php --ini`).
2. Open it in a text editor.
3. Find the line `;extension=php_zip.dll` and remove the semicolon at the start of the line.
4. Save the `php.ini` file.
5. Restart your web server.

After installing the extension, you can check if it's enabled by running `php -m` in your terminal. If it's enabled, you should see `zip` in the list of modules.

Then, you can add it to your `composer.json` file like this:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1",
    "ext-zip": "*"
}
```

This won't install the extension, but it will prevent Composer from installing your project on a system where the extension is not installed.
