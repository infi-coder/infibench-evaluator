The issue here is that you're trying to use a `@Binding` in a place where you should be using `@State`. 

`@Binding` is used when you want to create a two-way connection between a view and its underlying model. In your case, you're trying to change the state of a view from within the same view, which is a perfect use case for `@State`.

Here's your corrected code:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isSelected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, `@State` is used instead of `@Binding` and `isSelected` is initialized with a default value of `false`.
