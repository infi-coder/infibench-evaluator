The error message is indicating that the `go_package` option is missing in your `.proto` file. This option is used to specify the package name for the generated Go code. 

You can fix this by adding a `go_package` option to your `.proto` file like this:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "main";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

In this case, the `go_package` is set to "main". You should replace "main" with whatever package name you want to use for the generated Go code.

After adding the `go_package` option, you should be able to generate the Go code with the `protoc` command you provided:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. simple.proto
```
