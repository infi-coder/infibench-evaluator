If the data you want to split into 5 separate columns is a string with a specific delimiter (like a comma, space, or tab), you can use the `Split` function in VBA. 

Assuming your data is separated by spaces, you can modify your code like this:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, " ") 'Assuming space is the delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code will split the `textline` into an array `splitData` and then assign each element of the array to a different column in the same row. Please adjust the delimiter and indices according to your data.
