If the data you want to split is separated by a specific character (like a comma, space, or tab), you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the string into an array, and then assign each element of the array to a different cell. Here's how you can do it:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, " ") ' Replace " " with your delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

Please replace `" "` in `Split(textline, " ")` with your actual delimiter. If your data is separated by a tab, you can use `vbTab` instead of `" "`. If it's separated by a comma, use `","`.
