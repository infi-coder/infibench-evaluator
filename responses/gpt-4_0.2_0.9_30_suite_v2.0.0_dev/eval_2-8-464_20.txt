The error you're encountering is due to the fact that AWS Lambda expects a Linux binary, but you're providing a Windows binary. When you build your Go application on Windows, it produces a Windows binary (main.exe), which is not compatible with the Linux environment in AWS Lambda.

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code for a Linux environment. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Set the environment variables for Linux and AMD64 architecture.
4. Build your Go application.

Here's the command you need to run:

```bash
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -o main main.go
```

This will produce a `main` binary file which is compatible with Linux. Now, you can zip this file and upload it to AWS Lambda.

```bash
zip function.zip main
```

Remember to set the handler name as `main` when you upload this zip file to AWS Lambda.

This should solve your issue. If you still encounter any problems, feel free to ask.
