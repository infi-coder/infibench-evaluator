The error message you're seeing is due to the way the command is being interpreted. It seems like there's an issue with the quotes in the command.

Here's a way to fix it:

1. Open the `mvn.cmd` file located at `C:\Program Files\NetBeans-11.1\netbeans\java\maven\bin\`.

2. Look for a line that starts with `set MAVEN_CMD_LINE_ARGS=`.

3. Replace that line with the following:

   ```cmd
   set "MAVEN_CMD_LINE_ARGS=%*"
   ```

4. Save the file and try to build your project again.

This change tells the command line to interpret the entire argument list as a single string, which should prevent the error you're seeing.
