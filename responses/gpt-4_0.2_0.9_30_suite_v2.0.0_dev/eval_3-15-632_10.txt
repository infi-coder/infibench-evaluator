Assuming your data is separated by a specific character (like a comma or a space), you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the string into an array and then assign each element of the array to a separate cell. Here's how you can do it:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, ",") ' replace "," with your separator
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code assumes that the line of text you're splitting contains exactly five elements. If the number of elements can vary, you'll need to add some error checking to prevent out-of-bounds errors.
