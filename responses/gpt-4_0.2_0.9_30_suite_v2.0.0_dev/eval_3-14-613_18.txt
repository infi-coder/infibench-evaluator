This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being associated with a target. Here's how you can fix it:

1. Open your SwiftUI file.
2. Click on the file name in the top center of Xcode.
3. In the right sidebar, under "Target Membership", make sure your app's target is checked.

If this doesn't work, try cleaning the build folder (Product -> Clean Build Folder) and restarting Xcode. 

If the issue persists, you might want to consider creating a new SwiftUI file and copying your code into it. Sometimes, Xcode can get confused with file references, especially when upgrading from older versions.
