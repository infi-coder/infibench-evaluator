The error you're seeing is because Python can't find your `app` module. This is likely because the `app` directory isn't being correctly copied into your Docker container.

Here's how you can revise your Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8

# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Add the current directory contents into the container at /app
ADD . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 8000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the command to start uvicorn
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

This Dockerfile will copy the entire current directory (which should include your `app` directory and `requirements.txt` file) into the `/app` directory in the container. Then it will install your Python dependencies and start the server.

Please make sure that your Dockerfile is in the root directory of your project (the same level as your `app` directory and `requirements.txt` file). If it's not, you'll need to adjust the paths in the `ADD` and `RUN` commands accordingly.

Also, please note that the `--reload` option is not recommended for production use. It is a convenient feature for development, but it can leak memory under heavy load.
