You should use the `.toast('show')` method to show the toast. Here is how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This code will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event, like a button click, you can use something like this:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function() {
  $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

This code will show the toast when a button with the id `myButton` is clicked.

Also, make sure you have included the Bootstrap JavaScript file in your HTML file, as the toast functionality relies on it. You can include it like this:

```html
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

This should be added before the closing `</body>` tag.
