Sure, here is a bash script that will install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current python version
brew unlink python

# Install the required python version
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed python version
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script assumes that you have Homebrew installed and that you have the necessary permissions to install software. 

Also, please note that the `--force` flag in the `brew link` command is necessary because Homebrew does not, by default, link keg-only packages like `python@3.6`. The `--force` flag overrides this behavior.
