The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal. If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires certain PHP extensions. You can check your installed extensions by running `php -m` in your terminal. Make sure you have all the required extensions installed. The required extensions are:

    - BCMath PHP Extension
    - Ctype PHP Extension
    - Fileinfo PHP extension
    - JSON PHP Extension
    - Mbstring PHP Extension
    - OpenSSL PHP Extension
    - PDO PHP Extension
    - Tokenizer PHP Extension
    - XML PHP Extension

3. **Check your Composer version**: Although you've updated Composer to 2.3.10, it's worth double-checking the version by running `composer --version` in your terminal.

4. **Clear Composer cache**: Sometimes, Composer cache might cause problems. You can clear it by running `composer clear-cache`.

5. **Try to install Laravel again**: After checking and making necessary updates, try to install Laravel again using the command you provided.

If you're still having trouble after following these steps, please provide more information about your PHP version, installed PHP extensions, and Composer version.
