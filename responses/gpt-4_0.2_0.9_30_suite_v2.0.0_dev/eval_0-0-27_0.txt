The issue you're facing might be due to a variety of reasons. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. The Apollo Client fetches data from the server, so a stable internet connection is required.

2. **Server Status**: Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can use tools like Postman or GraphQL Playground to test the server.

3. **CORS Policy**: If you're running the server locally, make sure it's configured to allow requests from the client's origin. This is a common issue that can cause requests to hang or fail.

4. **Query**: Ensure that the query you're sending is correct. In your case, the query seems fine if the server is set up to handle it.

5. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading or upgrading the version.

6. **React Native Version**: Ensure that your React Native version is compatible with the Apollo Client version you're using.

If none of the above solutions work, you can try to debug the issue by logging the error message. Modify your code as follows:

```javascript
const TestScreen = () => {
    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES);

    console.log(loading, error, data); 

    if (loading) return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
    if (error) {
        console.log(error.message);
        return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
    }

    return data.rates.map(({ currency, rate }) => (
        <View key={currency}>
            <Text>
                {currency}: {rate}
            </Text>
        </View>
    ));
};
```

This will print the error message to the console, which can provide more insight into what's going wrong.
