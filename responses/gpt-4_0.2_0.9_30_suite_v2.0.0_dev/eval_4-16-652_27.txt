AWS CLI uses a pager program to handle its output. By default, it uses the `less` program. The pager is activated when the output of a command is too long to fit in one screen. 

Starting from AWS CLI version 2, the output is paged by default. If you want to disable this behavior, you can do so by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. 

You can do this in your current shell session:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

Or you can add the above line to your shell's profile file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash) to make it permanent.

After setting `AWS_PAGER` to an empty string, the output of AWS CLI commands will be printed directly to the terminal, and you won't see the pager anymore.

So, your script would look like this:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""

for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will prevent the pager from being used, and the output will be directly printed to the terminal.
