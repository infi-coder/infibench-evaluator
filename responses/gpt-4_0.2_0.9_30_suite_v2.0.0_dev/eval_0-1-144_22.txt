You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This pseudo-element is responsible for the arrow.

Here is the CSS you can use:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may want to include vendor prefixes for older browsers */
    color: green;
}
```

This will change the color of the accordion arrow to green. 

However, Bootstrap 5 uses a background-image for the accordion arrow, so you might need to override it with your own image or use a Unicode character as an arrow. Here is an example:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    /* Unicode character for "up" arrow */
    content: '\25B2';
    color: green;
}

.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    /* Unicode character for "down" arrow */
    content: '\25BC';
    color: green;
}
```

In this example, the up arrow (`\25B2`) is shown when the accordion is open, and the down arrow (`\25BC`) is shown when it is closed. Both arrows are green.
