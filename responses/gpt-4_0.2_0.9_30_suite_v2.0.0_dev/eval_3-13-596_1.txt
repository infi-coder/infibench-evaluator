The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` is generated by the `bootJar` task of the Spring Boot Gradle plugin. It's a non-executable jar that doesn't include dependencies and can't be run with `java -jar`.

If you don't need it, you can disable the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will prevent the generation of the `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` file. However, be aware that this might affect other tasks or plugins that depend on the `bootJar` task.
