You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. This object is part of the Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library, so you need to set a reference to it in your VBA environment (Tools -> References -> Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library).

Here is a simple function to copy text to the clipboard:

```vba
Public Sub CopyToClipboard(s As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText s
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
End Sub
```

You can use it like this:

```vba
CopyToClipboard Me.NodeKey.Value
```

This will copy the value of `Me.NodeKey.Value` to the clipboard.
