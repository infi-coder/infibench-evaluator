Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a traditional RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command. Here's how:

1. Convert the OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for the passphrase (if any) of the key. After entering the passphrase, the key will be re-written in place in the RSA format. The `-p` option tells `ssh-keygen` to change the passphrase of a private key file, the `-m PEM` option specifies the output format and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file name of the private key.

2. Regarding the public key (`id_rsa.pub`), you don't need to convert it. The public key format is standard and doesn't have different formats like the private key. The server uses the public key to verify your identity, so as long as the private key you use to connect matches the public key on the server, you're good to go.
