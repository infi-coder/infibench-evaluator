Sure, you can create a function that checks if a year is a leap year or not. If it is a leap year, it returns 366, otherwise it returns 365. Here is the function:

```python
def DaysInYear(year):
    if (year % 4) == 0:
        if (year % 100) == 0:
            if (year % 400) == 0:
                return 366  # Leap year
            else:
                return 365  # Not a leap year
        else:
            return 366  # Leap year
    else:
        return 365  # Not a leap year
```

This function works by checking if the year is divisible by 4, which is the first condition for a year to be a leap year. If it is, it checks if the year is also divisible by 100. If it is, it needs to be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. If it is not divisible by 100, it is a leap year. If the year is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year.
