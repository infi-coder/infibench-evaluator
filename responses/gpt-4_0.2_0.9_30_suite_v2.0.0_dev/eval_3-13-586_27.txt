The error message you're seeing is due to a change in Android 12 (API level 31) which requires you to specify whether a `PendingIntent` is mutable or immutable. 

The `MediaSessionCompat` class in the AndroidX Media library creates a `PendingIntent` internally, and it seems like the version you're using (1.4.0) doesn't handle this change correctly.

As of November 2021, the AndroidX team has fixed this issue in version 1.5.0-alpha05 of the AndroidX Media library. You can try updating your library version to this or a later version.

In your `build.gradle` file, update the version of the media library:

```gradle
implementation 'androidx.media:media:1.5.0-alpha05'
```

Then sync your project with the Gradle files and try running your app again.

If you can't use an alpha version in your project, you might have to wait for a stable release that includes this fix.
