The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling zip archives. This is not a Composer package, so you cannot install it using `composer require`. 

You need to install it via your PHP installation. The method of installation depends on your operating system.

Here are the general steps for different operating systems:

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

**For CentOS/RHEL:**

```bash
sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
```

**For MacOS (using Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install php@7.3
brew link --overwrite --force php@7.3
pecl install zip
```

**For Windows:**

1. Download the ZIP extension from the PHP downloads page (make sure to choose the one that matches your PHP version and architecture).
2. Extract the file and put it in your PHP extensions directory.
3. Add `extension=php_zip.dll` to your `php.ini` file.

After installing the extension, you may need to restart your web server for the changes to take effect.

Then, in your `composer.json` file, you can add the following line to require the zip extension:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1",
    "ext-zip": "*"
}
```

This will not install the extension, but it will prevent Composer from installing your project unless the zip extension is present.
