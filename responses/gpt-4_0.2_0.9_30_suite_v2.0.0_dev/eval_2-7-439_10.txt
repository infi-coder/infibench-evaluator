The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling zip archives. It's not a Composer package, so you can't install it using `composer require`.

The error message you're seeing is because Composer is trying to find a package named `ext-zip`, but it doesn't exist.

If you're using a Unix-like operating system (like Ubuntu), you can install the `ext-zip` extension with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you're using Windows, you can enable the extension by uncommenting or adding the following line in your `php.ini` file:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing or enabling the `ext-zip` extension, you may need to restart your web server for the changes to take effect.

If you're using PHPStorm, you may also need to configure it to use the correct PHP interpreter. You can do this by going to `File > Settings > Languages & Frameworks > PHP` and selecting the correct interpreter from the `CLI Interpreter` dropdown.

Finally, if you're using Composer, you may need to add `ext-zip` to the `require` section of your `composer.json` file to tell Composer that your project depends on the `ext-zip` extension. Here's an example:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1.3",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer install` to check if everything is set up correctly.
