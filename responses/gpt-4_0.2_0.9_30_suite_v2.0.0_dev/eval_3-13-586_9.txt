The error message you're seeing is due to a change in Android 12 (API level 31) that requires you to specify either `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` or `FLAG_MUTABLE` when creating a `PendingIntent`.

The `MediaSessionCompat` class in the AndroidX Media library creates a `PendingIntent` internally, and it seems like the version you're using (1.4.0) doesn't set these flags correctly.

This issue has been fixed in version 1.4.3 of the AndroidX Media library. So, you should update your dependency to use the latest version.

In your `build.gradle` file, update the version of the AndroidX Media library:

```gradle
implementation 'androidx.media:media:1.4.3'
```

After updating the library, clean and rebuild your project. This should resolve the issue.
