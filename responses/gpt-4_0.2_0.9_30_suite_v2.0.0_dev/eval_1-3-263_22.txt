The `f` before the string in the `print` function is used to create what's known as an f-string (formatted string literal) in Python. It was introduced in Python 3.6.

F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting. 

Here's how it works:

- You write an `f` before the string.
- Inside this string, you can write a variable name or an expression in curly braces `{}`.
- The variable or expression in the curly braces is evaluated and its value is inserted into the string.

In your example:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

`args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` are expressions. The f-string will replace `{args.input_directory}` with the value of `args.input_directory`, and `{args.output_directory}` with the value of `args.output_directory`.

So, if `args.input_directory` is `/home/user/input` and `args.output_directory` is `/home/user/output`, the printed output will be:

```
Input directory: /home/user/input
Output directory: /home/user/output
```
