The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package, so you can't install it using Composer. 

The error message you're seeing is because Composer is trying to find a package named `ext-zip`, but it doesn't exist.

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to install it via your PHP installation.

If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can install it via the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

Or if you're using PHP 7.2, for example:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php7.2-zip
```

If you're using Windows, you can enable the extension in your `php.ini` file:

1. Open your `php.ini` file in a text editor.
2. Find the line that looks like `;extension=php_zip.dll`.
3. Remove the semicolon at the start of the line to enable the extension.
4. Save and close the `php.ini` file.
5. Restart your web server.

After installing the extension, you can tell Composer that it's installed by adding it to the `require` section of your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer update` to update your project's dependencies.
