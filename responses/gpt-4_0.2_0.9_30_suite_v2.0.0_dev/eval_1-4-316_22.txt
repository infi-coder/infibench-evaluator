The error you're getting is because the `sort` function in R doesn't work directly on lists. However, you can use the `unlist` function to convert the list back to a vector, sort it, and then convert it back to a list if necessary.

Here is the function you asked for:

```r
mySort <- function(l) {
  # Unlist the list to a vector
  unlisted_data <- unlist(l)
  
  # Sort the vector
  sorted_data <- sort(unlisted_data)
  
  # Convert back to list and return
  sorted_list <- as.list(sorted_data)
  
  return(sorted_list)
}
```

You can use this function to sort your list as follows:

```r
sorted_list = mySort(list_text_data)
```

This will return a list of the same letters, but sorted alphabetically.
