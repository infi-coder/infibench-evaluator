The error `bad CPU type in executable` usually happens when you're trying to run an application that is not compatible with the architecture of your CPU. In your case, the version of `pdftk` you're trying to use is probably not compatible with your Mac's CPU.

Since macOS Catalina, Apple has removed support for 32-bit applications. If the version of `pdftk` you're trying to use is 32-bit, it will not work on Catalina or later versions of macOS.

Here are some steps to solve this issue:

1. **Use Homebrew to install pdftk-java:**

    `pdftk-java` is a reimplementation of `pdftk` in Java, which should work on your Mac. You can install it using Homebrew.

    If you haven't installed Homebrew yet, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

    Then, you can install `pdftk-java` by running:

    ```bash
    brew install pdftk-java
    ```

2. **Create a symbolic link to pdftk-java:**

    After installing `pdftk-java`, you can create a symbolic link to it with the name `pdftk` so that you can use it just like you would use `pdftk`.

    You can create the symbolic link by running:

    ```bash
    ln -s /usr/local/bin/pdftk /usr/local/bin/pdftk-java
    ```

    Now, you should be able to use `pdftk` as usual.
