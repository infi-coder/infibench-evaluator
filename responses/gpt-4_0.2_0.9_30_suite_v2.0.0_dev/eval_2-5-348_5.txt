This error is caused by a known issue in Java versions 1.8.0_191 and later, where the handling of quotes in command line arguments has been changed. This issue affects NetBeans when it tries to run Maven commands.

There are a few ways to solve this problem:

1. **Downgrade your Java version**: You can downgrade to a Java version before 1.8.0_191. This is not recommended because you will miss out on the latest features and security fixes.

2. **Upgrade NetBeans**: Upgrade to a newer version of NetBeans that has fixed this issue. As of NetBeans 11.3, this issue has been fixed.

3. **Change the NetBeans configuration**: You can change the NetBeans configuration to use a different method to run Maven commands that doesn't have this issue.

   To do this, open the `netbeans.conf` file in the `etc` directory of your NetBeans installation. Add the following line to the file:

   ```
   netbeans_default_options="-J-Djdk.lang.Process.allowAmbiguousCommands=true"
   ```

   This will tell Java to use the old method of handling quotes in command line arguments.

After making these changes, you should be able to build your project without encountering this error.
