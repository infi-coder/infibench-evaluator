Font Awesome 5 has made some changes in the way it's used compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is no longer just "FontAwesome", but is specific to the style of icon you're using. 

Here's how you can update your CSS for Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* Update this line */
  font-weight: 900; /* Add this line */
}
```

In Font Awesome 5, the `font-family` can be one of the following, depending on the style of icon you're using:

- "Font Awesome 5 Free" for solid, regular, or brands style.
- "Font Awesome 5 Pro" for light or duotone style (Pro subscription required).

Also, you need to specify the `font-weight`:

- `font-weight: 900;` for solid style.
- `font-weight: 400;` for regular or brands style.
- `font-weight: 300;` for light style (Pro subscription required).
- `font-weight: 200;` or `font-weight: 900;` for duotone style (Pro subscription required).

In your case, you're using the solid style (as indicated by the unicode `\f107` which is the "angle-down" icon in solid style), so you should use "Font Awesome 5 Free" as the `font-family` and `900` as the `font-weight`.
