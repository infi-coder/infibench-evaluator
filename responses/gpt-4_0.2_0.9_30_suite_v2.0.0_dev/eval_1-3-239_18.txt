Sure, here is a bash script to install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current python version
brew unlink python

# Install the required python version
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed python version
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will unlink the current version of Python you have installed. If you have Python 2.x installed, it will not be affected. Also, you may need to add the newly installed Python to your PATH.
