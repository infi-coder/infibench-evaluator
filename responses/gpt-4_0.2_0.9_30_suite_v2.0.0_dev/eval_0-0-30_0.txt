Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17 that you can use. It's called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. Here is how you can adapt your code:

First, install the adapter:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can use it in your code like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Please note that this is an unofficial package, so it might not be as stable or reliable as the official ones. However, it's currently the best option available for testing React 17 apps with Enzyme.
