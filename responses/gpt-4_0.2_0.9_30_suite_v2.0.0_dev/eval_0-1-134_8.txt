It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by Emmet, a plugin for many text editors that helps to quickly generate HTML and CSS code using abbreviations. The `.classname` abbreviation automatically generates a `div` with the class `classname` when you press `Tab`.

For example, if you type `.myClass` and then press `Tab`, it will automatically expand to `<div class="myClass"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, it could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Emmet is not installed or enabled in your text editor.** Check your text editor's documentation or settings to see if Emmet is available and enabled. If you're using an editor like VS Code, Emmet is built-in and enabled by default.

2. **You're not using the correct syntax.** Make sure you're typing the class name immediately after the period, with no spaces (e.g., `.myClass`), and then pressing `Tab`.

3. **There's a conflict with another plugin or setting in your text editor.** If you have other plugins installed, they might interfere with Emmet. Try disabling other plugins to see if that fixes the problem.

4. **Your file is not saved with a .html extension.** Emmet works based on the type of file you're editing. Make sure your file is saved with the correct extension (e.g., `index.html`).

If you've checked all of these and it's still not working, you might want to look for specific troubleshooting information for your text editor.
