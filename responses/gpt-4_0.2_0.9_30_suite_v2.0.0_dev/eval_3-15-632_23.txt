If you want to split the line into 5 separate columns, you can use the `Split` function in VBA. This function splits a string into a one-dimensional array, based on a delimiter. 

Assuming that your data is separated by a space, you can modify your code as follows:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, " ") 'Assuming space is the delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

Please replace `" "` with your actual delimiter if it's not a space. Also, ensure that each line of your text file contains at least 5 elements, otherwise you may encounter an "out of range" error.
