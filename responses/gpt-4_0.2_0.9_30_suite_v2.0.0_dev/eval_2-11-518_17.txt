The Rule of Five is not outdated, but its usage has been reduced due to the advent of smart pointers in C++11 and later. 

Smart pointers (like `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, etc.) indeed manage resources well and can eliminate the need for user-defined destructors, copy constructors, copy assignment operators, move constructors, and move assignment operators in many cases. 

However, there are still situations where the Rule of Five applies:

1. **Performance considerations**: Sometimes, for performance reasons, you might want to manage memory in a specific way that's not covered by the standard smart pointers. In such cases, you'll need to implement your own constructors, destructor, and assignment operators.

2. **Non-memory resources**: The Rule of Five is not only about memory management. It also applies to any kind of resource that needs to be managed, like file handles, network sockets, database connections, etc. Smart pointers can't help with these.

3. **Legacy code**: If you're working with older code that doesn't use smart pointers, you'll need to follow the Rule of Five.

4. **Custom behavior**: If you need custom copy/move semantics, you'll need to implement these functions yourself.

So, while smart pointers have reduced the need for the Rule of Five, they haven't eliminated it. It's still an important concept in C++ that every C++ programmer should understand.
