Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a traditional RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` tool. Here is the command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command does the following:

- `-p` allows you to change the passphrase of a private key file.
- `-m PEM` specifies the format of the key file. PEM is the traditional format and it will start with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.
- `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file of the private key.

After running this command, your `id_rsa` file will be in the traditional RSA private key format.

As for your second question, you do not need to convert your public key. The public key file (`id_rsa.pub`) does not have a header like the private key, and it can be used with both OpenSSH and traditional RSA private keys. The server only needs your public key to authenticate you, and it does not matter whether your private key is in OpenSSH or traditional RSA format.
