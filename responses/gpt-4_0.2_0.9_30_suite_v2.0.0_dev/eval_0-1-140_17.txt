Font Awesome 5 has made some changes to how it's used compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is no longer just "FontAwesome", it's now separated into different styles: "Font Awesome 5 Free", "Font Awesome 5 Brands", and "Font Awesome 5 Pro". The content codes have also changed.

Here's how you can update your CSS for Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f105";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

In this example, I've used the `font-family` "Font Awesome 5 Free" and the `font-weight` 900 because the arrow you're trying to use is in the solid style set. The content code for the arrow has also changed to "\f105". 

Remember to include the correct Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.13/css/all.css">
```

This link includes all styles: solid, regular, and brands. If you're using the Pro version, make sure to include the Pro CSS file instead.
