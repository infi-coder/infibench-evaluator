## CSRF Token Mismatch

The CSRF token mismatch issue could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Make sure your domain is correctly configured. If you have a `www` in your domain name, make sure you are accessing your site with `www`. If not, the session will not be recognized and a new one will be created.

2. **Cookie Configuration**: Check your `config/session.php` file and make sure the `domain` and `path` are correctly set. The `domain` should match your domain and the `path` should be `/`.

3. **Middleware**: Ensure that the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is included in your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

4. **HTTPS**: If your site is served over HTTPS, make sure your `config/session.php` file has `secure` set to `true`.

5. **Session Driver**: If you are using a different session driver, make sure it is correctly configured and working properly.

## SMTP Email Sending

The error you're getting is related to the SSL version used by the SMTP server. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Change Encryption**: Try changing `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` from `ssl` to `tls` in your `.env` file. Some servers use `tls` instead of `ssl`.

2. **Change Port**: Try changing `MAIL_PORT` from `587` to `465` in your `.env` file. Port `465` is usually used with `ssl` and port `587` is usually used with `tls`.

3. **Check SSL Version**: Check with your hosting provider or the email service provider to see which SSL version they are using. You might need to specify the SSL version in your mail configuration.

4. **Disable SSL Verification**: As a last resort, you can try disabling SSL verification. This is not recommended for production environments as it can make your application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. You can disable SSL verification by adding the following code to your `mail.php` configuration file:

```php
'stream' => [
    'ssl' => [
        'allow_self_signed' => true,
        'verify_peer' => false,
        'verify_peer_name' => false,
    ],
],
```

Remember to clear your configuration cache by running `php artisan config:clear` after making changes to your `.
