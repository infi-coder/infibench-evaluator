You can use `awk` to extract the language code. Here is a modified version of your command:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | head -1 | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'
```

Here is what the command does:

- `curl -Ls stick-it.app` fetches the content of the page.
- `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'` extracts the `lang` attribute. The `-o` option tells `grep` to only output the matched string.
- `head -1` takes the first match.
- `awk -F'"' '{print $2}'` splits the string by `"` and prints the second field, which is the language code.

This command should work for any page and any language code.
