You should use `@Configuration` when you want to define beans explicitly in your application. It is typically used in situations where you need to instantiate, configure and wire together multiple related beans. 

On the other hand, `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Component` are stereotypes used for auto-detection of components. They are typically used when you want Spring to automatically manage your beans. 

- `@Service`: Used in the service layer.
- `@Controller`: Used in the presentation layer (Spring MVC).
- `@Component`: A generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.

In summary, use `@Configuration` for explicit definition and management of beans, and use `@Service/@Controller/@Component` for automatic management of beans.
