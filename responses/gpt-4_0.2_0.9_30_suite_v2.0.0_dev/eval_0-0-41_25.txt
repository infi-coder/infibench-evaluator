The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method is asynchronous and takes two callback functions as arguments. The first callback is executed when the location is successfully retrieved, and the second one is executed when there is an error.

In your case, you are only providing the success callback. You should also provide the error callback to handle the case when the user does not allow location access. Here is how you can do it:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the user does not allow location access, the error callback will be executed and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console. If the browser does not support geolocation at all, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged to the console.
