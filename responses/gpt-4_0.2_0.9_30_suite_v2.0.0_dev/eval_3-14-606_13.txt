It seems like there's a misunderstanding. iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" that you can enable or disable like Android. However, if you're trying to install a provisioned testing build, you need to have the device's UDID registered with your Apple Developer account and the app properly signed.

Here are the steps to install a provisioned testing build:

1. **Register your device's UDID with your Apple Developer account.**
    - Connect your device to your Mac.
    - Open Xcode.
    - Go to Window > Devices and Simulators.
    - Select your device from the list on the left.
    - Copy the Identifier (UDID) value.
    - Go to the Apple Developer website, navigate to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles, and register your device's UDID.

2. **Sign your app with the correct provisioning profile.**
    - In Xcode, go to your Target settings > General.
    - In the Signing section, make sure your Apple Developer account is selected and the correct provisioning profile is used.

3. **Build and install your app.**
    - Connect your device to your Mac.
    - In Xcode, select your device as the build target.
    - Build and run your app.

If you're still having trouble, the issue might be with the app itself, not with your device or developer account. Make sure the app is correctly configured for development and try again.
