Sure, here is a revised version of your function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        pig_latin_word = word[1:] + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
        pig_latin_words.append(pig_latin_word)
    return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)
```

In this revised function, the words are split and processed one by one. The first character of each word is moved to the end, and 'ay' is appended. The processed words are then joined back together with spaces in between.
