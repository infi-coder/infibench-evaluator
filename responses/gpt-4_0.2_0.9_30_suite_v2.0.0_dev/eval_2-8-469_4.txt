The error message is indicating that the `go_package` option is missing in your `.proto` file. This option is used to specify the full Go package import path. 

You can fix this by adding `option go_package = "<your-package-path>";` to your `.proto` file. Replace `<your-package-path>` with the import path of your Go package.

Here is how your `.proto` file should look like:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "github.com/yourusername/yourreponame/yourpackage"; // replace with your package path

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

After adding the `go_package` option, you should be able to generate the Go code using the `protoc` command you provided.
