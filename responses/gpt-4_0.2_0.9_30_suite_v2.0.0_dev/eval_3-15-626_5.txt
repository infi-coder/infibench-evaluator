Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues. 

Firstly, you are trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you didn't declare them. 

Secondly, you are trying to use `query.Name` but `query` is just a string value from a cell, it doesn't have a `Name` property.

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Get the query from the cell
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Get the current sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Add a new ListObject with a QueryTable that uses the Power Query connection string
    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code will create a new QueryTable in the "target" sheet that uses the Power Query connection string. The query text is taken from cell A1 in Sheet6. 

Please note that this code assumes that the query text in cell A1 is a valid Power Query query and that the "target" sheet exists.
