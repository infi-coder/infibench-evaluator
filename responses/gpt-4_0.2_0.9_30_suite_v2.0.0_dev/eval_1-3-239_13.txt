Sure, here is a bash script that you can use to install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current version of Python
brew unlink python

# Install the required version
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed version
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that you need to have Homebrew installed on your macOS. Also, this script needs to be run with administrative privileges.
