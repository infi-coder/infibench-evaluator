The error you're seeing is because AWS Lambda expects a Linux binary, but you're providing a Windows binary. When you run `go build main.go` on a Windows machine, it creates a Windows binary (main.exe). 

To create a Linux binary from a Windows machine, you need to set the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to target Linux. 

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Set the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to target Linux:

```bash
set GOOS=linux
set GOARCH=amd64
```

3. Build your Go application:

```bash
go build -o main main.go
```

This will create a Linux binary named `main`.

4. Zip the binary:

```bash
zip deployment.zip main
```

5. Upload `deployment.zip` to AWS Lambda.

Remember to set the handler name to `main` (the name of your binary) when you upload the zip file to AWS Lambda.

Try these steps and let me know if you still face any issues.
