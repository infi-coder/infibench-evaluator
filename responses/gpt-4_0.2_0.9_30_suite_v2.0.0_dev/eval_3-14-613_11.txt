This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being linked to the correct target. Here's how you can check and fix this:

1. Open the file that contains your `ContentView_Previews`.
2. In the File Inspector (the first tab in the right sidebar), under "Target Membership", make sure your app's target is checked.

If your app's target is not checked, the SwiftUI Preview might not be able to find the correct target to run the preview, leading to the error you're seeing. 

If this doesn't solve your issue, try cleaning the build folder (Product > Clean Build Folder) and restarting Xcode. 

If the problem persists, it might be a bug in Xcode 12.3. You could try updating to a newer version of Xcode if available.
