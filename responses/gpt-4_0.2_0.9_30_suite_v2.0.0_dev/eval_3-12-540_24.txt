Yes, in Flutter you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw vertical lines between components. The `VerticalDivider` is a widget that displays a vertical line with a customizable height and color.

Here is a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 2'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 3'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, `VerticalDivider` widgets are placed between `Text` widgets inside a `Row` widget. The `color`, `thickness`, and `width` properties of the `VerticalDivider` can be customized. The `Expanded` widget is used to give equal space to each `Text` widget in the `Row`.

Please note that `VerticalDivider` is only visible when used within a `Row` widget. If you want to use it in a `Column` widget, you might want to consider using the `Divider` widget instead.
