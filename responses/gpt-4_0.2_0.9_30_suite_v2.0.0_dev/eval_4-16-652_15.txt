AWS CLI version 2 introduced automatic paging for commands that return multiple pages of output. However, this feature can be disabled in a few ways:

1. **Per command basis**: You can disable the pager for a single command by redirecting the output to `stdout` like so:

    ```bash
    aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > /dev/null
    ```

2. **Environment variable**: You can disable the pager for all commands in the current shell session by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string:

    ```bash
    export AWS_PAGER=""
    ```

3. **AWS CLI configuration**: You can disable the pager for all commands for the current user by setting the `cli_pager` option to an empty string in the AWS CLI configuration file (`~/.aws/config`):

    ```bash
    [default]
    cli_pager=
    ```

4. **AWS CLI configuration (per profile)**: You can disable the pager for all commands for a specific profile by setting the `cli_pager` option to an empty string in the AWS CLI configuration file under the profile section:

    ```bash
    [profile myprofile]
    cli_pager=
    ```

In your case, you can modify your script like this:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""

for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will disable the pager for all commands in the script.
