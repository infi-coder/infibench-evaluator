The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`. It is part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

You need to install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational` package to your project to use the `[Keyless]` attribute. You can do this by using the NuGet package manager or by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```shell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational
```

After installing the package, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute by adding the following using statement to your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Then you can use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class like this:

```csharp
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    // Other properties...
}
```

And in your `DbContext`:

```csharp
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

You can then use the `FromSqlRaw` method as you described:

```csharp
_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)
```
