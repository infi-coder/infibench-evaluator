The error you're seeing is typically caused by the response from the server not being a valid JSON string. This can happen if the server is returning an error message, or if there's some other unexpected response.

Here are a few things you can try to debug and solve this issue:

1. **Print the response body**: Before you try to decode the response, print it out to see what you're actually getting. This can help you understand if the response is valid JSON or not.

```dart
print('Response body: ${response.body}');
```

2. **Check the response status code**: Before decoding the response, check the HTTP status code. If it's not 200, there was some kind of error.

```dart
if (response.statusCode == 200) {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} else {
  print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}.');
}
```

3. **Check your server-side code**: Make sure that your PHP script is correctly outputting a JSON response. You can test this by making a request to your script from a tool like Postman or curl.

4. **Catch the FormatException**: You can catch the `FormatException` to prevent it from crashing your app, and print out an error message.

```dart
try {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} catch (e) {
  print('Error: $e');
}
```

Remember, the `json.decode` function expects a string that is a valid JSON. If it receives anything else, it will throw a `FormatException`.
