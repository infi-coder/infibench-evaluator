The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are the steps you should follow to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal. If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions: `BCMath`, `Ctype`, `Fileinfo`, `JSON`, `Mbstring`, `OpenSSL`, `PDO`, `Tokenizer`, and `XML`. You can check your installed extensions by running `php -m` in your terminal. If any of these extensions are missing, you'll need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Although you've mentioned that you've updated Composer to version 2.3.10, it's worth double-checking. You can check your Composer version by running `composer --version` in your terminal.

If all the above requirements are met and you're still facing the issue, it might be due to Laravel 9 not being available yet. As of the time of writing this response, Laravel 9 has not been officially released and the latest stable version is Laravel 8. You can check the latest version of Laravel on the [official Laravel GitHub page](https://github.com/laravel/laravel). 

You can install the latest stable version of Laravel by running:

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog
```

This command will create a new Laravel project in a directory named `blog`.
