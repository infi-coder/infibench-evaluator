The error message is indicating that you're trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`), which is not allowed. Navigation properties are used to establish relationships between entities, they are not scalar properties that can be indexed.

If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property, you should do it like this:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);` is creating an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity, which is a scalar property and can be indexed.
