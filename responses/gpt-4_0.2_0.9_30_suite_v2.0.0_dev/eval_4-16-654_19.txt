You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by using the `ssh-add` command. Before that, you need to start the ssh-agent in the background.

Here are the steps:

1. Start Git Bash.
2. Start the ssh-agent in the background:

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
```

3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```bash
ssh-add /d/keys/your_key
```

Replace `your_key` with the name of your private key file.

If you generated your SSH key with PuttyGen, make sure you have converted it to the OpenSSH format. If you haven't done this, you can do it using PuttyGen: Load your private key, then go to `Conversions > Export OpenSSH key` and save your key in OpenSSH format. Then you can add this key to the ssh-agent as described above.
