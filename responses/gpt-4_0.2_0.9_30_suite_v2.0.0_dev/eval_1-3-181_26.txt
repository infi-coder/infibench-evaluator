Sure, you can use the numpy's `max` function along with the appropriate axis to get the maximum value of the third column from each 2D array in your 3D array. Here is the function `getMax`:

```python
import numpy as np

def getMax(matrix):
    return np.max(matrix[:,:,2], axis=1).reshape(-1,1)
```

This function works as follows:

- `matrix[:,:,2]` selects the third column from each 2D array in the 3D array.
- `np.max(..., axis=1)` computes the maximum value along the rows for each 2D array.
- `.reshape(-1,1)` reshapes the result into a 2D array with one column.

You can use this function with your 3D array to get the desired result.
