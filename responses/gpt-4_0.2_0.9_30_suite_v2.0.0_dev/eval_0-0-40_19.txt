It seems like you have two installations of Node.js: one in your WSL2 Ubuntu and the other in your Windows system. The `npm` command is trying to use the Windows installation, which is causing the error.

You can solve this issue by adding the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
```

This line will prioritize the Ubuntu's `/usr/bin` directory over Windows's directories. After adding the line, you need to source the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

or 

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Then, you can check the versions of `node` and `npm` again:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

You should now see the correct versions of `node` and `npm` that you installed in your Ubuntu system.
