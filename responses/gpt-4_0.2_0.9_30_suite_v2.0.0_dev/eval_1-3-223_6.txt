You can use the `pkg_resources` module to get the installed version of a package, and the `yolk3k` module to get the latest version available on PyPI. Here is a function that does this:

```python
import pkg_resources
from yolk.pip import Pip
from yolk.metadata import Metadata

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get installed version
    installed_version = pkg_resources.get_distribution(pkgName).version

    # Get latest version
    pip = Pip.from_path()
    metadata = Metadata.from_package(pkgName)
    latest_version = metadata.version

    # Compare and return
    return installed_version == latest_version
```

This function will return `True` if the installed version of the package is the latest, and `False` otherwise.

Please note that `yolk3k` is not a built-in Python module and you need to install it using pip:

```bash
pip install yolk3k
```

Also, this function assumes that the package is already installed. If the package is not installed, `pkg_resources.get_distribution(pkgName).version` will raise a `DistributionNotFound` exception. You may want to add error handling for this case.
