Sure, here is a Python function that generates a random 16-character string that includes the substring "NAA3U" and exactly 3 digits:

```python
import random
import string

def generateRandomString():
    # Define the characters to use
    chars = string.ascii_letters  # a-z and A-Z

    # Generate two random strings of letters
    part1 = ''.join(random.choice(chars) for _ in range(5))
    part2 = ''.join(random.choice(chars) for _ in range(3))

    # Generate a random digit
    digit1 = str(random.randint(0, 9))
    digit2 = str(random.randint(0, 9))

    # Combine the parts into the final string
    final_string = part1 + "NAA3U" + digit1 + part2 + digit2

    return final_string
```

This function first generates two random strings of letters, each of length 5 and 3 respectively. It then generates two random digits. It combines these parts into the final string, ensuring that the substring "NAA3U" is included and that there are exactly 3 digits.

Please note that the position of "NAA3U" and the digits are fixed in this implementation. If you want them to appear at random positions, you may need a more complex algorithm.
