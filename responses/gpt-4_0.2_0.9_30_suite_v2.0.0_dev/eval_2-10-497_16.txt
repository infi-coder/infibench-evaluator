In Rust, the `Box<T>` type is a smart pointer that points to data on the heap. Unlike raw pointers in C or C++, `Box<T>` is guaranteed to point to a valid object, or in other words, it can't be null. This is one of the ways Rust ensures memory safety.

However, you can use `Option<Box<T>>` to represent a nullable `Box<T>`. The `Option<T>` type is an enum that can be either `Some(T)` or `None`, where `None` represents the absence of a value.

Here's how you can modify your `Node` and `Stack` structs to use `Option<Box<Node>>`:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

Now, you can check if `top` is `None` (or "null") like this:

```rust
if let Some(node) = &stack.top {
    // `top` is not null, do something with `node`
} else {
    // `top` is null
}
```

Or like this:

```rust
match &stack.top {
    Some(node) => {
        // `top` is not null, do something with `node`
    },
    None => {
        // `top` is null
    }
}
```

Or even like this:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    // `top` is null
}
```

Remember, in Rust, you usually don't need to deal with null pointers thanks to the type system and the `Option<T>` type.
