The error message you're seeing is likely due to ESLint not being able to find your `tsconfig.json` file. In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you've specified the `project` option under `parserOptions` as `"tsconfig.json"`, which means ESLint will look for this file in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file.

If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, you'll need to provide the correct relative path. For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would need to change the `project` option to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

Here's how you can modify your `.eslintrc.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "./tsconfig.json", // or the correct relative path to your tsconfig.json file
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  // ...
};
```

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file and you're still seeing this error, there might be an issue with your ESLint or TypeScript configurations. In this case, you might want to try reinstalling these packages or creating a new project with the Firebase CLI to see if the issue persists.
