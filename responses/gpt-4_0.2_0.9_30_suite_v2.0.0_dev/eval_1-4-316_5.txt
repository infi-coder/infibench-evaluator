You can sort a list in R using the `sort()` function. However, the `sort()` function doesn't work directly on lists of lists. In your case, `list_text_data` is a list of lists, where each list contains a single character. 

To sort this list, you can first unlist it, sort the result, and then convert it back to a list. Here is a function `mySort` that does this:

```r
mySort <- function(l) {
  # Unlist the list
  unlisted_data <- unlist(l)
  
  # Sort the unlisted data
  sorted_data <- sort(unlisted_data)
  
  # Convert back to list
  sorted_list <- as.list(sorted_data)
  
  return(sorted_list)
}
```

You can use this function to sort your list as follows:

```r
sorted_list_text_data <- mySort(list_text_data)
```

This will give you a sorted list of characters.
