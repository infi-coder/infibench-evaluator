The problem you're encountering is due to the fact that your system is trying to use the Windows version of npm, which is not compatible with the Linux subsystem. 

To solve this issue, you need to adjust your PATH environment variable to prioritize the Linux version of npm over the Windows version.

You can do this by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
```

This line will ensure that your system looks for executables in `/usr/bin` (where the Linux version of npm is located) before it looks in other directories.

After adding this line, you need to source your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file to apply the changes. You can do this by running one of the following commands:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

or

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, when you run `npm -v`, you should see the version of npm that was installed with apt-get, and you should be able to use npm without encountering the "bad interpreter" error.
