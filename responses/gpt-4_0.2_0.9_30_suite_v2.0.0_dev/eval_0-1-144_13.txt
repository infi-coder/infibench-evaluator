You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This pseudo-element is responsible for the arrow. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may need to override bootstrap color */
    color: green !important;
}
```

Please note that the `!important` rule is used to override the existing styles that might have been defined in the Bootstrap CSS. It's generally not recommended to use `!important` as it can make debugging more difficult in the future, but in some cases (like when you need to override third-party CSS) it can be necessary.

Also, remember to include this CSS after the Bootstrap CSS file, so it can override the default styles. If you include it before, Bootstrap's styles will take precedence.
