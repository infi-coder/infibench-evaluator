Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. You are trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you haven't declared them. You need to declare them using the `Dim` keyword.

2. You are trying to use `query` as an object, but you are assigning it a string value. You need to create a `WorkbookQuery` object.

3. You are using `query.Name` in your connection string, but `query` is a string, not an object, so it doesn't have a `Name` property.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Get the query from the cell
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Get the current sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Create a new ListObject with a QueryTable
    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code will create a new `ListObject` with a `QueryTable` in the current sheet, using the query from cell A1 in Sheet6. The results of the query will be loaded into the range starting at cell A1 in the "target" sheet.
