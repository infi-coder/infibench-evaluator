You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by using the `ssh-add` command. However, before you do that, you need to start the ssh-agent in the background.

Here are the steps:

1. Start Git Bash.
2. Start the ssh-agent in the background:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace `id_rsa` in the command with the name of your private key file.

```bash
ssh-add D:/keys/id_rsa
```

Now your SSH key has been added to Git Bash and you should be able to clone your repository.

Please note that the key must be in OpenSSH format, not in PuTTY's PPK format. If your key is in PPK format, you can convert it to OpenSSH format using PuTTYgen:

1. Open PuTTYgen.
2. Click 'Load' and select your .ppk private key.
3. Once the key is loaded, go to 'Conversions' from the PuTTYgen menu and select 'Export OpenSSH key'.
4. Save your new OpenSSH key when prompted.
