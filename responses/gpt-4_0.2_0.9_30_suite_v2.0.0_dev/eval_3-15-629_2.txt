You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. Here's a simple function to copy text to the clipboard in VBA:

```vba
Sub CopyToClipboard(text As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText text
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
End Sub
```

You can call this function with the text you want to copy to the clipboard:

```vba
Call CopyToClipboard(Me.NodeKey.Value)
```

Note: You need to set a reference to `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library` to use `MSForms.DataObject`. To do this, go to Tools -> References in the VBA editor, and check `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library`. If you can't find it, browse for `FM20.DLL` in your system.
