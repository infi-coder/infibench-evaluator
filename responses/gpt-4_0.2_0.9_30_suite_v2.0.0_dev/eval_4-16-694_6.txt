You can use `awk` to extract the language code. Here is a modified version of your command:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | head -1 | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'
```

Here's what it does:

- `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'` : This will match and print only the `lang="..."` part. The `-o` option tells `grep` to print only the matched parts of a matching line. The regular expression `[a-zA-Z-]*` matches any sequence of letters and hyphens.
- `awk -F'"' '{print $2}'` : This uses `awk` to split the line at each double quote character and print the second field, which is the language code.

This command should work regardless of the position of the `lang` attribute within the tag.
