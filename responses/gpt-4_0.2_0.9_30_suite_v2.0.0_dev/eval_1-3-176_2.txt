The error message you're seeing is indicating that Pillow cannot find the headers or library files for zlib, which is a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source.

However, the Pillow version you're trying to install (6.0.0) does not support Python 3.8 as mentioned in the warning message:

```bash
C:\Users\rijal\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-install-di5is9gd\Pillow\setup.py:29: RuntimeWarning: Pillow does not yet support Python 3.8 and does not yet provide prebuilt Windows binaries. We do not recommend building from source on Windows.
```

You should try installing a more recent version of Pillow that supports Python 3.8. You can do this by simply running:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

This command will install the latest version of Pillow available. If you want to install a specific version, you can do so by specifying the version number like this:

```bash
pip install pillow==8.2.0
```

Replace `8.2.0` with the version number you want to install.

If you still encounter the same error, it's likely that you're missing the zlib development files. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
```

Please note that the above command is for Ubuntu/Debian. If you're using a different operating system, the command might be different.
