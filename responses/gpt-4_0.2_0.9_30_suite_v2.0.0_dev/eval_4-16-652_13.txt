The AWS CLI uses a pager program to handle its output. By default, it uses the `less` program. The pager is used to make reading of long outputs easier. However, in your case, it's causing an issue.

To disable the pager, you can set the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. You can do this in your script like this:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will disable the pager for the duration of the script. If you want to disable the pager permanently, you can add the `export AWS_PAGER=""` line to your shell's profile file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash).

If you want to redirect the output to a file, you can do so using the `>` operator:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > output.txt; 
done
```

This will write the output of the `aws sqs purge-queue` command to the `output.txt` file. If you want to append the output to the file instead of overwriting it each time, you can use the `>>` operator instead of `>`.
