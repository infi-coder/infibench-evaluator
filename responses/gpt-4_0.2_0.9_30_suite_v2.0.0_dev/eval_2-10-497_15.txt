In Rust, `Box<T>` is a smart pointer that points to data on the heap. It cannot be null. If you want to have a nullable pointer, you should use `Option<Box<T>>` instead. When the `Option` is `None`, it represents a null pointer. When it is `Some(box)`, it contains a valid `Box`.

Here is how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

You can check if the `Box<Node>` is null by checking if the `Option` is `None`:

```rust
if let Some(node) = &stack.top {
    // The Box<Node> is not null, and `node` is a reference to the Box<Node>.
} else {
    // The Box<Node> is null.
}
```

Or you can use the `is_none` or `is_some` methods:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    // The Box<Node> is null.
} else {
    // The Box<Node> is not null.
}
```
