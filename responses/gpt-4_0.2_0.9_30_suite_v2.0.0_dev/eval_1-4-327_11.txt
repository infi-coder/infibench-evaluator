In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, it actually makes the column names unique by adding a suffix to the duplicate column names. In your case, the column names of `d3` would be `a` and `a.1`.

So, to select the second column by name, you can use the following code:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

This will assign the values of the second column (named `a.1`) to the variable `second_col`.
