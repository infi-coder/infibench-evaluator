The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`. It is part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

You need to make sure that you have the correct version of Entity Framework Core installed, as the `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in EF Core 5.0. 

If you are using a version prior to EF Core 5.0, you can use the `[NotMapped]` attribute instead, or you can use the `modelBuilder` in your `DbContext` to configure the entity as a view or a query type.

Here is how you can do it:

```c#
public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<MyKeylessClass>().HasNoKey().ToView(null);
    }
}
```

In this code, `HasNoKey()` method is used to define the entity as keyless and `ToView(null)` method is used to tell EF Core that this entity is not mapped to any database table or view.

Remember to add the following using statement:

```c#
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```
