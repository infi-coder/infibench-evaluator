Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` tool. Here's how:

1. To convert your OpenSSH private key (`id_rsa`) to an RSA private key, you can use the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for your passphrase (if you have one), and then it will write the RSA private key out to the same file (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

2. You do not need to convert your public key (`id_rsa.pub`). The public key does not have a header like the private key, and it is not specific to OpenSSH or RSA. It can be used with either type of private key.

Please note that you should backup your keys before running these commands, just in case something goes wrong.
