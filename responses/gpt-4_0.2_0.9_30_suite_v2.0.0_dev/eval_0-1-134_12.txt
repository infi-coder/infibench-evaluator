It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet, which is a plugin for many text editors that greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow.

Emmet allows you to write abbreviations (like `.classname`) and then expand them into full-fledged HTML code. For example, if you type `.myclass` and then press `Tab`, it will expand into `<div class="myclass"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, it could be because:

1. Your text editor doesn't support Emmet out of the box and you need to install it as a plugin. For example, if you're using Sublime Text, you'll need to install the Emmet package.

2. You're not pressing the right key to expand the abbreviation. In most editors, this is the `Tab` key, but it could be different in yours.

3. Emmet is not enabled or not working correctly in your editor. You might need to check your editor's settings or documentation to see how to enable or troubleshoot Emmet.

If you're using Visual Studio Code, Emmet support is built-in and should work out of the box. If it's not, you can check your settings by going to `File > Preferences > Settings` and searching for "Emmet".
