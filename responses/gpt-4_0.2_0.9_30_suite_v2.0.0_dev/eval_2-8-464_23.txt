The error you're encountering is due to the fact that AWS Lambda expects a Linux executable, but you're building your Go application on a Windows machine, which results in a Windows executable. 

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go application for Linux. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables before building your application. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -o main main.go
```

This will create a Linux executable named `main` from your `main.go` file. 

After that, you need to zip this Linux executable:

```bash
zip function.zip main
```

Now, you can upload `function.zip` to AWS Lambda. 

Remember to set the handler name as `main` (the name of your executable) in AWS Lambda configuration.

This should solve your problem.
