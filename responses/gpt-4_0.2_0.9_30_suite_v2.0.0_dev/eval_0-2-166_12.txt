In Tailwind CSS, you don't directly select elements like you would in traditional CSS. Instead, you apply utility classes directly to the elements you want to style in your HTML.

For example, if you want to apply a background color to direct children `div` of a `div` with class `section`, you would do something like this:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-red-500"> <!-- Apply styles directly here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="bg-red-500"> <!-- And here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-red-500` is a utility class provided by Tailwind CSS to apply a specific background color.

If you want to apply styles to all direct children `div` of a `div` with class `section`, you would need to apply the utility classes to each child `div`.

If you want to apply styles conditionally or dynamically, you would need to use JavaScript or a JavaScript framework like React, Vue, or Angular in combination with Tailwind CSS.
