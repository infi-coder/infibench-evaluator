The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling zip archives. It's not a Composer package, so you can't install it using `composer require`.

If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can install it via the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you're using Windows, you'll need to enable it in your `php.ini` file. Find and uncomment the line:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing or enabling the extension, you should restart your web server to make sure the changes take effect.

In your `composer.json` file, you can specify that your project requires this extension with:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1",
    "ext-zip": "*"
}
```

This won't install the extension, but it will prevent `composer install` from succeeding if the extension isn't installed, which can be useful if other people are going to be working on your project and need to know about this requirement.
