The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP version 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal. If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, and XML. You can check your installed extensions by running `php -m` in your terminal. If any of these extensions are missing, you'll need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Although you've mentioned that you've updated Composer to version 2.3.10, it's worth double-checking this. You can check your Composer version by running `composer --version` in your terminal. If your Composer version is lower than 2.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

4. **Clear Composer cache**: Sometimes, Composer might be trying to use a cached version of the package, which might not be compatible with your current setup. You can clear Composer's cache by running `composer clear-cache` in your terminal.

If you've checked all of these and you're still seeing the error, it's possible that Laravel 9 has not been released yet. At the time of writing this response, the latest stable version of Laravel is 8. You can check the latest version of Laravel by visiting its [Packagist page](https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/laravel).
