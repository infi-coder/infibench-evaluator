Sure, here is a bash script that you can use to install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current version of Python
brew unlink python

# Install the required version
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed version
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will unlink the current version of Python that you have installed. If you have Python 2.x installed and want to keep it, you may need to adjust the script accordingly.
