Here is a Python function that uses the `re` module to split the input string at dashes and underscores, then uses the `str.join()` and `str.capitalize()` methods to convert the resulting list of words into camel case:

```python
import re

def to_camel_case(text):
    words = re.split('-|_', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function first splits the input string into a list of words. Then it joins the words back together into a string, capitalizing each word except the first one. The first word is left as it is to preserve the original capitalization.

Here's how it works on your test cases:

```python
print(to_camel_case(''))  # returns: ''
print(to_camel_case("the_stealth_warrior"))  # returns: 'theStealthWarrior'
print(to_camel_case("The-Stealth-Warrior"))  # returns: 'TheStealthWarrior'
print(to_camel_case("A-B-C"))  # returns: 'ABC'
```
