It seems like you're trying to get the local path of a OneDrive synced SharePoint file using VBA. Unfortunately, Excel doesn't provide a direct way to retrieve this information. However, you can use a workaround by accessing the Windows Registry where OneDrive stores the local path information.

Here's a function that you can use to get the local path of a OneDrive file:

```vba
Function GetOneDrivePath() As String
    Dim WshShell As Object
    Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
    
    ' Get the OneDrive path from the registry
    On Error Resume Next
    GetOneDrivePath = WshShell.RegRead("HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive\Accounts\Business1\UserFolder")
    On Error GoTo 0
    
    Set WshShell = Nothing
End Function
```

You can use this function in your code like this:

```vba
Sub Test()
    Dim OneDrivePath As String
    OneDrivePath = GetOneDrivePath()
    
    If OneDrivePath <> "" Then
        ' Do something with the OneDrive path
        Debug.Print OneDrivePath
    Else
        MsgBox "OneDrive path not found."
    End If
End Sub
```

Please note that the registry key might be different based on your OneDrive setup. You might need to adjust the registry key in the `RegRead` method accordingly.

Also, please be aware that accessing the Windows Registry might require administrative privileges and can potentially lead to system instability if not handled correctly. Always make sure to backup your registry before making any changes.
