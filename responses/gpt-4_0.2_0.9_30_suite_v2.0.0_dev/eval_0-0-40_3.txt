The error message you're seeing is due to a conflict between the Node.js and npm versions installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu and those installed in your Windows system. 

The `whereis` command shows that there are two installations of Node.js and npm: one in `/usr/bin/` (Ubuntu) and another in `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/` (Windows). When you run `npm -v`, the system tries to use the Windows version of npm, which doesn't work in the Ubuntu environment.

To solve this issue, you need to adjust your `PATH` environment variable to prioritize the Ubuntu versions of Node.js and npm. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your `.bashrc` file in a text editor. You can use `nano`:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:

   ```bash
   export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
   ```

   This line tells the system to look in `/usr/bin/` before other directories when searching for executables.

3. Save the file and exit the editor. If you're using `nano`, press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

4. Apply the changes by running:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

5. Now, when you run `npm -v`, it should display the version of npm installed in your Ubuntu environment.

Remember, this solution assumes that you want to use the Node.js and npm versions installed in your Ubuntu environment. If you want to use the Windows versions instead, you would need to adjust your `PATH` differently.
