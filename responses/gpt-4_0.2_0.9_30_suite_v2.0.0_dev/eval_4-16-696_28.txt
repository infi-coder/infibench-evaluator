The problem is that the `$(echo {} | sed 's/\?.*//g')` part is evaluated before the `find` command is executed, so it doesn't have the expected effect. You can solve this by wrapping your `mv` command in a bash -c command like this:

```bash
find . -type f -name '*\?*' -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do mv "$file" "${file%%\?*}"; done
```

This command will find all files with a `?` in their name and rename them by removing the `?` and everything after it. The `-print0` and `IFS= read -r -d ''` parts ensure that the command works correctly with filenames that contain spaces or other special characters.
