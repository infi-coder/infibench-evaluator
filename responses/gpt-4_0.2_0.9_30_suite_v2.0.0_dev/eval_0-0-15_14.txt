Sure, the issue is that you are returning an object from your mock, but you are trying to use it as a class. You should return a function that returns an object instead. Here's the revised version:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  // Returns a function that returns an object
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

Now, `const api = new API()` should work as expected.
