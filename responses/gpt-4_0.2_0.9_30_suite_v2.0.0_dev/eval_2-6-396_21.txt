The error is because you are trying to create an index on a navigation property `Gender`. Entity Framework does not support creating indexes on navigation properties. Instead, you should create an index on the foreign key `GenderId`.

Here is the corrected code:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, the index is created on `GenderId`, which is the foreign key for the `Gender` navigation property. This will allow Entity Framework to optimize queries that filter by `GenderId`.
