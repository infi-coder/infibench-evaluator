The error message you're seeing is due to the way the command is being interpreted by the command line. The problem is related to the embedded quotes in the command.

Here's a way to solve it:

1. Open the NetBeans IDE.
2. Go to `Tools > Options > Java > Maven > Execution`.
3. Uncheck the box that says `Use embedded Maven`.
4. Specify the path to your local Maven installation in the `Maven Home` field.

This should solve the problem. If you don't have a local Maven installation, you can download it from the [Apache Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

After downloading and extracting the Maven distribution, you need to add it to your system path:

1. Right-click on `My Computer` and select `Properties`.
2. Go to `Advanced system settings`.
3. Click on `Environment Variables`.
4. In the `System variables` section, find the `Path` variable, select it and click on `Edit`.
5. In the `Variable value` field, append the path to your Maven `bin` directory. Make sure to separate this value from the existing ones using a semicolon (`;`).

Now, your local Maven installation should be recognized by NetBeans and the build process should work as expected.
