The error message you're seeing indicates that Go is unable to find the specific version of the module you're trying to import. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The version doesn't exist: Make sure that the version v0.1.5 of the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` actually exists. You can check this by going to the repo on GitHub and looking at the tags.

2. Access issues: Even though you have access to the repo, Go might not. Go uses git to download modules, so you need to make sure that git is configured correctly. If the repo is private, you might need to set up SSH keys or provide your GitHub credentials to git. You can do this by using the `git config` command.

3. Proxy issues: If you're behind a proxy, you might need to configure Go to use it. You can do this by setting the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.

4. Cache issues: Sometimes, the module cache can cause issues. You can try clearing it by running `go clean -modcache`.

To debug this issue, you can try the following:

- Run `go get -v` to get more verbose output. This might give you more information about what's going wrong.
- Run `go env` to check your Go environment. Make sure that the `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` variables are set correctly.
- Check the configuration of git by running `git config --list`.
- Try to clone the repo manually using git. This can help you figure out if the issue is with Go or with git.

If none of the above helps, please provide more information about your setup (Go version, git version, OS, etc.) and the exact steps you're taking to build the program.
