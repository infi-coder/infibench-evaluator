Sure, you can use the `torch.cat` function to concatenate the tensors along a new dimension. But before that, you need to add an extra dimension to `d` to match the dimensions of `inps`. Here is the function:

```python
import torch

def addTensor(inps, d):
    # Add an extra dimension to d
    d = d.unsqueeze(2)
    # Concatenate along the third dimension
    result = torch.cat((inps, d), 2)
    return result
```

This function first adds an extra dimension to `d` using the `unsqueeze` function, making its size [64, 161, 1]. Then it concatenates `inps` and `d` along the third dimension (dimension index 2), resulting in a tensor of size [64, 161, 2].
