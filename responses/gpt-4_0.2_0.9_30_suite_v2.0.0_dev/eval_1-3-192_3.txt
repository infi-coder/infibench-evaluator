Here is a Python solution using the `re` module to split the input string at either dashes or underscores, and then using a list comprehension to capitalize the first letter of each word (except the first one) and join them together:

```python
import re

def to_camel_case(text):
    words = re.split('-|_', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into a list of words at either dashes or underscores. Then it returns a new string that is the concatenation of the first word and the rest of the words with their first letter capitalized. The `capitalize()` method capitalizes the first letter of a string and makes all other characters lowercase, which is exactly what we want for camel case.

Here's how it works on your test cases:

```python
print(to_camel_case(''))  # ''
print(to_camel_case("the_stealth_warrior"))  # 'theStealthWarrior'
print(to_camel_case("The-Stealth-Warrior"))  # 'TheStealthWarrior'
print(to_camel_case("A-B-C"))  # 'ABC'
```
