The code you provided seems correct and should work as expected. However, there could be a few reasons why it's not working:

1. **Network issues**: The Apollo Client might not be able to reach the server due to network issues. Make sure your device/emulator has access to the internet and can reach the server.

2. **Server issues**: The server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' might be down or not responding. You can check this by trying to access the server URL in your browser.

3. **CORS issues**: The server might not be set up to accept requests from your origin. This would result in a CORS error. You can check for this in the network tab of your browser's developer tools.

4. **Apollo Client setup**: There might be an issue with how the Apollo Client is set up. Make sure you're using the correct version of Apollo Client and that it's compatible with your version of React Native.

5. **Query issues**: There might be an issue with the query you're sending. Make sure the query is correct and that the server is set up to handle it.

Here are a few debugging steps you can take:

- Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools to see if the request is being sent and what the response is.
- Check the console for any error messages.
- Try sending a different query to see if that works.
- Try using a different GraphQL server to see if that works.

If none of these steps help, you might want to consider reaching out to the Apollo community or the server's maintainers for help.
