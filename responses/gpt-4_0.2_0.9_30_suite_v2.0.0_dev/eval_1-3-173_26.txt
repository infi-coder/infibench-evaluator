Sure, you can use the `calendar` module in Python to check if a year is a leap year or not. Here is a function that does exactly that:

```python
import calendar

def DaysInYear(year):
    if calendar.isleap(year):
        return 366
    else:
        return 365
```

This function takes a year as an argument and returns the total number of days in that year. The `calendar.isleap(year)` function returns `True` if the year is a leap year, and `False` otherwise.
