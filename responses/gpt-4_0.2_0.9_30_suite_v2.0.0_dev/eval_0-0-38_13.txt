Sure, you should put your `console.log(this.newIds);` inside the subscribe block to ensure it waits for the response. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
this.repository.getById(Ids).subscribe((response) => {
  this.newIds = response.map((id) => {
    return id;
  });
  console.log(this.newIds);
});
```
This way, `console.log(this.newIds);` will only run after the response is received and `this.newIds` is updated.
