Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a traditional RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` tool. Here's how:

1. Convert OpenSSH private key to RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for the passphrase (if any). After entering the passphrase, the key will be re-written in place in the RSA format. The `-p` option tells `ssh-keygen` to change the passphrase of a private key file, `-m PEM` tells it to use the older PEM format instead of the new OpenSSH format, and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file to convert.

2. You don't need to convert the public key. The public key format is standard and should be accepted by the server regardless of whether the private key is in OpenSSH or RSA format. The public key file does not have a header like the private key because it only contains the public part of the key, which is not sensitive information.

Please note that this operation doesn't change the key itself, just the format of the file. The server administrator doesn't need to do anything on their end, your public key will still work.
