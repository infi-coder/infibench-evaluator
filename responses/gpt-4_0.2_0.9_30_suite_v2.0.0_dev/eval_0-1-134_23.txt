It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that provides shortcuts for generating HTML and CSS. 

In your case, typing `.classname` and then pressing `Tab` should generate `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, it could be for a few reasons:

1. You're not using a text editor that supports Emmet. Emmet is supported in many text editors, including VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, and others. If you're not using one of these editors, you might need to switch to one that supports Emmet or find a plugin for your current editor that provides similar functionality.

2. Emmet is not installed or enabled. If you're using a text editor that supports Emmet, make sure that it's installed and enabled. In VS Code, for example, Emmet support is enabled by default, but in other editors, you might need to install it as a plugin.

3. You're not using the correct syntax. Make sure you're typing `.classname` and then pressing `Tab`. If you're doing something slightly different, like pressing `Enter` instead of `Tab`, it might not work.

4. There might be a conflict with another plugin. If you have other plugins installed that provide similar functionality, they might be interfering with Emmet. Try disabling other plugins to see if that fixes the problem.

If you've checked all of these things and it's still not working, you might need to look for specific troubleshooting steps for your particular text editor.
