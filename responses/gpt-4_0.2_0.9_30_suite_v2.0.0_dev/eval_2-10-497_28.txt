In Rust, you don't have null pointers like in C or C++. Instead, you have the `Option` type, which can be `Some` or `None`. This is a safer way to handle the absence of a value.

To implement a stack, you can use `Option<Box<Node>>` for the `next` field in `Node` and the `top` field in `Stack`. Here's how you can do it:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

You can check if a `Box<Node>` is `None` (similar to null) like this:

```rust
if let Some(node) = &stack.top {
    // The stack is not empty
} else {
    // The stack is empty
}
```

Or you can use the `is_none()` or `is_some()` methods:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    // The stack is empty
}

if stack.top.is_some() {
    // The stack is not empty
}
```

Remember, in Rust, you don't have to manually deallocate memory. When `Box<Node>` goes out of scope, it will be deallocated automatically.
