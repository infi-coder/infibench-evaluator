In TypeScript, you can define the type of an object directly in the function parameter. However, the syntax you used is incorrect. You should define the type outside of the array brackets. Here is the correct way to define your function:

```typescript
bagTotal = (products: {name: string, price: number, description: string}[]) => {
 // function does stuff
}
```

In this case, `products` is an array of objects, where each object has a `name` property of type `string`, a `price` property of type `number`, and a `description` property of type `string`.
