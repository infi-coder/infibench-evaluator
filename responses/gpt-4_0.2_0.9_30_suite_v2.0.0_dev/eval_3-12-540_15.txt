Yes, Flutter provides a widget called `VerticalDivider` to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here is an example of how you can use it:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line is drawn between two text components. The `VerticalDivider` widget allows you to customize the color and thickness of the line. 

Please note that the `VerticalDivider` widget is only visible when used in a `Row` or `Flex` widget. If you use it in a `Column` widget, it will not be visible because its width is 0.
