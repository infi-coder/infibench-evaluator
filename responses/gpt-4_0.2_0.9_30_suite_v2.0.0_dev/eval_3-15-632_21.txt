Assuming that the data you want to split is comma-separated, you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the data into an array and then assign the array elements to the respective columns. Here's how you can do it:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, ",") 'Assuming comma as delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code will split the `textline` into an array `splitData` using comma as the delimiter. Then it assigns the array elements to the columns G, H, I, J, and K.

Please replace the comma in the `Split` function with the actual delimiter in your data if it's not a comma. Also, ensure that the data always contains the expected number of elements to avoid out-of-range errors.
