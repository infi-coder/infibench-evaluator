You should use `@Configuration` when you want to create Spring Beans using Spring's Java-based configuration. This annotation is used on classes which define beans. `@Bean` is a method-level annotation and a direct analog of the XML `<bean/>` element. The annotated methods are used to instantiate and configure beans.

On the other hand, `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Component` are stereotypes used for auto-detection of components. 

- `@Service`: Annotate classes at the service layer level.
- `@Controller`: Annotate classes at the presentation layers level, mainly used in Spring MVC.
- `@Component`: This is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.

So, use `@Configuration` to define beans when you need more control over the bean configuration or when you are creating library code that needs to instantiate and configure a set of related beans. Use `@Service/@Controller/@Component` for auto-detection of application components.
