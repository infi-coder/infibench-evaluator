The `rename` function is used to rename the DataFrame's index or columns. However, in your case, you are trying to rename the Series object's name, not the DataFrame's column. The `groupby` function returns a Series object when only one column is selected, not a DataFrame.

Here is the correct way to rename the column:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg.rename(columns={"p": "mean"}, inplace=True)
    return avg
```

In this function, `reset_index` is used to convert the Series object to a DataFrame. Then, the `rename` function is used to rename the column from "p" to "mean". 

Here is how you can use this function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

datafile = 'your_data_file_path'
datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])

new_df = renameDataFrame(df)
print(new_df)
```

Please replace `'your_data_file_path'` with your actual data file path.
