For the CSRF token mismatch error, it could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the public directory of your Laravel application. Incorrect domain configuration could lead to issues with session handling.

2. **Cookie Domain**: If your application is under a subdomain, you might need to specify the cookie domain in your `config/session.php` file. For example, if your application is under `app.example.com`, you should set `'domain' => '.example.com'` in your session configuration.

3. **Secure Cookies**: If your application is not running under HTTPS, but the `config/session.php` file has `'secure' => true`, it could cause issues. Make sure this setting matches your actual environment.

4. **Session Driver**: If you're using a driver other than `file` for sessions (like `database` or `redis`), make sure the respective service is correctly configured and running.

For the email sending issue, the error message suggests that there's a problem with the SSL version. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Change Encryption Method**: Try changing `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` from `ssl` to `tls` in your `.env` file. Some servers may not support SSL, or may be using a different version.

2. **Change Port**: You could also try changing `MAIL_PORT` to `465` which is the standard port for SMTP over SSL.

3. **Disable Encryption**: If the server doesn't require an encrypted connection, you could try setting `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` to `null`.

Remember to clear the configuration cache (`php artisan config:cache`) after making changes to the `.env` file.
