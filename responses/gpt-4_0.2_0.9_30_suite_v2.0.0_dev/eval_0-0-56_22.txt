The issue you're facing is likely due to the fact that Vite's dev server is binding to `localhost` by default, which means it's only accessible from within the Docker container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container (i.e., your host machine), you need to bind the server to `0.0.0.0`.

You can do this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, not just `localhost`, which should allow you to access the dev server from your host machine.

Remember to rebuild your Docker container after making this change, as the updated configuration needs to be included in the container.
