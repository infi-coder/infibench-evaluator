The error message is indicating that you're trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`), which is not allowed. Navigation properties are used to establish relationships between entities in Entity Framework, they are not mapped to a specific column in the database, so you can't create an index on them.

If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property, you should do it like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```
This will create an index on the `GenderId` column in the `User` table.
