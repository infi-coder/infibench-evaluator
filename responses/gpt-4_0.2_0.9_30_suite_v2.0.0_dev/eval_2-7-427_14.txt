For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the public directory of your Laravel application. Incorrect domain configuration could lead to session issues.

2. **Session Cookies**: Check if your application is correctly setting session cookies. If your application is not setting cookies correctly, it could lead to multiple sessions being created for the same user.

3. **HTTPS**: If your application is being served over HTTPS, ensure that your SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE configuration option is set to true. If it's set to false, your application may not be able to read the session cookie.

4. **Session Domain**: If your application is served from a subdomain, you may need to specify the session domain in your session configuration file.

For the second issue, the error message "SSL operation failed with code 1. OpenSSL Error messages: error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number" suggests that there is a mismatch between the SSL/TLS version that your application is trying to use to connect to the SMTP server and the version that the server supports.

Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Change MAIL_ENCRYPTION**: Try changing the MAIL_ENCRYPTION setting in your .env file from 'ssl' to 'tls'. Some servers do not support SSLv3 due to security vulnerabilities and instead use TLS.

2. **Check MAIL_PORT**: The port you're using (587) is typically used for STARTTLS, which starts with an unencrypted connection and upgrades to an encrypted connection. If your server requires an encrypted connection from the start, you may need to use port 465.

3. **Contact Server Administrator**: If neither of the above solutions work, you may need to contact the administrator of the SMTP server to find out which encryption methods and ports are supported.

Remember to clear your config cache (`php artisan config:clear`) after making changes to your .env file.
