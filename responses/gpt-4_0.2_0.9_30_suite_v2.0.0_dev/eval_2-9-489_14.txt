The warning message you're seeing is because your Elasticsearch server does not have security features enabled. This means that anyone can access your Elasticsearch server without any authentication.

To fix this, you need to enable the built-in security features of Elasticsearch. Here are the steps to do it:

1. Open your `elasticsearch.yml` file. This file is usually located in the `config` directory of your Elasticsearch installation.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart your Elasticsearch server.

Please note that enabling security will require you to use a username and password when accessing your Elasticsearch server. The default username is `elastic`. To set the password, you can use the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` command-line tool that comes with Elasticsearch.

Here is how you can use it:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Navigate to your Elasticsearch installation directory.

3. Run the following command:

```bash
bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
```

4. Follow the prompts to set the passwords for the built-in users.

After doing these steps, your Elasticsearch server should now have security features enabled.

If you're using Searchkick in your Rails app, you'll also need to update your configuration to include the username and password. Here is an example:

```ruby
Searchkick.client = Elasticsearch::Client.new(
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"],
  transport_options: {
    request: { timeout: 5 }
  },
  user: "elastic", # replace with the actual username
  password: "password" # replace with the actual password
)
```

Remember to replace `"elastic"` and `"password"` with the actual username and password you set.

Also, keep in mind that enabling security on your Elasticsearch server is a good practice for production environments. However, for development or testing environments, it might be easier to disable security to avoid dealing with authentication.
