It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a package called Emmet. Emmet is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allow for high-speed coding and editing in HTML, XML, CSS, and other web languages.

For example, if you type `.classname` and press `Tab`, it should automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If it's not working for you, it could be because of a few reasons:

1. **You don't have Emmet installed or enabled.** If you're using a text editor like Visual Studio Code, Emmet is included by default. For other text editors like Sublime Text or Atom, you might need to install it manually.

2. **Your file is not saved with the correct extension.** Emmet only works in files with certain extensions like `.html`, `.css`, etc. Make sure your file is saved with the correct extension.

3. **You're not using the correct syntax.** Make sure you're typing `.classname` and then pressing `Tab`. If you're still having trouble, you might want to check the [Emmet Cheat Sheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) for more information.

4. **Your text editor is not in the correct mode.** Some text editors have different modes (like insert mode, command mode, etc.). Make sure you're in the correct mode to use Emmet.

If you've checked all of these and it's still not working, you might want to look for specific instructions for your text editor.
