You can use the `iter()` method to create an iterator over the vector, and then use the `min()` method to find the minimum value. Here's how you can do it:

```rust
let mut v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
let min = v.iter().min();

match min {
    Some(min) => println!("The minimum value is {}", min),
    None => println!("The vector is empty"),
}
```

In this code, `v.iter().min()` returns an `Option<&i32>`. If the vector is empty, `min()` returns `None`. If the vector is not empty, `min()` returns `Some(&i32)`, where `&i32` is a reference to the minimum value. The `match` statement is used to handle both cases.

Please note that `min()` returns a reference to the minimum value, not the value itself. If you need the value itself, you can dereference it using `*`. However, you should only do this after checking that the `Option<&i32>` is not `None`, to avoid a panic at runtime.
