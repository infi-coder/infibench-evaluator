The error message you're seeing indicates that Go is unable to find the specified version of the module. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Network issues**: Ensure that you have a stable internet connection and that you're able to reach the module's host (github.ibm.com in this case).

2. **Access issues**: If the module is in a private repository, you need to ensure that the machine where you're trying to build the program has access to this repository. This usually involves setting up SSH keys or providing username and password. If you're using SSH, make sure that the key is added to the ssh-agent and that the ssh-agent is running.

3. **Incorrect version**: The version specified in the `go.mod` file might not exist. Check the repository to ensure that the version you're trying to use actually exists.

4. **Proxy issues**: If you're behind a proxy, you might need to configure Go to use it. You can do this by setting the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.

To debug this issue, you can use the `-x` flag with the `go build` command. This will print out all the commands that `go build` is executing, which might give you more information about what's going wrong:

```bash
$ go build -x
```

If the module is in a private repository, you might need to use the `git` command to clone the repository manually to see if there are any issues with access or network:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client.git
```

If you're able to clone the repository manually but `go build` is still failing, it might be an issue with how Go is trying to fetch the module. In this case, you might need to look into Go's module download mechanisms.
