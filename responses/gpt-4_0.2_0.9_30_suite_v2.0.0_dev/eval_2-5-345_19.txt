The error message you're seeing is due to a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the version of Maven that's bundled with Spring Boot 2.7.0. 

The root cause is that IntelliJ IDEA is trying to use a class (`org.apache.maven.model.validation.DefaultModelValidator`) from Maven that has been removed in the version bundled with Spring Boot 2.7.0.

To resolve this issue, you can downgrade the Maven version to 3.8.4 or earlier, or upgrade your IntelliJ IDEA to the latest version which has fixed this compatibility issue.

Here are the steps to downgrade Maven version:

1. Open the `pom.xml` file in your project.
2. Find the `properties` section.
3. Change the `maven` version to 3.8.4 or earlier. For example:

```xml
<properties>
    <maven.version>3.8.4</maven.version>
</properties>
```

To upgrade IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Go to `Help` > `Check for Updates...`
3. If there are updates available, click `Update` and follow the prompts to install the updates.

Remember to restart IntelliJ IDEA after updating it or changing the Maven version.
