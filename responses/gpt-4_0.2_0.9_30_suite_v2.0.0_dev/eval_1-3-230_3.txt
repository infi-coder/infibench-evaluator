The `_io.BytesIO` object is a type of I/O stream for bytes data. If you want to convert it to a bytes-like object, you can use the `getvalue()` method. This method returns the entire contents of the BytesIO object as a bytes object.

Here is how you can modify your function:

```python
def uncompress_body(self, compression_type, body):
    if isinstance(body, _io.BytesIO):
        body = body.getvalue()

    if compression_type == 'gzip' or compression_type == 'compress':
        return zlib.decompress(body)
    elif compression_type == 'deflate':
        compressor = zlib.compressobj(9, zlib.DEFLATED, -zlib.MAX_WBITS)
        compressed = compressor.compress(body)
        compressed += compressor.flush()
        return base64.b64encode(compressed)

    return body
```

In this code, `body.getvalue()` is used to convert the `_io.BytesIO` object to a bytes object. This will only happen if the `body` is an instance of `_io.BytesIO`. If it's already a bytes object, the function will leave it as it is.
