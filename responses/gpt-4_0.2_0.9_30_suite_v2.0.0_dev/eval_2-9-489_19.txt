The warning message is indicating that your Elasticsearch instance is not secured, meaning it doesn't require authentication to access. This could potentially allow anyone to access your Elasticsearch data.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Open the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file in a text editor. The location of this file depends on how you installed Elasticsearch, but it's often located in the `/etc/elasticsearch` or `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

    ```yaml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save and close the file.

4. Restart Elasticsearch to apply the changes. The command to do this depends on how you installed Elasticsearch, but it's often something like `sudo service elasticsearch restart` or `brew services restart elasticsearch-full`.

After doing this, you should no longer see the warning message. However, you will now need to set up passwords for the built-in Elasticsearch users, and configure your Rails app to use these passwords when connecting to Elasticsearch. You can find more information on how to do this in the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html).

Please note that enabling security will also enable TLS for the transport networking layer. This means that you will need to configure TLS as well, which can be a complex process. If you're only using Elasticsearch for development or testing, and not in a production environment, you might want to consider running it in a Docker container with security already enabled, or using a managed Elasticsearch service that handles security for you.
