It seems like there's a bit of confusion here. iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" that you can enable or disable like Android. The message you're seeing is likely related to the provisioning profile used to sign the app. 

If you're trying to install an app that's been signed with a developer provisioning profile, you'll need to trust the developer on your device. Here's how you can do that:

1. After installing the app, go to `Settings` > `General` > `Profiles` or `Profiles & Device Management`. You should see a profile under a header called "Developer App".

2. Tap on the profile.

3. Tap on `Trust "<Developer>"`.

4. In the popup window, tap `Trust`.

Now you should be able to run the app. If you're still having trouble, it's possible that the app was signed with a provisioning profile that doesn't include your device's UDID. In that case, you'll need to get a new build of the app that's been signed with a profile that includes your device.
