Font Awesome 5 has a few changes in the way it's used compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is no longer just "FontAwesome", it's now specific to the style of icon you're using. The styles are "Font Awesome 5 Free", "Font Awesome 5 Brands", and "Font Awesome 5 Pro". 

The `content` values have also changed for some icons. The value for the angle-down icon (which I'm assuming you're using based on your `content` value) is now `"\f107"`.

Here's how you can update your CSS for Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

The `font-weight` is added because Font Awesome 5 uses different weights to differentiate between solid (`900`), regular (`400`), and light (`300`) icons. The angle-down icon is a solid icon, so we use `900`.

Please note that you should check the Font Awesome 5 documentation or cheat sheet to make sure you're using the correct `content` value for your icon.
