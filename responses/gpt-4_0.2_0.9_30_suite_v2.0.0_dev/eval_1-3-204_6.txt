The `rename` function in pandas is used to rename the labels of DataFrame. However, in your case, you are trying to rename the Series object returned by the `mean()` function, not a DataFrame. 

Here is the correct way to rename the column:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index().rename(columns={"p":"mean"})
    return avg
```

In this function, `reset_index()` is used to convert the Series object to a DataFrame. Then, you can use `rename` to rename the column. The `mean` function is used to calculate the average of the "p" column for each group of "t". 

Here is a complete example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index().rename(columns={"p":"mean"})
    return avg

data = {
    't': [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3],
    'p': [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    'x': [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
    'y': [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21],
    'z': [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(renameDataFrame(df))
```

This will output:

```
   t  mean
0  1   4.5
1  2   6.5
2  3   8.5
```

This shows the mean of the "p" column for each group of "t".
