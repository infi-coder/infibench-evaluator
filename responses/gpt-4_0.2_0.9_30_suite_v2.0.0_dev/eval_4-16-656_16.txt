The `Get-Service` cmdlet does not provide the service description directly. However, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to retrieve the service description. Here is how you can do it:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service" | Select-Object Name, Description | Out-GridView
```

This command will get all the services and their descriptions and display them in a grid view.

If you want to get the description for a specific service, you can modify the query like this:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service Where Name = 'YourServiceName'" | Select-Object Name, Description
```

Replace `'YourServiceName'` with the name of the service you want to get the description for.
