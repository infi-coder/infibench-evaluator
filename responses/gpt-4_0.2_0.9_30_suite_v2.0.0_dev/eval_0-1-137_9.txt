The error you're getting is because you're trying to redefine the `$theme-colors` map after it's been imported from Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file. The correct way to customize Bootstrap's default variables is to override them before they are imported.

Here's how you can do it:

```scss
// Define your custom colors
$primary:   #some-color-here;
$secondary: #some-color-here;
$success:   #some-color-here;
$info:      #some-color-here;
$warning:   #some-color-here;
$danger:    #some-color-here;
$light:     #some-color-here;
$dark:      #some-color-here;

// Update the theme colors map
$theme-colors: (
  "primary":    $primary,
  "secondary":  $secondary,
  "success":    $success,
  "info":       $info,
  "warning":    $warning,
  "danger":     $danger,
  "light":      $light,
  "dark":       $dark
);

// Import Bootstrap
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

This way, you're defining your own colors and updating the `$theme-colors` map before Bootstrap is imported. When Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file is imported, it will use your custom colors instead of the default ones.

Remember to replace `#some-color-here` with the actual color values you want to use.
