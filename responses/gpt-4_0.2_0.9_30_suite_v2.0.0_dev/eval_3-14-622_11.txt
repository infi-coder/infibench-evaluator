To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement a function that returns a `Shader`. Here is how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedStyle())
    }
}

struct RedStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        // Implementation here
    }
    
    func _makeView(view: _GraphValue<_ShapeView<Self, _StrokedShape<_InsetAround<Rectangle>>>>, inputs: _ViewInputs) -> _ViewOutputs {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

However, these methods are marked as internal (`_apply` and `_makeView`) and are not intended to be used directly. 

In SwiftUI, you typically don't need to conform to `ShapeStyle` directly. Instead, you use the provided types that conform to `ShapeStyle`, such as `Color`, `LinearGradient`, `RadialGradient`, and `AngularGradient`.

In your case, you can simply use `Color.red` directly:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(Color.red)
    }
}
```

If you want to create a custom color, you can create an extension of `Color`:

```swift
extension Color {
    static let myRed = Color.red
}

struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(Color.myRed)
    }
}
```

This way, you can use `Color.myRed` anywhere you would use `Color.red`.
