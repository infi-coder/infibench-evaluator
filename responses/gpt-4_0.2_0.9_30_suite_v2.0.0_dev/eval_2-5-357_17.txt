The `@Autowired` annotation is not required for constructor injection from Spring 4.3 onwards, if the target bean only defines one constructor. Spring automatically uses that constructor for dependency injection.

However, if there are multiple constructors, Spring doesn't know which one to use, so you need to add `@Autowired` to the constructor you want Spring to use for dependency injection.

People might still use `@Autowired` on constructors out of habit, for explicitness, or because they're working in a codebase that also needs to be compatible with older versions of Spring.
