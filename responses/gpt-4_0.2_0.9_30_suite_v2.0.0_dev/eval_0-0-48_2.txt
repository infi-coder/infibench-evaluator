Sure, the issue with your code is that TypeScript does not allow you to use multiple indexed types in one type. You can solve this by creating an intersection type. Here is the corrected code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type `FruitsAndColors` where each fruit has a numeric value and each color has a boolean value.
