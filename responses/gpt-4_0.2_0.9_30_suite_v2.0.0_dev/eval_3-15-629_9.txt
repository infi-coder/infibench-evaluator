You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. Here's a simple function that you can use:

```vba
Function CopyToClipboard(s As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText s
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
    Set DataObj = Nothing
End Function
```

You can use this function like this:

```vba
CopyToClipboard Me.NodeKey.Value
```

Note: You need to set a reference to `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library` to use `MSForms.DataObject`. You can do this by going to `Tools -> References` in the VBA editor and checking `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library`. If you don't see it, you may need to browse for `FM20.DLL` (usually located in `C:\Windows\System32` or `C:\Windows\SysWOW64`).
