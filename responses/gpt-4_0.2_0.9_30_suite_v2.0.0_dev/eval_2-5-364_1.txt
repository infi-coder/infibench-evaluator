If you are using GitHub Actions, you can use the `actions/setup-java` action to set up the JDK version you need. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```yaml
name: Java CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up JDK 1.8
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with:
        java-version: 1.8
    - name: Build with Maven
      run: ./mvnw clean install
```

In this example, the `actions/setup-java@v1` action is used to set up JDK 1.8. Then, Maven is run with the `./mvnw clean install` command.

If you are using a different CI/CD tool, the process might be slightly different, but the general idea is the same: you need to set up the JDK version you need before running Maven.
