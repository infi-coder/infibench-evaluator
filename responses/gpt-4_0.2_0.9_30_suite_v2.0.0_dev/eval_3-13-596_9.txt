The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` file is generated by the `bootJar` task in Spring Boot 2.5.0. This is a new feature introduced in Spring Boot 2.5.0 to provide a jar file without the embedded container.

If you want to disable the generation of the `*-plain.jar` file, you can configure the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file as follows:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will prevent the `bootJar` task from running, and thus the `*-plain.jar` file will not be generated.
