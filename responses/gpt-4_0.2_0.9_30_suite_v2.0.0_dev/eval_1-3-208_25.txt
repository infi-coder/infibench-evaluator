Sure, I can help with that. The problem with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, not if each individual character is in the `correct` string. 

Here is a corrected version of your function:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = set(string.ascii_letters + string.digits)
    return set(text).issubset(correct)
```

This function works by first creating a set of all valid characters. It then checks if every character in the input string is in this set. If it is, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

You can use this function like this:

```python
text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

This will print "Success" if the input string only contains characters from "a-z", "A-Z", and "0-9", and "Failure" otherwise.
