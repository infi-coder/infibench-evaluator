In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, the column names of the resulting data frame are made unique by adding a suffix. 

In your case, the column names of `d3` would be `a` and `a.1`. So, to select the second column, you can use `d3$a.1`.

Here is the code:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

Please note that this behavior may depend on the version of R and the packages you have loaded. If `d3$a.1` does not work, you can select the second column by its index like this:

```r
second_col <- d3[,2]
```
