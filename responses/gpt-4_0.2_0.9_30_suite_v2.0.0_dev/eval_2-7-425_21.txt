You can use the `now()` function of Laravel to get the current date and time. Here's how you can modify your function:

```php
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array("name" => $name, "address" => $address, "created_at" => now(), "updated_at" => now());
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```
The `now()` function will return the current date and time in the format 'Y-m-d H:i:s', which is the format MySQL uses for datetime.

However, if you are using Laravel's Eloquent ORM and have `$timestamps = true;` in your model (which is the default), Laravel will automatically handle the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields for you, so you don't need to manually set them.
