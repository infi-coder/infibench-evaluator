The "419 Page Expired" error is due to Laravel's CSRF protection. When you log out from one tab, the session is invalidated. So, when you try to log out from the other tab, the CSRF token associated with that session is no longer valid, hence the 419 error.

To handle this situation, you can catch the `TokenMismatchException` in your `Handler.php` file and redirect the user to the login page. Here is how you can do it:

```php
// app/Exceptions/Handler.php

public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof \Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException) {
        return redirect('/login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

This way, if a `TokenMismatchException` is thrown (which is what happens when a CSRF token is invalid), the user will be redirected to the login page instead of seeing the 419 error page.

Remember to import the `Exception` class at the top of your `Handler.php` file:

```php
use Exception;
```

This solution should work for your case, but keep in mind that it might not be the best approach for all applications, as it bypasses Laravel's CSRF protection when a `TokenMismatchException` is thrown.
