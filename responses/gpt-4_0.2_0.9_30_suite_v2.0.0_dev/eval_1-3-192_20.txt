Here is a Python function that uses the `re` module to split the input string at underscores and hyphens, then uses the `str.join()` and `str.capitalize()` methods to join the words together in camel case:

```python
import re

def to_camel_case(text):
    words = re.split('-|_', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into a list of words. It then joins the words back together, capitalizing each word except for the first one. The first word is left as it is to preserve its original capitalization.

Here's how it works:

- `re.split('-|_', text)` splits the input string at underscores and hyphens.
- `words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])` joins the words back together, capitalizing each word except for the first one. The `str.join()` method concatenates a list of strings into a single string, inserting the specified delimiter between each string. The `str.capitalize()` method capitalizes the first character of a string.

This function should pass all the provided test cases.
