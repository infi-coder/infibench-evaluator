Here is a Python function that does what you want. It first creates a dictionary that maps the first four elements of `b` to the elements in `rest`. Then it goes through the `last` list and replaces any element that is in the dictionary with its corresponding value.

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    # Create a dictionary that maps the first four elements of b to rest
    mapping = {b[i]: rest[i] for i in range(4)}
    
    # Replace elements in last that are in the dictionary
    last = [mapping.get(x, x) for x in last]
    
    return last
```

You can test this function with your example:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

print(ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last))  # Output: [11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

This function assumes that the `rest` and `b` lists have at least four elements. If they might have fewer elements, you should add some error checking code.
