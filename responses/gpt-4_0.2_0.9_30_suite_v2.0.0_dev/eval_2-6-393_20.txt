The error message you're seeing is because you're trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`). Indexes in Entity Framework Core are not supported on navigation properties, they can only be created on scalar properties.

So, instead of creating an index on `Gender` navigation property, you should create an index on `GenderId` which is a foreign key property.

Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);` creates an index on `GenderId` property of `User` entity.
