The error you're encountering is due to the fact that AWS Lambda expects a Linux binary, but you're building your Go application on a Windows machine, which produces a Windows binary. 

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code to a Linux binary. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables before building your Go code. 

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build main.go
```

This will produce a Linux binary named `main` that can be run on AWS Lambda.

After building the binary, you can zip it and upload it to AWS Lambda:

```bash
zip function.zip main
```

Then, upload `function.zip` to your Lambda function. 

Remember to set the handler name to `main` (the name of your binary) in the AWS Lambda console.

Now, your Lambda function should work as expected.
