This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being associated with a target. Here's how you can check and fix this:

1. Open the file that contains your `ContentView_Previews`.
2. In the File Inspector (the first tab in the right sidebar), under "Target Membership", make sure your app's target is checked.

If this doesn't solve your problem, try the following:

1. Clean your build folder (Product > Clean Build Folder).
2. Quit Xcode.
3. Delete derived data. You can find this folder by going to Xcode > Preferences > Locations. Next to "Derived Data", click on the arrow to open the folder in Finder. Then, delete the folder related to your project.
4. Restart your computer.
5. Open your project and try again.

If none of these work, it might be a bug with Xcode 12.3. You could try updating to a newer version of Xcode if available.
