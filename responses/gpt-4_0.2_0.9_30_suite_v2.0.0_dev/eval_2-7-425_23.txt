You can use the `now()` function provided by Laravel to get the current date and time. Here's how you can modify your function to store the current date time in the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields:

```php
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array("name" => $name, "address" => $address, "created_at" => now(), "updated_at" => now());
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

In this code, `now()` will return the current date and time in the format required by MySQL. 

However, if you are using Laravel's Eloquent ORM to manage your database operations, you don't need to manually set the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields. Laravel will automatically set these fields for you when you create or update a model.
