The error message indicates that the JSON decoding failed because the response body does not start with a valid JSON character. This could be due to several reasons:

1. The server might not be returning a valid JSON response.
2. The server might be returning an error message or a different data format that cannot be parsed as JSON.
3. There might be leading or trailing whitespaces in the response.

Here are a few steps you can take to debug and solve this issue:

1. **Print the response body**: Before trying to decode the response, print it to the console. This will help you understand what you're receiving from the server.

```dart
print('Response body: ${response.body}');
```

2. **Check the server-side script**: Ensure that your PHP script is correctly outputting a JSON response. You can use `json_encode()` in PHP to convert an array or object into a JSON string.

3. **Trim the response**: If the response contains leading or trailing whitespaces, you can remove them using the `trim()` method before decoding the JSON.

```dart
List data = json.decode(response.body.trim());
```

4. **Handle errors**: If the server might return an error message instead of the expected JSON, you should handle this in your Dart code. You can check the HTTP status code of the response and only try to decode the JSON if the request was successful.

```dart
if (response.statusCode == 200) {
  List data = json.decode(response.body.trim());
} else {
  print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}.');
}
```

Remember, the response body is a `String`, and `json.decode()` expects a valid JSON string. If the string isn't valid JSON, `json.decode()` will throw a `FormatException`.
