The error you're seeing is due to Laravel's built-in CSRF protection. When you log out from one tab, the session is invalidated. So, when you try to log out from the other tab, Laravel can't find the session and throws a `419 Page Expired` error.

To handle this, you can customize the `logout` method in your `LoginController`. You can catch the `TokenMismatchException` and redirect the user to the login page.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```php
use Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException;

public function logout(Request $request)
{
    try {
        $this->guard()->logout();

        $request->session()->invalidate();

        $request->session()->regenerateToken();
    } catch (TokenMismatchException $e) {
        // Catch the TokenMismatchException and redirect to login
        return redirect('/login');
    }

    return $this->loggedOut($request) ?: redirect('/');
}
```

In this code, we're overriding the `logout` method from the `AuthenticatesUsers` trait. We're wrapping the logout logic in a `try-catch` block. If a `TokenMismatchException` is thrown, we catch it and redirect the user to the login page.

This way, even if the user tries to log out from a tab where the session has already been invalidated, they will be redirected to the login page instead of seeing the `419 Page Expired` error.
