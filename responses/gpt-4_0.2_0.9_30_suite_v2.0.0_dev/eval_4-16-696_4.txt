The issue is that the `$(echo {} | sed 's/\?.*//g')` part of your command is evaluated before the `find` command is run, so it doesn't have the expected effect.

You can use a bash loop to process the files found by `find`:

```bash
find . -type f -name '*\?*' | while read file; do mv "$file" "${file%%\?*}"; done
```

This command uses `find` to locate the files, and then processes each file with a `while` loop. The `mv` command renames each file, removing the `?` and everything after it. The `${file%%\?*}` syntax is a parameter expansion in bash that removes the longest match of `\?*` from the end of the `file` variable.
