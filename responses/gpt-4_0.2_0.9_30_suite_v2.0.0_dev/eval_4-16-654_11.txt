You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by using the `ssh-add` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open Git Bash.
2. Execute the following command to start the ssh-agent in the background:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If your private key file is `D:/keys/my-key.ppk`, you would run:

```bash
ssh-add 'D:/keys/my-key.ppk'
```

Please note that `ssh-add` command might not work with PuTTY-generated keys. If you get an error like "invalid format", you need to convert the key to OpenSSH format. You can do this using PuTTYgen:

1. Open PuTTYgen.
2. Click "Load" and select your `.ppk` key.
3. Once the key is loaded, go to "Conversions" in the menu and select "Export OpenSSH key".
4. Save the new OpenSSH key and use it with `ssh-add` command as described above.
