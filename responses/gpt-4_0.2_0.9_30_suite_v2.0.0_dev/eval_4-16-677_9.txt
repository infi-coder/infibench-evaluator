The problem is with the single quotes around your variable `$searchT`. In bash, single quotes preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes. This means that your variable `$searchT` is not being expanded to its value, but is instead being treated as the literal string `$searchT`.

To fix this, you should use double quotes instead of single quotes. Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

In this script, `$searchT` will be correctly expanded to its value when the script is run.
