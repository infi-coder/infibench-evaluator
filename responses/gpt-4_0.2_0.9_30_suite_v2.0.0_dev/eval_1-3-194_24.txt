You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write to an Excel file. Here is the function you requested:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

    # Create a workbook and select the active worksheet
    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active

    # Write the data to the worksheet
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
            ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

    # Save the workbook
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new Excel workbook, selects the active worksheet, writes the data from `new_list` into the worksheet, and then saves the workbook as "data.xlsx". 

Please note that the `openpyxl` library is not a built-in library in Python, so you need to install it first using pip:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```
