Sure, you're getting this error because you're returning an object instead of a class. Here's how you can fix it:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this code, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` is used to mock the class constructor. It returns a new object every time it's called (which is what a constructor does).
