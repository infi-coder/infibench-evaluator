The alert you're seeing is likely due to the fact that the app you're trying to open is a developer-signed app. These apps require the device to be in developer mode in order to run. However, unlike Android, iOS doesn't have a specific "Developer Mode" that can be enabled. Instead, you need to trust the developer certificate on your device.

Here are the steps to trust the developer certificate:

1. Go to `Settings` on your iOS device.
2. Scroll down and tap on `General`.
3. Scroll down to `Device Management` or `Profiles & Device Management`.
4. Under the `DEVELOPER APP` section, you should see the developer profile. Tap on it.
5. Tap on `Trust "<Developer>"`.
6. You'll see a prompt to confirm your decision, tap on `Trust` to confirm.

After these steps, you should be able to open the app. If you still can't open the app, it's possible that the app was signed with a certificate that's no longer valid. In this case, you'll need to contact the developer or your organization's IT department for help.

If you're a developer and you're trying to run your own app on your device, you'll need to install the app via Xcode. Here's how:

1. Connect your device to your Mac.
2. Open Xcode and select your project.
3. In the top left of the Xcode window, select your device from the list of available devices.
4. Click the `Run` button or press `Cmd + R` to build and run your app.

If you're still having trouble, make sure that you have the latest version of Xcode and that your device is running a version of iOS that's supported by your version of Xcode.
