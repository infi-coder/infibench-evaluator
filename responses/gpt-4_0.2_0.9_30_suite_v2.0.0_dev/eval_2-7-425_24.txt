You can use the `now()` function in Laravel to get the current date and time. Here's how you can modify your function to store the current date and time in the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields:

```php
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array("name" => $name, "address" => $address, "created_at" => now(), "updated_at" => now());
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

In the above code, `now()` will return the current date and time.

Also, if you are using Laravel's Eloquent ORM and have the `timestamps` property set to `true` in your model (which is the default), Laravel will automatically manage the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields for you. You won't need to manually set these fields when creating or updating records.
