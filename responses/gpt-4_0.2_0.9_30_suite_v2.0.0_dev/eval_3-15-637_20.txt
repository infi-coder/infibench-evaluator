The error you're experiencing might be due to several reasons. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check the SeleniumBasic version**: Ensure that you are using the latest version of SeleniumBasic. You can download it from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/florentbr/SeleniumBasic/releases).

2. **Check the WebDriver**: Ensure that the WebDriver you are using is up-to-date and compatible with the browser version you are using. For example, if you're using Chrome, you should have the latest version of ChromeDriver.

3. **Check the SeleniumBasic reference in VBA**: In the VBA editor, go to `Tools > References` and make sure that Selenium Type Library is checked.

4. **Check the browser version**: If you're using Internet Explorer, make sure it's not an outdated version. Selenium WebDriver might not work properly with older versions of browsers.

5. **Try using a different browser**: If you're still having issues with Internet Explorer, try using a different browser. You can change the browser by modifying the `driver.Start` line in your code. For example, to use Chrome, you would change it to `driver.Start "chrome"`.

6. **Check your antivirus software**: Sometimes, antivirus software can interfere with Selenium and cause issues. Try disabling your antivirus software temporarily to see if that resolves the issue.

If none of these suggestions work, please provide the exact error message you're receiving for further assistance.
