Sure, you can use the `last:` variant provided by Tailwind CSS to target the last element of a container. Here's how you can modify your code:

```html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="(item, index) in items"
    :key="`item-${index}`"
    class="border-solid border-b border-black last:border-b-0"
  >
    Item
  </li>
</ul>
```

In the above code, `last:border-b-0` will remove the bottom border from the last `<li>` element. 

Please note that by default, the `last` variant is not enabled for any utilities. You need to enable it in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  variants: {
    extend: {
      borderWidth: ['last'],
    }
  }
}
```

After you've made this change, you'll need to rebuild your CSS.
