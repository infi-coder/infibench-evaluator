Enzyme does not officially support React 17 yet. However, there is an unofficial adapter available for React 17, which is `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. You can install it using npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can update your import code like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Please note that since it's an unofficial adapter, it may not work perfectly in all situations. You might also consider using the React Testing Library, which is recommended by the React team and supports React 17.
