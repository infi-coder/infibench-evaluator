In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, it actually renames the columns of the second data frame to make them unique. The new names are created by appending a suffix to the original name. So, in your case, the column names of `d3` would be `a` and `a.1`.

You can select the second column by its new name like this:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

This will assign the values of the second column to the variable `second_col`.
