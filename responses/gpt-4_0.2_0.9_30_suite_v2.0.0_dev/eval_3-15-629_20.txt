You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. Here's a simple function to copy text to the clipboard:

```vba
Sub CopyToClipboard(text As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText text
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
End Sub
```

You can use this function like this:

```vba
Call CopyToClipboard(Me.NodeKey.Value)
```

Note: You need to add a reference to "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library" to use `MSForms.DataObject`. You can do this by going to Tools -> References in the VBA editor, and then checking the box for "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library".
