To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement the `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType)` method. Here is how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        shape.fill = Color.red._apply(to:)
    }
}
```

Please note that `_ShapeStyle_ShapeType` and `_apply(to:)` are private APIs, and using them might lead to your app being rejected from the App Store. Unfortunately, `ShapeStyle` is not designed to be conformed to outside of SwiftUI. You might want to consider using `some ShapeStyle` instead.
