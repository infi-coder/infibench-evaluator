The error you're getting is because the `to-rgb` function is not available in Sass 3. It was introduced in Sass 4.0.0.

However, you can still change the Bootstrap's default theme colors with Sass 3. You just need to import the `variables` file after you declare your custom `$theme-colors` map.

Here is how you can do it:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

In the above code, replace `#your-color-here` with the color you want to use for the primary theme color.

Please note that the above code will only change the `primary` color. If you want to change other colors as well, you need to include them in the `$theme-colors` map. For example:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-primary-color,
  "secondary": #your-secondary-color,
  "success": #your-success-color,
  "info": #your-info-color,
  "warning": #your-warning-color,
  "danger": #your-danger-color,
  "light": #your-light-color,
  "dark": #your-dark-color
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Replace `#your-xxx-color` with the colors you want to use for the corresponding theme colors.
