The error message `Parsing error: Cannot read file '.../tsconfig.json'.eslint` is suggesting that ESLint is having trouble finding your `tsconfig.json` file.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the `project` option under `parserOptions` as `tsconfig.json`. This tells ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file.

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, you will need to provide the correct relative path to the `tsconfig.json` file.

For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would need to change the `project` option to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "../tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in a different subdirectory, adjust the path accordingly. 

If the `tsconfig.json` file is in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file and you're still getting the error, there might be an issue with the `tsconfig.json` file itself. Make sure it is valid JSON and doesn't contain any syntax errors. 

If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider creating a minimal reproduction of your project and sharing it so others can help diagnose the problem.
