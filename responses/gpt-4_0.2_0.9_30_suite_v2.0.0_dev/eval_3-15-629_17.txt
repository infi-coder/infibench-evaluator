You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. Here's a simple function that you can use to copy text to the clipboard:

```vba
Sub CopyToClipboard(text As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText text
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
End Sub
```

You can use it like this:

```vba
Call CopyToClipboard(Me.NodeKey.Value)
```

Note: You need to set a reference to `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library` to use `MSForms.DataObject`. To do this, go to `Tools` > `References` in the VBA editor, and check `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library`. If you don't see it, you may need to browse for `FM20.DLL` in your system directory.
