It seems like you're facing a version conflict issue. The `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations are part of the Bean Validation 2.0 specification, which is implemented by Hibernate Validator 6.x. However, Spring Boot 2.0.x relies on Hibernate Validator 5.3.x, which implements Bean Validation 1.1. 

The error message you're seeing indicates that Hibernate Validator 5.3.x is being used, which doesn't recognize the `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations.

To resolve this issue, you can upgrade your Spring Boot version to 2.3.x or later, which relies on Hibernate Validator 6.x. You can do this by changing the version in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.0.RELEASE</version>
    <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->
</parent>
```

Alternatively, if you can't upgrade your Spring Boot version, you can use the `@NotNull` and `@Size(min=1)` annotations together to achieve the same effect as `@NotEmpty` or `@NotBlank`.
