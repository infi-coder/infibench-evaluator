You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. Here's a simple function that copies a string to the clipboard:

```vba
Sub CopyToClipboard(s As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText s
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
End Sub
```

You can use it like this:

```vba
CopyToClipboard Me.NodeKey.Value
```

Please note that `MSForms.DataObject` requires a reference to "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library". To add this reference:

1. Go to the VBA editor (Alt+F11)
2. Click on Tools -> References
3. Scroll down and check "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library"
4. Click OK to close the dialog.
