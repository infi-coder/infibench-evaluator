The error you're seeing is because you're trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`). Entity Framework doesn't support this. 

Indexes in Entity Framework are used to speed up the performance of data retrieval operations on a database. They can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property, you should do it like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, an index is created on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity, which is the foreign key for the `Gender` navigation property. This can help to speed up queries that filter or sort by `GenderId`.
