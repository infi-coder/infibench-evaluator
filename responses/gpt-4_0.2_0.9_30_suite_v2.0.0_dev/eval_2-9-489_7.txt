The warning you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. Without these features, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Elasticsearch configuration file (`elasticsearch.yml`). The location of this file depends on how you installed Elasticsearch. If you used Homebrew, it's likely located at `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

```yml
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

Please note that enabling security will require you to set up user authentication for Elasticsearch. You can follow the instructions in the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html) to do this.

If you don't want to enable security and just want to suppress the warning, you can add the following line to your `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yml
xpack.security.enabled: false
```

Again, save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

Remember, suppressing the warning without enabling security leaves your Elasticsearch cluster potentially open to anyone, so it's not recommended for production environments.
