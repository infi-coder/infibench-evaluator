Yes, in Flutter, you can draw vertical lines between components using the `VerticalDivider` widget. 

Here is an example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line (divider) is drawn between two text components. The `VerticalDivider` widget takes several parameters:

- `color`: This defines the color of the divider.
- `thickness`: This defines the thickness of the divider.
- `width`: This defines the total width of the divider, including the empty space on both sides of the line.

Please note that the `VerticalDivider` widget can only be used inside a `Row` widget.
