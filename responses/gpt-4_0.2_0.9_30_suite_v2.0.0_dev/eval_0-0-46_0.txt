The error message `Parsing error: Cannot read file '.../tsconfig.json'.eslint` indicates that ESLint is unable to find or read your `tsconfig.json` file. This can be caused by a few different issues, such as:

1. The `tsconfig.json` file is not in the root directory of your project.
2. The path to `tsconfig.json` in your `.eslintrc.js` file is incorrect.
3. There is a syntax error in your `tsconfig.json` file.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the `project` property in `parserOptions` as `"tsconfig.json"`. This tells ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file. If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory, you will need to provide the correct relative path.

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would need to change the `project` property to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

Here's how you can modify your `.eslintrc.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "../tsconfig.json", // change this line
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  // ...
};
```

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in a different location, adjust the path accordingly. 

If the `tsconfig.json` file is in the correct location and there are no syntax errors in it, the problem might be with your ESLint setup. You might need to install or update the `@typescript-eslint/parser` and `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` packages. You can do this with the following commands:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add --dev @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

After making these changes, restart your editor to ensure the changes are picked up.
