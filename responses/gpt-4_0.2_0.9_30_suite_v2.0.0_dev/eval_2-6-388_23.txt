The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It's part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace.

You need to install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational` package to your project. You can do this via NuGet Package Manager or by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```shell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational
```

After installing this package, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class by adding the following using directive at the top of your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Then, you can use the `[Keyless]` attribute like this:

```csharp
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    // other properties...
}
```

Remember, the `[Keyless]` attribute is used to specify that the entity type does not have any key, and it can only be used for read-only queries.
