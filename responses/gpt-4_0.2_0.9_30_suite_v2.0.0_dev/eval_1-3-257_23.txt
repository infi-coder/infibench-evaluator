Here is a Python function that divides an even number into N parts, each part being a multiple of 2:

```python
def divideNumber(num, n):
    # Calculate the base value and the remainder
    base = num // n
    rem = num % n

    # Ensure the base value is a multiple of 2
    if base % 2 != 0:
        base -= 1
        rem += n

    # Create the result list with the base value
    result = [base] * n

    # Distribute the remainder
    i = 0
    while rem > 0:
        result[i] += 2
        rem -= 2
        i = (i + 1) % n

    return result
```

This function first calculates the base value and the remainder. It then ensures that the base value is a multiple of 2. If it's not, it subtracts 1 from the base value and adds the number of parts to the remainder. Then it creates a list with the base value. Finally, it distributes the remainder by adding 2 to each part in succession.

Let's test this function with your example:

```python
print(divideNumber(100, 3))  # Output: [34, 34, 32]
```

This function works as expected.
