The comment is partially correct. 

A constructor is indeed not a regular function, but it is a special type of function in object-oriented programming languages. It is used to initialize newly created objects. 

However, the comment is incorrect in saying that a constructor cannot be called. In many programming languages, such as JavaScript, Java, or C++, constructors can be explicitly called using the `new` keyword. 

For example, in JavaScript:

```javascript
class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    console.log('Constructor was called!');
  }
}

let myObject = new MyClass(); // Outputs: 'Constructor was called!'
```

In this example, the constructor is called when a new instance of `MyClass` is created.

So, while it's true that constructors are automatically invoked when a new object is created, they can also be explicitly called by the programmer.
