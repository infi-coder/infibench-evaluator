The error message indicates that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal. If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, and XML. You can check your installed extensions by running `php -m` in your terminal. If any of these extensions are missing, you need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Although you've updated Composer to 2.3.10, it's worth double-checking the version by running `composer --version` in your terminal.

4. **Clear Composer cache**: Sometimes, Composer cache might cause problems. You can clear it by running `composer clear-cache`.

5. **Try to install Laravel again**: After ensuring all the requirements are met, try to install Laravel again with the command `composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.*"`.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about your PHP version, installed PHP extensions, and Composer version.
