## CSRF Token Mismatch

The CSRF token mismatch error could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the public directory of your Laravel application. Incorrect domain configuration could lead to issues with session handling.

2. **Cookie Configuration**: Check your `config/session.php` file and ensure that the `domain` and `path` options are correctly set. The `domain` option should match your application's domain, and the `path` option should be set to `/`.

3. **HTTPS**: If your application is served over HTTPS, ensure that the `secure` option in your `config/session.php` file is set to `true`.

4. **Middleware**: Ensure that the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is included in the `web` middleware group in your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

5. **Session Driver**: If you're using a session driver other than `file`, ensure that it's correctly configured and working as expected. If you're using the `file` driver, ensure that the `storage/framework/sessions` directory is writable by the web server.

## Email Sending Issue

The error message you're seeing suggests that there's a problem with the SSL configuration of the SMTP server you're trying to connect to. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Change Encryption Method**: Try changing the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` value in your `.env` file from `ssl` to `tls`.

2. **Change Port**: If changing the encryption method doesn't work, you could also try changing the `MAIL_PORT` value in your `.env` file to `465` (for SSL) or `25` (for TLS).

3. **Contact Server Admin**: If neither of the above solutions work, you might need to contact the administrator of the SMTP server and ask them for the correct configuration settings.

Remember to clear your config cache (`php artisan config:cache`) after making changes to your `.env` file.
