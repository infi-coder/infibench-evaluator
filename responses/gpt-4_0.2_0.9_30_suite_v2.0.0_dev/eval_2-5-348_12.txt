The error message you're seeing is due to a known issue with the way Java handles command line arguments containing spaces. When you pass a command line argument that contains a space, Java incorrectly interprets it as multiple arguments.

To fix this issue, you need to escape the spaces in your command line arguments. You can do this by adding a backslash (`\`) before each space.

Here is how you can modify your command:

```bash
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "\"\"C:\\Program\ Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd\" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path=\"C:\\Program\ Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar\" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install\""
```

However, this issue was fixed in Java 9. If you upgrade your Java version to 9 or later, you should not encounter this problem.
