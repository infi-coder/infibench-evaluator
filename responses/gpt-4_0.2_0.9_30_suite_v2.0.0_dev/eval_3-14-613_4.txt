This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being linked to the correct target. Here are some steps you can try:

1. Ensure that your SwiftUI file is a member of the target. You can check this by selecting the file in the Project Navigator and checking the File Inspector. Under "Target Membership", make sure your target is checked.

2. Clean your build folder. You can do this by going to `Product > Clean Build Folder` or by pressing `Shift + Command + K`.

3. Try to restart Xcode. Sometimes, Xcode can get into a weird state and a restart can fix it.

4. If none of the above works, try to create a new SwiftUI file and copy the code over. This can sometimes fix issues with the file itself.

If you're still having issues, it might be a bug with Xcode 12.3. You can report it to Apple through their Feedback Assistant.
