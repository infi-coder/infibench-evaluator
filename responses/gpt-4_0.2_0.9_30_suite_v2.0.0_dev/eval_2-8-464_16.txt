The error you're seeing is because AWS Lambda expects a Linux binary, but you're providing a Windows binary. AWS Lambda runs on a Linux-based environment, so you need to cross-compile your Go code for Linux.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Set the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to `linux` and `amd64` respectively. These variables tell the Go compiler to generate a binary that can run on a Linux environment.

2. Build your Go code with these environment variables.

Here's the command you can use:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o main main.go
```

This command will generate a `main` binary that can run on a Linux environment.

3. Zip the `main` binary.

```bash
zip deployment.zip main
```

4. Upload the `deployment.zip` file to AWS Lambda.

Remember to set the handler name to `main`.

Now, your AWS Lambda function should work as expected.
