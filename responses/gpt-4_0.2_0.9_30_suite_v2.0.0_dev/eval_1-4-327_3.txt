In R, you cannot have two columns with the same name in a data frame. When you try to bind two data frames with columns of the same name using `cbind()`, R will make the column names unique by adding a suffix to the duplicate column names.

In your case, the column names of `d3` will be `a` and `a.1`. So, you can select the second column by its name `a.1` like this:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

If you insist on having two columns with the same name, you can use a list instead of a data frame. But it's not recommended because it can cause confusion and errors in your code.
