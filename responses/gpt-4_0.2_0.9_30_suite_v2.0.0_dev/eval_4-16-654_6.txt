You can add your SSH key to Git Bash using the `ssh-add` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open Git Bash.

2. Navigate to the directory where your SSH key is located. In your case, it's `D:/keys folder`. You can do this using the `cd` command:

    ```bash
    cd /d/keys\ folder
    ```

3. Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent. If you named your key as `mykey.ppk`, you would do:

    ```bash
    eval $(ssh-agent -s)
    ssh-add ./mykey.ppk
    ```

Please note that `ssh-add` command might not work with PuTTY-generated keys (.ppk files). If that's the case, you need to convert your key to the OpenSSH format using PuTTYgen:

1. Open PuTTYgen.

2. Click 'Load' and select your .ppk file.

3. Once the key is loaded, go to 'Conversions' from the menu and then 'Export OpenSSH key'. Save the new OpenSSH key when prompted.

4. Now you can add this new OpenSSH key to the ssh-agent as described above.
