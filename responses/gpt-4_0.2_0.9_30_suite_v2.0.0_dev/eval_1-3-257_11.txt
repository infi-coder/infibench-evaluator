Here is a Python function that divides an even number into N parts, each part being a multiple of 2:

```python
def divideNumber(num, n):
    # Calculate the base value and the remainder
    base = num // n
    rem = num % n

    # Ensure that the base value is a multiple of 2
    if base % 2 != 0:
        base -= 1
        rem += n

    # Create the result list with the base value
    result = [base] * n

    # Distribute the remainder
    for i in range(0, rem, 2):
        result[i // 2] += 2

    return result
```

This function first calculates the base value and the remainder of the division. Then it ensures that the base value is a multiple of 2 by subtracting 1 and adding the number of parts to the remainder if necessary. After that, it creates a list with the base value and distributes the remainder by adding 2 to each part in succession.

Let's test this function with your example:

```python
print(divideNumber(100, 3))  # Output: [34, 34, 32]
```

This function works as expected and gives the correct output.
