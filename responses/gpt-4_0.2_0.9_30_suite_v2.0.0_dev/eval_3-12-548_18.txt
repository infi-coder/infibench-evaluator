Use `WillPopScope` instead of `Navigator.pop(context)` or `Navigator.of(context).pop()`. 

`WillPopScope` is a widget that detects when the user has pressed the back button on their device and calls a specified function. In your case, you can use it to prevent the user from going back to the previous screen after they've logged out. Here's an example:

```dart
return WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () async => false, // prevent the user from going back
  child: Scaffold(
    // your login page code here
  ),
);
```

In the `onWillPop` function, returning `false` means "do not allow pop", effectively disabling the back button.
