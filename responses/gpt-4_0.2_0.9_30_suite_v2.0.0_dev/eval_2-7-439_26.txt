The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling ZIP archives. This extension is not a Composer package, so you can't install it using `composer require`.

You need to install it using the PHP extension installation method for your specific operating system.

For example, if you are using Ubuntu, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you are using Windows, you can enable it in your `php.ini` file by uncommenting or adding the following line:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing or enabling the extension, you can check if it's enabled by using the following command:

```bash
php -m | grep zip
```

If the extension is enabled, you should see `zip` in the output.

After you've installed the extension, you can tell Composer that it's installed by adding it to the `require` section of your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1.3",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer update` to update your project dependencies.

Remember to replace `"php": "^7.1.3"` with your actual PHP version.
