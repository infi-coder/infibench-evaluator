The issue you're experiencing could be due to a couple of reasons. Here are some steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check the URL**: Starting from version 1.3.9 of springdoc-openapi-ui, the default URL has been changed from `/swagger-ui.html` to `/swagger-ui/index.html`. So, try accessing the Swagger UI using the URL `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.

2. **Check your Spring Boot version**: You mentioned that you're using Spring Boot v3, but as of now, there's no such version. Spring Boot's latest stable release is 2.6.1 (as of December 2021). Please make sure you're using a compatible version of Spring Boot with springdoc-openapi-ui.

3. **Check your application properties**: If you have changed the default context path, servlet path or server port, you need to include those in your Swagger UI URL. For example, if you have `server.servlet.context-path=/api` in your `application.properties`, then the Swagger UI URL would be `http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/index.html`.

4. **Check your Spring Security configuration**: If you're using Spring Security, you need to permit all requests to `/swagger-ui/**` and `/v3/api-docs/**` paths. Here's an example:

    ```java
    @Configuration
    public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
        @Override
        protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
            http.authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/swagger-ui/**", "/v3/api-docs/**").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated();
        }
    }
    ```

5. **Check your project setup**: Make sure that you've correctly set up your project. You should have the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation on your main class, and you should run this class to start your application.

If you've checked all of these and you're still having issues, please provide more details about your setup and I'll be glad to help further.
