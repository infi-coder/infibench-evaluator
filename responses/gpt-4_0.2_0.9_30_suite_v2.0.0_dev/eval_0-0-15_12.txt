Sure, the issue is that you are returning an object instead of a function that returns an object. The `new` keyword in JavaScript is used to create an instance of a class, which is a function. Here's how you can revise your code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  // Returns a function
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

Now, when you call `new API()`, it will return the mocked object.
