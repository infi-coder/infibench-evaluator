The error message indicates that Xcode is unable to find the SwiftUI preview in any of your project's targets. Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your scheme settings**: Ensure that your scheme is set to build your target. You can do this by going to `Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme > Build` and making sure your target is in the list and checked.

2. **Clean your build folder**: Sometimes, cleaning the build folder can resolve this issue. You can do this by going to `Product > Clean Build Folder`.

3. **Restart Xcode**: Sometimes, simply restarting Xcode can resolve this issue.

4. **Check your preview code**: Make sure your preview code is inside the same file as the `ContentView` and it's not inside any `#if DEBUG` or similar conditional compilation block.

5. **Update your Swift package dependencies**: If you're using any Swift packages, make sure they are up-to-date. You can do this by going to `File > Swift Packages > Update to Latest Package Versions`.

6. **Reinstall Xcode**: If none of the above solutions work, you might want to consider reinstalling Xcode.
