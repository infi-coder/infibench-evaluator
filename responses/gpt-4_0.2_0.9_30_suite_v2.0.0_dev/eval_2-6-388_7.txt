The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It's part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace.

You need to make sure that you have the correct version of Entity Framework Core installed in your project, as the `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in EF Core 5.0.

To install or update EF Core, you can use the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```shell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -Version 5.0.0
```

After installing or updating EF Core, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute by adding the following using directive at the top of your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Then you can use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class like this:

```csharp
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    // other properties...
}
```

And in your `DbContext`:

```csharp
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

Now you should be able to use `_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)` without having to add a primary key to your `MyKeylessClass` model.
