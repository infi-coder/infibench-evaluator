Your Dockerfile seems correct, but the error message suggests that the Python interpreter cannot find the `app` module. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The `app` directory is not correctly copied into the Docker image.
2. The Python interpreter is not looking in the correct directory for your `app` module.

Here's a revised version of your Dockerfile that might help:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8

# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 8000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the command to start uvicorn
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]
```

This Dockerfile assumes that your `requirements.txt` file is in the same directory as your Dockerfile. If it's not, you'll need to adjust the `COPY` command accordingly.

Also, make sure your `docker-compose.yml` file has the correct build context set. It should look something like this:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

This tells Docker Compose to build the Dockerfile in the current directory (denoted by the `.`) and map port 8000 of the container to port 8000 of the host machine.
