Yes, in Flutter, you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here is a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 2'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 3'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, `VerticalDivider` is used to draw vertical lines between three text widgets. You can customize the color, thickness, and width of the divider.

Please note that `VerticalDivider` is a widget that displays a vertical line with a thickness you specify. It's always centered within its parent widget. If you want the line to take the full height, you should wrap it with an `Expanded` or `Flexible` widget.
