In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, the column names of the second data frame are modified to make them unique. The column names are appended with a suffix like `.1`, `.2`, etc. 

In your case, you can select the second column named `a` by using `d3$a.1`. Here is how you can assign the second column to a variable named `second_col`:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

Please note that the column names might be different based on the order of binding and the number of similar columns. You can always check the column names of a data frame using `colnames()` function:

```r
colnames(d3)
```

This will give you the exact names of the columns in your data frame.
