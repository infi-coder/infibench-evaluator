The error message you're seeing is indicating that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version is not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are the server requirements for Laravel 9:

- PHP >= 8.0
- BCMath PHP Extension
- Ctype PHP Extension
- Fileinfo PHP extension
- JSON PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension

Please make sure your PHP version is 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -v
```

If your PHP version is less than 8.0, you need to upgrade it.

Also, ensure that you have all the necessary PHP extensions installed. You can check your installed extensions by running:

```bash
php -m
```

If any extensions are missing, you will need to install them.

Finally, make sure your Composer is up to date. Laravel 9 requires Composer version 2.0.13 or higher. You can check your Composer version by running:

```bash
composer --version
```

If your Composer version is less than 2.0.13, you can update it by running:

```bash
composer self-update
```

After ensuring all these requirements are met, try running the `composer create-project` command again.
