The comment is partially correct. A constructor is indeed a special method in a class that is automatically invoked when a new object is created. However, saying "a constructor cannot be called" is not entirely accurate. 

In many programming languages like JavaScript, Java, C++, etc., a constructor is indeed a special type of function/method that is used to initialize a new object of that class. While it's true that constructors are automatically called when an object is instantiated, they can also be called manually in certain circumstances.

For example, in JavaScript, you can call a constructor manually using the `call` or `apply` methods. In Java, you can use the `new` keyword to call a constructor and create a new object. 

So, while the comment is correct in the sense that constructors are automatically invoked during object creation, it's not entirely accurate to say that they cannot be called like functions.
