It seems like you're trying to retrieve the local path of a file stored on OneDrive using VBA. Unfortunately, Excel does not provide a direct way to retrieve the local path of a file stored on OneDrive. 

However, you can use the `Environ` function in VBA to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. Here's a simple example:

```vba
Sub GetOneDrivePath()
    Dim OneDrivePath As String
    OneDrivePath = Environ("OneDrive")
    MsgBox OneDrivePath
End Sub
```

This will return the path to the root of the OneDrive folder. If you know the relative path from the OneDrive root to your file, you can append it to `OneDrivePath`.

Please note that this method assumes that the user has set up OneDrive to sync files to their local machine. If the files are not synced, they will not be accessible via the local file system.

Also, keep in mind that the path to the OneDrive folder can be different on different machines, so this solution might not work for all users. 

If you need to create folders and files on SharePoint using VBA, you might need to use the SharePoint REST API or the Microsoft Graph API, but this would be a more complex solution and would require a good understanding of these APIs.
