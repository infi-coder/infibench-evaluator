You can use the `now()` function provided by Laravel to get the current date and time. Here is how you can modify your function:

```php
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array("name" => $name, "address" => $address, "created_at" => now(), "updated_at" => now());
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

In this code, `now()` will return the current date and time. This will be stored in the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields in the database.

However, if you are using Laravel's Eloquent ORM and have the `$timestamps` property set to `true` in your model (which is the default), you don't need to manually set the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields. Laravel will automatically set these for you when you create or update a model.
