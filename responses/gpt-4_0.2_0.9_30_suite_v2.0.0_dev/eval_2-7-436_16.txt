The error message suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version is not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are the steps to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    php -v
    ```
    If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, and XML. You can check your installed extensions by running:

    ```bash
    php -m
    ```
    If any of the required extensions are missing, you need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Although you've mentioned that you've updated Composer to 2.3.10, it's good to double-check. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    composer --version
    ```
    If your Composer version is not up-to-date, you need to update it.

4. **Clear Composer cache**: Sometimes, the Composer cache can cause issues. Clear it by running:

    ```bash
    composer clear-cache
    ```
    Then try to create the Laravel project again.

5. **Check Laravel version**: Make sure that Laravel 9 is released and available for installation. At the time of writing this response, Laravel 9 has not been released yet. You can check the latest Laravel version on the [Laravel GitHub page](https://github.com/laravel/laravel).

If you've checked all of these and you're still having issues, please provide more information about your environment (PHP version, installed PHP extensions, operating system, etc.) so we can help you better.
