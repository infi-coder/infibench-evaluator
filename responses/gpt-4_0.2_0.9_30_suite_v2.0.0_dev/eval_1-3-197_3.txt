Here is a Python function using pandas that does what you want. It uses the `itertools.cycle` function to repeat your list indefinitely, and then uses the `islice` function to take only as many elements as there are in your DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd
from itertools import cycle, islice

def fillColumn(df, columnName, columnData):
    df[columnName] = list(islice(cycle(columnData), len(df)))
    return df
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
my_list = ['abc','def','hig']
df = fillColumn(df, 'names', my_list)
```

This will fill the 'names' column of the DataFrame `df` with the values in `my_list`, repeating them as necessary until all rows in the DataFrame are filled.
