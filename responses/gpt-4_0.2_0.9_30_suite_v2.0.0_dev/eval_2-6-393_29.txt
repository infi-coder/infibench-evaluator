The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. In Entity Framework, an index can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties. 

In your case, `Gender` is a navigation property in the `User` entity. If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property, you should do so like this:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `HasIndex(x => x.GenderId)` creates an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity.
