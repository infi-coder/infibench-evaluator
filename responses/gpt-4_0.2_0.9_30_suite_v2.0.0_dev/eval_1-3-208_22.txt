The issue with your code is that you're checking if the entire input string is within the `correct` string, not if each individual character is within `correct`. 

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)
```

This function uses the `all()` function, which returns `True` if all elements in the given iterable are true. The iterable in this case is a generator expression that checks if each character in the text is in the `correct` string. If any character is not in `correct`, `all()` will return `False`.
