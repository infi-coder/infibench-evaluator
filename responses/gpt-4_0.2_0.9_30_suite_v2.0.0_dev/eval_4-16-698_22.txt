You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, those changes will be applied to your current terminal session.

If you're using a different shell like zsh, you might have a `.zshrc` file instead. In that case, you would use:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Remember that these changes will only apply to your current terminal session. If you open a new terminal window or tab, you'll need to source the file again.
