The `sourceMap` option in `tsconfig.json` is used to control whether source maps should be generated for your TypeScript files during the compilation process.

Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. They are very useful during the debugging process. When you have an error in your JavaScript code, the browser's debugger can use the source map to show you the error in the original TypeScript code instead of the compiled JavaScript code.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, then these source map files will not be generated. This means that if you have an error in your JavaScript code, the browser's debugger will show you the error in the JavaScript code, not in the original TypeScript code. This can make debugging more difficult, especially if you're not familiar with the JavaScript code that TypeScript generates.

However, setting `"sourceMap": false` can also make your build process faster and your output directory cleaner, because you're not generating extra files. This might be desirable in a production environment, where you don't need to debug your code and you want to keep your deployed codebase as small as possible.

In summary, the actual change when you set `"sourceMap": false` is that source maps are not generated during the TypeScript compilation process. This can affect debugging and the size and cleanliness of your output directory.
