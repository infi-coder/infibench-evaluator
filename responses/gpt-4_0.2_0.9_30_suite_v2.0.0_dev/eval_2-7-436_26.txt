The error message you're seeing is typically due to a mismatch between the PHP version you're using and the PHP version required by Laravel 9. Laravel 9 requires PHP version 8.0 or higher.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    php -v
    ```
    If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

2. **Upgrade your PHP version**. The process for this will depend on your operating system and your current PHP setup. If you're using a package manager like Homebrew on macOS, you can use the following commands:

    ```bash
    brew unlink php
    brew install php@8.0
    brew link php@8.0
    ```

    On Ubuntu, you can use these commands:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y php8.0
    ```

3. **Check your Composer version**. Laravel 9 requires Composer version 2.0.8 or higher. You can check your Composer version by running:

    ```bash
    composer --version
    ```

    If your Composer version is lower than 2.0.8, you can upgrade it by running:

    ```bash
    composer self-update
    ```

4. **Try creating the Laravel project again**. Once your PHP and Composer versions are up to date, you should be able to create a new Laravel 9 project with the command you were using:

    ```bash
    composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.*"
    ```

If you're still having trouble after following these steps, there might be an issue with your PHP extensions. Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, and XML. You can check which extensions you have installed by running `php -m` in your terminal.
