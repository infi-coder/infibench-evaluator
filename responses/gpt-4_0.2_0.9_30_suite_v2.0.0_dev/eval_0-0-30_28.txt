Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17, `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. You can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can update your import code to use this adapter:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Please note that this is an unofficial adapter and may not support all features or have the same stability as the official adapters. The official adapter for React 17 from Enzyme is not yet available at the time of writing.
