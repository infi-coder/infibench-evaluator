Yes, in Flutter you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here is a basic example of how you can use it:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line is drawn between two text components. The `VerticalDivider` widget allows you to specify the color and thickness of the line. 

Note that the `VerticalDivider` is a widget itself, so it takes up space in the layout. If you want a line that doesn't take up any space, you can use a `Container` with a border instead.
