This error is caused by the incompatibility between the Maven version (3.8.5) used by the Spring Boot 2.7 project and the Maven version supported by your IntelliJ IDEA.

The error message `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.maven.model.validation.DefaultModelValidator: method 'void <init>()' not found` indicates that IntelliJ is trying to use a method in the `DefaultModelValidator` class that doesn't exist in the Maven version you're using.

To resolve this issue, you have two options:

1. **Downgrade the Maven version in your project**: You can change the Maven version in your project to a version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by modifying the `pom.xml` file in your project. Here is an example of how to do it:

```xml
<properties>
    <maven.version>3.8.1</maven.version>
</properties>
```

2. **Upgrade your IntelliJ IDEA**: If you don't want to change the Maven version in your project, you can upgrade your IntelliJ IDEA to a version that supports Maven 3.8.5. You can do this by going to `Help > Check for Updates...` in your IntelliJ IDEA.

Remember to re-import your project after making these changes.
