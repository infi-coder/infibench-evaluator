Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs. It doesn't directly support child or descendant selectors like traditional CSS. 

However, you can use JavaScript or jQuery to select direct children of a div with class "section". Here's an example using jQuery:

```javascript
$(".section > div").each(function() {
  // your code here
});
```

If you want to apply Tailwind CSS styles to these children, you can do so within the function:

```javascript
$(".section > div").each(function() {
  $(this).addClass('your-tailwind-classes');
});
```

Remember to replace `'your-tailwind-classes'` with the actual Tailwind CSS classes you want to apply.

Alternatively, you can create a custom CSS class in your stylesheet and use Tailwind's `@apply` directive to apply a set of styles, then use JavaScript or jQuery to add this class to the direct children:

```css
.yourClass {
  @apply your-tailwind-classes;
}
```

```javascript
$(".section > div").addClass('yourClass');
```

Again, replace `'your-tailwind-classes'` and `'yourClass'` with your actual class names.
