The issue is with the single quotes around `$searchT` in your `grep` command. In bash, single quotes preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes. This means that `$searchT` is not being interpreted as a variable, but as a literal string. 

To fix this, you should use double quotes instead. Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

This script will now correctly interpret `$searchT` as a variable and substitute its value into the `grep` command.
