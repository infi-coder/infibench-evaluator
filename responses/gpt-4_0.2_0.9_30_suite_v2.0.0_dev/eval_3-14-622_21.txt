To conform to `ShapeStyle` in SwiftUI, you need to create a struct that conforms to the `ShapeStyle` protocol. This protocol requires you to implement a `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType)`. 

Here is how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        shape.fill = Color.red
    }
}
```

Please note that `ShapeStyle` is a protocol mainly used by SwiftUI internally, and its methods are underscored, which means they're not meant to be used directly. It's generally recommended to use the provided conformances like `Color`, `Gradient`, etc. instead of creating your own.
