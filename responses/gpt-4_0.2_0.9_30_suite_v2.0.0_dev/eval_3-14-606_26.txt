The alert you're seeing is likely related to the fact that the app you're trying to open is a developer-signed app, not a standard App Store app. To run such apps, you need to trust the developer on your device. Here's how you can do that:

1. Go to **Settings** on your iOS device.
2. Scroll down and tap on **General**.
3. Scroll down to **Device Management** or **Profiles & Device Management**.
4. Under the "Developer App" section, tap on the developer's name.
5. Then tap on **Trust "[Developer Name]"**.
6. In the pop-up prompt, confirm by tapping **Trust**.

Please note that you should only trust apps from developers you know and trust.

However, if you're trying to enable the actual "Developer Mode" for more advanced development-related tasks, you need to connect your device to a Mac and use Xcode. Here's how:

1. Install **Xcode** from the Mac App Store.
2. Connect your iOS device to your Mac using a USB cable.
3. Open **Xcode** and go to **Window** > **Devices and Simulators**.
4. Select your device from the list in the left sidebar.
5. Check the box that says "Show as run destination".

Please note that enabling Developer Mode in this way is typically only necessary for developers who need to run and test apps directly on a device. If you're not a developer, you likely don't need to enable Developer Mode.
