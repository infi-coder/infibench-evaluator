Sure, you can use the `&` operator to combine the two mapped types into one. Here's how you can define the `FruitsAndColors` type:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This type will have a numeric property for each fruit and a boolean property for each color.
