The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. Therefore, you cannot install it using `composer require`.

The `ext-zip` extension is used for zip file manipulations in PHP. If you're getting an error that it's missing, it means you need to install it on your PHP installation.

The installation process depends on your operating system.

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**

You can install it via `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

**For CentOS/RHEL:**

You can install it via `yum`:

```bash
sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
```

**For MacOS:**

If you're using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install php@7.4
brew link --overwrite --force php@7.4
```

**For Windows:**

1. Find your `php.ini` file (you can check the location by running `php --ini`).
2. Open `php.ini` in a text editor.
3. Find the line `;extension=php_zip.dll`.
4. Uncomment this line by removing the `;` at the start.
5. Save and close `php.ini`.
6. Restart your web server.

After installing the extension, you can confirm it's installed by running:

```bash
php -m | grep zip
```

If it's installed, you should see `zip` in the output.

After you've installed the `ext-zip` extension, you can then tell Composer that it's installed by adding it to the `require` section of your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer install` again.
