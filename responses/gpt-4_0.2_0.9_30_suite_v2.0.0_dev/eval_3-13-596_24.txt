The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` is generated by the `bootJar` task in Spring Boot 2.5.0. If you don't want to generate it, you can disable this task in your `build.gradle` file.

Add the following lines to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will disable the `bootJar` task and prevent the generation of the `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` file.
