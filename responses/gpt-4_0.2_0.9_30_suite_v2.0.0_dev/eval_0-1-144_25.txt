The accordion arrow in Bootstrap 5 is actually a background SVG image. To change its color, you need to override the CSS for the `.accordion-button::after` pseudo-element. 

Here is an example of how you can change the color to green:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is expanded */
    background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 16 16'%3e%3cpath fill='none' stroke='%2300FF00' stroke-linecap='round' stroke-linejoin='round' stroke-width='2' d='M2 6l6 6 6-6'/%3e%3c/svg%3e");
}

.accordion-button::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is collapsed */
    background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 16 16'%3e%3cpath fill='none' stroke='%2300FF00' stroke-linecap='round' stroke-linejoin='round' stroke-width='2' d='M2 9l6-6 6 6'/%3e%3c/svg%3e");
}
```

In this example, `%2300FF00` is the URL-encoded version of `#00FF00`, which is the hex color code for green. You can replace this with any color you want.

Please note that you need to include this CSS after the Bootstrap CSS in your HTML file, so that it overrides the default Bootstrap styles.
