The error message you're seeing is typically caused by an HTTP request that is not returning valid JSON. The '<' character at the start of the response suggests that you might be getting an HTML error page instead.

First, ensure that your API is working correctly by testing the endpoint (`/api/Employee/Index`) directly in a browser or using a tool like Postman. If you see an HTML error page, you'll need to fix the error on the server side before you can proceed.

If the API is working correctly, the issue might be with the URL you're using in the Blazor app. The URL `/api/Employee/Index` is relative, and it might not be resolving to the correct location. Try using an absolute URL instead:

```c#
empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("http://localhost:5000/api/Employee/Index");
```

Replace `http://localhost:5000` with the actual address of your server.

Also, note that the `GetJsonAsync` method is obsolete in .NET 5.0 and later. If you're using .NET 5.0 or later, use `GetFromJsonAsync` instead:

```c#
empList = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<Employee[]>("http://localhost:5000/api/Employee/Index");
```

Finally, your route attribute in the API controller is not correct. You have defined the route as `[Route("[controller]")]` and then again as `[Route("api/Employee/Index")]` for the `Index` action. This would result in a route like `Employee/api/Employee/Index`, which is not what you want. 

You should define the route at the controller level as `[Route("api/[controller]")]` and then just use `[HttpGet]` for the `Index` action:

```c#
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class EmployeeController : ControllerBase
{
    EmployeeRepository objemployee = new EmployeeRepository();

    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Employee> Index()
    {
        return objemployee.GetAllEmployees();
    }
}
```

This will result in the correct route `api/Employee`.
