The error message indicates that npm is unable to find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry. This is because there is no package with the name `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry.

If you are trying to install the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js, the correct package name is `aws-sdk`. You can install it by running:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

Please replace `aws-sdk-js` with `aws-sdk` in your `package.json` file or in your install command, and try again.
