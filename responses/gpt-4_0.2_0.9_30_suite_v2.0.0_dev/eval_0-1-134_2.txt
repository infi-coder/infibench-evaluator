It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow. 

For example, in HTML, if you type `.classname` and press `Tab`, it will automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`. 

If this isn't working for you, it's possible that either:

1. You're not using a text editor that supports Emmet, or
2. Emmet is not installed or enabled in your text editor.

If you're using a text editor like Visual Studio Code, Emmet is built-in and enabled by default. If you're using a different text editor, you may need to install it separately.

Here's how you can check if Emmet is working in Visual Studio Code:

1. Open a new `.html` file.
2. Type `!` and then press `Tab`. This should expand to a basic HTML boilerplate.
3. If it doesn't, Emmet may not be working correctly.

If you're using a different text editor, you may need to look up specific instructions on how to install or enable Emmet.
