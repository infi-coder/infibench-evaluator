The error message you're seeing is due to a known issue with Java 8u20 and later versions on Windows. The issue is that Java now rejects command lines that contain embedded quotes.

The solution is to upgrade your NetBeans to a version that includes a fix for this issue. NetBeans 11.3 and later versions include a fix for this issue.

Here are the steps to upgrade NetBeans:

1. Download the latest version of NetBeans from the official website. You can download it from here: [NetBeans Official Website](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html)

2. Uninstall the old version of NetBeans. You can do this by going to `Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features`, select `NetBeans`, and click on `Uninstall`.

3. Install the new version of NetBeans that you just downloaded. Just follow the installation wizard.

4. After the installation is complete, try to build your project again.

If you still encounter the same issue after upgrading NetBeans, please let me know.
