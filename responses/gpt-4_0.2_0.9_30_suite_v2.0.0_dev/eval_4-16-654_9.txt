You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by following these steps:

1. Open Git Bash.

2. Execute the following command to ensure ssh-agent is running:

    ```bash
    eval $(ssh-agent -s)
    ```

3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace `id_rsa` in the command with the name of your private key file.

    ```bash
    ssh-add D:/keys/id_rsa
    ```

Now your SSH key has been added to Git Bash and you should be able to clone your repository.

Please note that the key must be in OpenSSH format. If you generated your key with PuttyGen, you might need to convert it to OpenSSH format. You can do this with PuttyGen by opening your key and then going to `Conversions > Export OpenSSH key`.
