The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. This means you can't install it using Composer. Instead, you need to install it on your system where PHP is installed.

Here are the steps to install the `ext-zip` extension:

### For Ubuntu/Debian

1. Update package lists for upgrades and new package installations:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

2. Install the `ext-zip` extension:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install php-zip
    ```

### For CentOS/RHEL

1. Install the `ext-zip` extension:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
    ```

### For Windows

1. Open your `php.ini` file.

2. Uncomment the line (i.e., remove the semicolon) that reads:

    ```bash
    ;extension=php_zip.dll
    ```

    So it should look like this:

    ```bash
    extension=php_zip.dll
    ```

3. Save the `php.ini` file and restart your web server.

After installing the extension, you can require it in your `composer.json` file like this:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": ">=7.1.3",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer install` again.
