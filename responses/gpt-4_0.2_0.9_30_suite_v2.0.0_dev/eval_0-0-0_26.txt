Sure, here is a function that does exactly that:

```javascript
function keys_and_prices(raw_obj) {
    let keys = Object.keys(raw_obj);
    let prices = keys.map(key => raw_obj[key].price);
    return [keys, prices];
}
```

This function first extracts the keys from the object using `Object.keys()`. Then it maps over these keys and for each key, it accesses the corresponding `price` field in the original object. Finally, it returns an array containing the keys and prices arrays.

You can use it like this:

```javascript
var itemsToBuy = { milk: { quantity : 5, price: 20 }, bread: { quantity : 2, price: 15 }, potato: { quantity : 3, price: 10 } }
let ret = keys_and_prices(itemsToBuy)
console.log(ret[0]) // ["milk", "bread", "potato"]
console.log(ret[1]) // [20, 15, 10]
```

Please note that the order of keys and prices in the returned arrays depends on the order of properties in the original object, which is not guaranteed in JavaScript. If you need a specific order, you might need to sort the keys array before mapping it to prices.
