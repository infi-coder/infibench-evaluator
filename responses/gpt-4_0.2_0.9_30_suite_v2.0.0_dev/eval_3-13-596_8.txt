The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` file is generated due to the new feature in Spring Boot 2.5.0 that creates a "plain" jar alongside the executable jar. If you want to disable this feature, you can add the following configuration to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}

jar {
    enabled = true
}
```

This will only generate the `myprogram-0.0.1.jar` file.
