The `f` in `print(f"...")` is used for f-string formatting in Python. It's a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`. The expressions will be replaced with their values. The letter "f" also indicates that these strings are of type `f-string`.

In your example:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

The `{args.input_directory}` and `{args.output_directory}` inside the f-strings are expressions that get evaluated and their results are inserted into the string. If `args.input_directory` is `/home/user/input` and `args.output_directory` is `/home/user/output`, the output will be:

```
Input directory: /home/user/input
Output directory: /home/user/output
```

This is a very handy feature in Python 3.6 and later, as it makes formatting strings much easier and more readable.
