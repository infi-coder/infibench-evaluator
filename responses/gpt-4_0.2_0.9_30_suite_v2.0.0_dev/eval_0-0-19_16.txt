The error message you're seeing indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` cannot be found in the npm registry. This is because the package name is incorrect. 

The correct package name for the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`. 

You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

This should resolve the issue you're experiencing.
