You can use `awk` to extract the language code. Here's how you can modify your command:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | head -1 | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'
```

Here's what this command does:

- `curl -Ls stick-it.app`: Fetches the content of the webpage.
- `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'`: Searches for the `lang` attribute and its value. The `-o` option tells `grep` to only output the part of the line that matches the pattern.
- `head -1`: Selects the first line of output, in case there are multiple `lang` attributes.
- `awk -F'"' '{print $2}'`: Splits the line on the `"` character and prints the second field, which is the language code.

This command will work regardless of how many spaces there are around the `=` sign in the `lang` attribute, and it will correctly handle language codes that include a hyphen.
