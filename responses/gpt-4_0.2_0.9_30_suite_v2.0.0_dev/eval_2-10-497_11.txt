In Rust, you can't have a null `Box<T>`. If you want to have a nullable pointer, you should use `Option<Box<T>>`. This way, you can use `None` to represent a null pointer. Here is how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

Now, you can check if `top` is a null pointer by checking if it's `None`:

```rust
if self.top.is_none() {
    // top is a null pointer
} else {
    // top is not a null pointer
}
```

Or you can use pattern matching:

```rust
match self.top {
    Some(_) => {
        // top is not a null pointer
    },
    None => {
        // top is a null pointer
    }
}
```

This is more idiomatic in Rust and prevents null pointer dereferencing, which is a common source of bugs in other languages.
