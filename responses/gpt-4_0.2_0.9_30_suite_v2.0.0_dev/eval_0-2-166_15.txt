In Tailwind CSS, you don't directly select elements like you do in traditional CSS. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework where you apply pre-existing classes directly to your HTML.

If you want to style direct children of a div with a class "section", you would apply the styles directly to the child elements in your HTML.

For example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-red-500"> <!-- Apply your styles here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="text-xl"> <!-- Apply your styles here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-red-500` and `text-xl` are Tailwind CSS utility classes applied directly to the child divs.

If you need to apply styles based on parent-child relationships, you might need to use traditional CSS or preprocessors like Sass, Less etc. alongside Tailwind.
