The error message indicates that the Pillow library could not be installed because the zlib library, which is a required dependency, could not be found. 

However, the Pillow version you are trying to install (6.0.0) does not support Python 3.8, which is the Python version you are using. This is mentioned in the error message:

```bash
C:\Users\rijal\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-install-di5is9gd\Pillow\setup.py:29: RuntimeWarning: Pillow does not yet support Python 3.8 and does not yet provide prebuilt Windows binaries. We do not recommend building from source on Windows.
```

To solve this issue, you should install a more recent version of Pillow that supports Python 3.8. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pillow
```

This command will install the latest version of Pillow, which should be compatible with Python 3.8.

If you still encounter issues, it might be due to the fact that the zlib library is not installed on your system. In this case, you should install it. However, this is usually not necessary on Windows, as Python comes with zlib included.
