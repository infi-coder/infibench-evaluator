Your code is correct, but the problem might be that you're not seeing the changes because you're testing it in the `ContentView_Previews`. The `@State` variable `selected` in `ContentView_Previews` is not persisting its state when the button is clicked.

To see the changes, you need to use your `ContentView` in a parent view that maintains the state of `isSelected`. Here's an example:

```swift
struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var isSelected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $isSelected)
    }
}
```

Now, use `ParentView` in your app's main entry point or wherever you want to use it. The `isSelected` state will now persist and you'll see the changes when the button is clicked.
