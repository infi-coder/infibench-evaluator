This error is due to a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version that comes with Spring Boot 2.7.0. The Maven version 3.8.5 is not fully compatible with some versions of IntelliJ IDEA.

Here are some possible solutions:

1. **Downgrade Maven version**: You can manually downgrade the Maven version in your project to a version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by modifying the `pom.xml` file in your project. Change the Maven version in the `properties` section to a lower version (e.g., 3.8.4 or lower).

2. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: JetBrains usually releases updates to IntelliJ IDEA to fix such compatibility issues. You can check if there is an update available for IntelliJ IDEA and install it.

3. **Use IntelliJ IDEA's bundled Maven**: IntelliJ IDEA comes with a bundled Maven that is guaranteed to be compatible. You can switch to using this version. To do this, go to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven`. Under `Maven home directory`, select the bundled Maven.

4. **Disable the Maven extension in IntelliJ IDEA**: If you don't need the Maven integration in IntelliJ IDEA, you can disable the Maven plugin. Go to `File -> Settings -> Plugins`, find the Maven plugin, and disable it.

Remember to re-import your project or restart IntelliJ IDEA after making these changes.
