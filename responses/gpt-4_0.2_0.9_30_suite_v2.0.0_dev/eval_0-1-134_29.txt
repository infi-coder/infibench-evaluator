It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a web-developerâ€™s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow: it allows you to type CSS-like expressions that can be dynamically parsed and produce output depending on what you type in the abbreviation.

For example, in an HTML file if you type `.classname`, and then press `Tab`, it should expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, it could be due to a few reasons:

1. **You're not using a code editor that supports Emmet.** Emmet is built into many code editors, like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Brackets, Atom, and more. If you're using a plain text editor, or an editor that doesn't support Emmet, this feature won't work.

2. **Emmet is not enabled.** If you're using a code editor that supports Emmet, make sure it's enabled. In Visual Studio Code, for example, you can check this by going to `File -> Preferences -> Settings` and searching for Emmet.

3. **You're not in an HTML file.** Emmet usually only works in HTML files. Make sure your file is saved with an `.html` extension, and that your code editor recognizes it as an HTML file.

4. **You're not pressing the right key.** After typing the Emmet abbreviation, you need to press `Tab` to expand it. If you're pressing a different key, it won't work.

If you've checked all these things and it's still not working, you might want to look for specific instructions for your code editor on how to enable or use Emmet.
