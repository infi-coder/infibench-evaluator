To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement a method that provides a `Shader` when given a `Rect`. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedStyle())
    }
}

struct RedStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        // Implementation here
    }
    
    func _makeView(geometry: _GraphValue<_ShapeStyle_ShapeType>, inputs: _ViewInputs) -> _ViewOutputs {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

However, these methods are underscored, which means they're not intended for public use. SwiftUI doesn't provide a public API for creating custom `ShapeStyle`s. Therefore, it's recommended to use the existing `ShapeStyle`s like `Color`, `Gradient`, etc., or create a custom `View` that draws your shape.
