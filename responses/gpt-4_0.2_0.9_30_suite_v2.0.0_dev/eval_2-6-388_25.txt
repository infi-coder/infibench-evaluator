The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It is part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

You need to install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational` package to your project. You can do this via NuGet Package Manager or by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```shell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational
```

After installing the package, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute by adding the following using directive to your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Then you can use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class:

```csharp
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    // ...
}
```

And in your `DbContext`:

```csharp
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

Now you should be able to use `_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)` without having to add a primary key to your model.
