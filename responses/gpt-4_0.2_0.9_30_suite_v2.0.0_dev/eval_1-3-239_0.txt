Sure, here is a bash script that will install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current version of Python
brew unlink python

# Install the required version
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed version
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please replace `3.6` with `3.6.5` if you specifically want Python `3.6.5`. However, please note that Homebrew does not maintain all minor versions, so `3.6` might be the closest you can get. 

Also, remember to make the script executable by running `chmod +x scriptname.sh` before executing it.
