## CSRF Token Mismatch

The CSRF token mismatch issue could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the public directory of your Laravel application. Misconfiguration could lead to issues with session handling.

2. **Cookie Configuration**: Check your `config/session.php` file and ensure that the `domain` and `path` options are correctly set. If your application is on a subdomain, you might need to set the `domain` option to your root domain preceded by a dot (e.g., `.yourdomain.com`).

3. **HTTPS**: If your application is being served over HTTPS on your domain, ensure that the `secure` option in your `config/session.php` file is set to `true`.

4. **Session Driver**: If you're using a driver other than `file` for sessions, ensure that it's correctly configured and working as expected.

## SMTP Connection Error

The error you're getting indicates that there's an issue with the SSL configuration. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Encryption Method**: Try changing the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` in your `.env` file from `ssl` to `tls`. Some servers may not support SSL for SMTP.

2. **Port Number**: The port number you're using (587) is typically used with `tls`. If you're using `ssl`, the port number should typically be 465. So, if you stick with `ssl`, try changing `MAIL_PORT` to 465.

3. **Server Configuration**: It's possible that the server requires specific SSL settings. You might need to get in touch with the server administrator or the service provider for the correct settings.

Remember to clear your config cache (`php artisan config:cache`) after making changes to your `.env` file or config files.
