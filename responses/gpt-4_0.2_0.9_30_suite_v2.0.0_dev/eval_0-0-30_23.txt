Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17 called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. You can install it using npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can modify your import code to use this adapter:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

This should allow you to use Enzyme with React 17.0.1. However, please note that this is an unofficial adapter and may not support all features or have the same level of support as the official adapters.
