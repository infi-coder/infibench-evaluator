The error you're getting is because the value '2021.0' is a string representation of a float, not an integer. You can't directly convert it to an integer using `int()`. You need to convert it to a float first, then to an integer.

Here is the function `transformation`:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

This function first converts the 'year' column to float, then to integer. This will work if all the values in the 'year' column are convertible to float. If there are any values that can't be converted to float, you'll get a `ValueError`.
