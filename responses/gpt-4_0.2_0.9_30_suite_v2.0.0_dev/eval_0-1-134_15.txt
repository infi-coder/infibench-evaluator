It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a web-developerâ€™s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow: it allows you to type CSS-like expressions that can be dynamically parsed, and produce output depending on what you type in the abbreviation.

For example, in an HTML file if you type `.classname` and then press `Tab`, it should expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, it might be because:

1. You're not working in an HTML file. Make sure the file you're working in is saved with a `.html` extension.
2. Your text editor doesn't support Emmet out of the box. If you're using a text editor like Sublime Text, Atom, or Visual Studio Code, Emmet should be included by default. If you're using a different text editor, you may need to install an Emmet plugin.
3. Emmet is not enabled. If you're using a text editor that supports Emmet, make sure it's enabled in your settings.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more details about your development environment (like which text editor you're using) and I'd be happy to help further!
