The error message you're seeing is related to the SSL/TLS version or encryption method used by your mail server. The error `ssl3_get_record:wrong version number` suggests that the client (your Laravel application) and the server (mail.propnex.sg) are not agreeing on the SSL/TLS version to use.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Change the MAIL_ENCRYPTION setting:** The `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` setting in your `.env` file is currently set to `ssl`. Try changing this to `tls`. If that doesn't work, you could try setting it to `null` to disable encryption (although this is not recommended for security reasons).

    ```
    MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
    ```

2. **Change the MAIL_PORT setting:** The `MAIL_PORT` setting in your `.env` file is currently set to `587`, which is typically used for TLS. If changing the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` setting to `tls` doesn't work, you could try changing the `MAIL_PORT` to `465`, which is typically used for SSL.

    ```
    MAIL_PORT=465
    ```

3. **Contact the mail server administrator:** If neither of the above solutions work, you may need to contact the administrator of the mail server (mail.propnex.sg) to find out which SSL/TLS versions and encryption methods are supported. They may be able to provide you with the correct settings to use in your Laravel application.

Remember to clear the configuration cache using `php artisan config:cache` after making changes to your `.env` file.
