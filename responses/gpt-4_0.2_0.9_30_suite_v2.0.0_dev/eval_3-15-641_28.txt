It sounds like you're trying to programmatically determine the local path of a file that's synced with SharePoint/OneDrive. Unfortunately, Excel VBA doesn't provide a built-in way to do this. However, you can try a workaround using the `Environ` function to get the local OneDrive folder and then append the relative path of your file.

Here's a simple example:

```vba
Sub GetLocalOneDrivePath()

    Dim oneDrivePath As String
    Dim relativePath As String
    Dim localPath As String

    ' Get the local OneDrive folder
    oneDrivePath = Environ("OneDrive")

    ' Define the relative path of your file
    ' You need to replace this with the actual relative path
    relativePath = "\Path\To\Your\File"

    ' Combine the OneDrive folder and the relative path
    localPath = oneDrivePath & relativePath

    ' Print the local path
    Debug.Print localPath

End Sub
```

This will give you the local path of the file if it's synced to the user's OneDrive folder. Note that this assumes that the user has the same relative path in their OneDrive.

If the users have different levels of folder sync, you might need a more complex solution, possibly involving the use of the Windows API to search for the folder. This could be slow and complex to implement, though.
