You can use the factory pattern to create different instances of `ServiceBusClient` and `ServiceBusSender` for different queues. Here's how you can do it:

1. Define an interface for your factory:

```csharp
public interface IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    ServiceBusSender CreateSender(string queueName);
    ServiceBusReceiver CreateReceiver(string queueName);
}
```

2. Implement the factory:

```csharp
public class ServiceBusClientFactory : IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    private readonly string _connectionString;
    private readonly ServiceBusClientOptions _clientOptions;

    public ServiceBusClientFactory(string connectionString, ServiceBusClientOptions clientOptions)
    {
        _connectionString = connectionString;
        _clientOptions = clientOptions;
    }

    public ServiceBusSender CreateSender(string queueName)
    {
        var client = new ServiceBusClient(_connectionString, _clientOptions);
        return client.CreateSender(queueName);
    }

    public ServiceBusReceiver CreateReceiver(string queueName)
    {
        var client = new ServiceBusClient(_connectionString, _clientOptions);
        return client.CreateReceiver(queueName);
    }
}
```

3. Register your factory in the DI container:

```csharp
_services.TryAddSingleton<IServiceBusClientFactory>(implementationFactory =>
{
    var serviceBusConfiguration = implementationFactory.GetRequiredService<Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptions<UserEventConsumerSetting>>().Value;

    return new ServiceBusClientFactory(serviceBusConfiguration.ServiceBusConnectionString, new ServiceBusClientOptions
    {
        TransportType = ServiceBusTransportType.AmqpWebSockets
    });
});
```

4. Use the factory to create `ServiceBusSender` and `ServiceBusReceiver` instances:

```csharp
public class CarReservationMessagingService
{
    private readonly ServiceBusSender _serviceBusSender;

    public CarReservationMessagingService(IServiceBusClientFactory serviceBusClientFactory)
    {
        _serviceBusSender = serviceBusClientFactory.CreateSender("yourQueueName");
    }

    // ...
}
```

This way, you can inject `IServiceBusClientFactory` wherever you need and create `ServiceBusSender` or `ServiceBusReceiver` for any queue.
