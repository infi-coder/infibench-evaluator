You need to call the `toast` method with the `show` argument on your toast element to make it appear. Here's how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event (like a button click), you can put this code inside an event handler.

Also, make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JS files in your HTML file. You need both for the toast component to work correctly.
