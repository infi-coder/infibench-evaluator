Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17, called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. You can install it using npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can adapt your code snippet like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Please note that this is an unofficial package, as the official `enzyme-adapter-react-17` has not been released yet. Therefore, use it at your own risk.
