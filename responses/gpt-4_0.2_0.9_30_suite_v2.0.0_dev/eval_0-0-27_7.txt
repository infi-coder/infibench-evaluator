The code you provided seems correct. However, there are a few things you can check to debug this issue:

1. **Network Connection**: Make sure your device/emulator has a stable internet connection. Sometimes, network issues can cause the request to hang indefinitely.

2. **Server Status**: Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can do this by simply pasting the URL into your web browser and seeing if it loads. If the server is down, you won't be able to fetch any data.

3. **Error Handling**: You might want to print out the error message to get more details about what's going wrong. You can modify your code like this:

    ```javascript
    if (error) {
        console.error(error);
        return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
    }
    ```

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (e.g., "@apollo/client": "^3.3.21") and see if the problem persists.

5. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using the React Native Debugger, make sure to enable 'Network Inspect'. This will allow you to see the network requests being made by your app and check if the request to the GraphQL server is being made correctly.

6. **CORS Policy**: If your server has a CORS policy, it might be rejecting the request from your app. You would need to configure the server to accept requests from your app's origin.

7. **GraphQL Query**: Make sure the GraphQL query is correct and the server supports it. You can test the query using a GraphQL client like GraphiQL or Apollo Studio.

If none of these steps help, please provide more details or any error messages you're seeing, and I'll be glad to assist further.
