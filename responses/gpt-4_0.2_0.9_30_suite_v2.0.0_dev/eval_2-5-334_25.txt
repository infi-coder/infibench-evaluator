You should use `@Configuration` when you want to define beans explicitly in code, typically via `@Bean` methods. This is often used when the bean cannot be automatically discovered by component scanning or when you want to create beans conditionally or with specific initialization parameters.

On the other hand, `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Component` are used for automatic discovery and wiring of beans via classpath scanning. They are typically used for defining beans that are part of your application's service layer, web layer, or general components respectively.
