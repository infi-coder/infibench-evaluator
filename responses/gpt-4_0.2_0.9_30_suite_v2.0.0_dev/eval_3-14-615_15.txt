In SwiftUI, there is no built-in way to get the current scroll position of a `ScrollView`. The `ScrollViewReader` and `ScrollViewProxy` only provide the `scrollTo` method, which is used to programmatically set the scroll position, not get it.

However, you can use `GeometryReader` to get the scroll offset. Here's a basic example:

```swift
ScrollView {
    GeometryReader { geometry in
        Color.clear.preference(key: ViewOffsetKey.self, value: geometry.frame(in: .named("scrollView")).minY)
    }.frame(height: 0)

    // Your ScrollView content here...
}
.onPreferenceChange(ViewOffsetKey.self) { offset in
    print("Current scroll offset: \(offset)")
}
.coordinateSpace(name: "scrollView")
```

In this example, `ViewOffsetKey` is a custom `PreferenceKey`. You would need to define it like this:

```swift
struct ViewOffsetKey: PreferenceKey {
    static var defaultValue: CGFloat = 0
    static func reduce(value: inout CGFloat, nextValue: () -> CGFloat) {
        value += nextValue()
    }
}
```

This will print the current scroll offset every time it changes. Note that this is a workaround and may not be perfect. It's a limitation of SwiftUI that it doesn't provide a built-in way to get the current scroll position.
