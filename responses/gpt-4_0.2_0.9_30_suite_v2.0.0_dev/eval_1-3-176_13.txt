The error message indicates that the zlib library, which is a required dependency for Pillow, could not be found. 

However, the issue you're facing might be due to the fact that you're trying to install an older version of Pillow (6.0.0) which does not support Python 3.8. 

You can try installing the latest version of Pillow which supports Python 3.8. 

To do this, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade Pillow
```

This command will upgrade Pillow to the latest version.

If you still face issues, you might need to install zlib library manually. The process to do this varies based on your operating system. You can find the instructions on the [official zlib website](http://www.zlib.net/).
