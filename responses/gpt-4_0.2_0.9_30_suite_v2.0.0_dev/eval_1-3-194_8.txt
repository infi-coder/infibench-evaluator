You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write data into an Excel file. Here is the function `writeToExcel` that you requested:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = Workbook()  # Create a new workbook
    ws = wb.active  # Get the active worksheet

    # Write data to worksheet
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
            ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

    # Save workbook to file
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new Excel workbook, writes the data from `new_list` into the active worksheet, and then saves the workbook to a file named "data.xlsx". The `ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])` line writes the value `new_list[i][j]` to the cell at row `i+1` and column `j+1` in the worksheet.

You can run the function using `writeExcel()`. After running, you should see a new file named "data.xlsx" in your current directory. The file will contain the data from `new_list`.
