Sure, here's how you can revise your code to upgrade from `connect-mongo` v3 to v4:

```javascript
const MongoStore = require('connect-mongo');

...

app.use(session({
    secret: 'story book',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: MongoStore.create({ mongoUrl: process.env.MONGODB_URI })
}))
```

Please note that in `connect-mongo` v4, the `MongoStore` is no longer a function but an object with a `create` method. The `mongooseConnection` option is replaced by `mongoUrl` which directly accepts the MongoDB connection string.
