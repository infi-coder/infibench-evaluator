You can disable the animation in ViewPager2 by creating a new `ViewPager2.PageTransformer` that overrides the `transformPage` method and does nothing. 

Here is how you can do it:

```java
viewPager2.setPageTransformer(new ViewPager2.PageTransformer() {
    @Override
    public void transformPage(@NonNull View page, float position) {
        // Do nothing.
    }
});
```

However, this will not disable the scrolling animation when you click on the tab. To disable that, you need to use a custom `LinearLayoutManager` that overrides the `smoothScrollToPosition` method:

```java
viewPager2.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(this) {
    @Override
    public void smoothScrollToPosition(RecyclerView recyclerView, RecyclerView.State state, int position) {
        // Do nothing.
    }
});
```

Please note that this will completely disable the scrolling animation, so the transition between tabs will be instant.
