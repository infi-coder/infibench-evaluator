The warning you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. This means that without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Open your Elasticsearch configuration file (`elasticsearch.yml`). This file is usually located in the `/etc/elasticsearch` or `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

    ```yaml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

This will enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features, including encrypted communication and role-based access control.

If you're using Elasticsearch for development purposes on your local machine and don't want to enable these security features, you can suppress the warning by adding the following line to your Elasticsearch configuration file:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: false
```

This will disable Elasticsearch's built-in security features and suppress the warning.

Remember to restart Elasticsearch after making these changes.

If you're using Homebrew to manage your Elasticsearch installation on your M1 Mac, the `elasticsearch.yml` file is typically located in the `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory. If you can't find the file, you can use the `find` command in your terminal to locate it:

```bash
find / -name "elasticsearch.yml"
```

This command will search your entire file system for a file named `elasticsearch.yml` and print its location.
