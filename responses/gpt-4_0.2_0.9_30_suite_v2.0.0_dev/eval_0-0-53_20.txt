The problem in your code is that you're trying to use inline JavaScript in a React component, which doesn't work as expected. In React, you should use the built-in event system. Here's how you can modify your code to display the alert when the upload button is clicked:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'

class Main extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      imageURL: '',
    };

    this.handleUploadImage = this.handleUploadImage.bind(this);
  }

  handleUploadImage(ev) {
    ev.preventDefault();

    const data = new FormData();
    data.append('file', this.uploadInput.files[0]);
    data.append('filename', this.fileName.value);

    fetch('http://localhost:8000/upload', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: data,
    }).then((response) => {
      response.json().then((body) => {
        this.setState({ imageURL: `http://localhost:8000/${body.file}` });
      });
    });

    alert("Your file is being uploaded!");
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleUploadImage}>
        <div>
          <input ref={(ref) => { this.uploadInput = ref; }} type="file" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <input ref={(ref) => { this.fileName = ref; }} type="text" placeholder="Enter the desired name of file" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          <button type="submit">Upload</button>
        </div>
        <img src={this.state.imageURL} alt="img" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}

export default Main;
```

In this code, I've moved the `alert` call into the `handleUploadImage` method, which is called when the form is submitted. This way, the alert will be displayed when the upload button is clicked. Also, I've changed the `onclick` attribute in the button to `type="submit"` to make sure the form is submitted when the button is clicked.
