The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are the requirements for Laravel 9:

- PHP >= 8.0
- BCMath PHP Extension
- Ctype PHP Extension
- Fileinfo PHP extension
- JSON PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension

You can check your PHP version by running:

```bash
php -v
```

If your PHP version is less than 8.0, you need to upgrade it.

You can check your installed PHP extensions by running:

```bash
php -m
```

If any of the required extensions are missing, you need to install them.

You've mentioned that you've updated Composer to version 2.3.10, which should be fine for Laravel 9.

After ensuring that your PHP version and extensions meet the requirements, try running the `composer create-project` command again. If you still encounter issues, it might be helpful to update Composer to the latest version:

```bash
composer self-update
```

Then try to create the Laravel project again:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.*"
```
