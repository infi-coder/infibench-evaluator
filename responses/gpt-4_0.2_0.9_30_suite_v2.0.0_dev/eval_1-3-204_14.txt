The `rename` function is used to rename the DataFrame columns or index. However, in your case, you are trying to rename the Series object returned by the `mean()` function, which doesn't have a `columns` attribute. 

You should convert the Series object to a DataFrame and then rename the column. Here is the corrected function:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg = avg.rename(columns={"p":"mean"})
    return avg
```

In this function, `groupby` is used to group the DataFrame by the "t" column. The `mean` function is then applied to the "p" column of each group. The `reset_index` function is used to convert the Series object to a DataFrame. Finally, the `rename` function is used to rename the "p" column to "mean".
