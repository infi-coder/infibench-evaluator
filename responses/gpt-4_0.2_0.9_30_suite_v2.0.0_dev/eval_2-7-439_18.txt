The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. You cannot install it via Composer. 

You need to install it via your PHP installation. 

If you are using a Unix-like operating system, you can install it via `pecl`:

```bash
pecl install zip
```

Or, if you are using Ubuntu, you can use `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you are using Windows, you can enable it in your `php.ini` file. Uncomment the line (remove the semicolon):

```ini
;extension=php_zip.dll
```

to

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing the extension, you may need to restart your web server for the changes to take effect.

Then, in your `composer.json` file, you can specify that your project requires the `ext-zip` extension like so:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1.3",
    "ext-zip": "*",
    // ...
},
```

This won't install the extension, but when someone tries to install your project via Composer, they will get a warning if they don't have the `ext-zip` extension installed.
