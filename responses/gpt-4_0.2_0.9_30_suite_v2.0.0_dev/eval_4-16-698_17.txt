You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how you do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, those changes will be applied to your current terminal session.

If you're using a different shell, like zsh, and you've made changes to `.zshrc`, you would use:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

This is equivalent to `.` command in bash:

```bash
. ~/.bash_profile
```

This is useful when you want to refresh your current shell session with the newly defined environment variables, functions, and aliases, etc., without having to close and reopen your terminal.
