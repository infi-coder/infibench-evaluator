The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. In Entity Framework, an index can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

In your case, `Gender` is a navigation property, so you cannot create an index on it. If you want to create an index on `GenderId`, you can do it like this:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, an index is created on the `GenderId` property, which is a scalar property, not a navigation property. This should resolve the error you're seeing.
