AWS CLI uses a pager program to handle its output. By default, it uses the `less` program. The pager is used to handle cases where the output of a command is too large to fit on the screen at once.

To disable the pager, you can set the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. You can do this on a per-command basis by prefixing your command with `AWS_PAGER=""`, like this:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  AWS_PAGER="" aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

Or, you can set it for your entire shell session by running this command before you start your loop:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

This will disable the pager for all subsequent AWS CLI commands in that shell session.

If you want to pipe the output to a file, you can do so using the `>` operator:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  AWS_PAGER="" aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > output.txt; 
done
```

This will write the output of each command to `output.txt`, overwriting the file each time. If you want to append to the file instead of overwriting it, you can use `>>` instead of `>`.
