The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that your system is trying to use the Windows version of npm, which is not compatible with the Linux subsystem. 

You can solve this issue by adding the following lines to your `.bashrc` file:

```bash
# Add the following lines to your .bashrc file
export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
```

This will ensure that your system uses the Linux version of npm and node, which are located in `/usr/bin`.

After adding these lines, you need to source your `.bashrc` file for the changes to take effect. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, when you run `npm -v`, it should display the correct version number. If it doesn't, you might need to reinstall npm using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

Then, check the version again:

```bash
npm -v
```

This should solve your problem.
