You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This pseudo-element is used by Bootstrap to create the arrow. Here is how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is expanded */
    color: green;
}

.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is collapsed */
    color: green;
}
```

This CSS will change the color of the arrow to green both when the accordion is expanded and when it is collapsed. If you want to have different colors for these two states, you can just change the color in the appropriate rule.
