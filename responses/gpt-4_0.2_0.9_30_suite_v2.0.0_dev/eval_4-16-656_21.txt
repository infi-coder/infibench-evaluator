The `Get-Service` cmdlet in PowerShell does not provide the detailed description of the service. However, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to get the description of the service.

Here is an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service" | Select-Object Name, Description | Out-GridView
```

This will display a grid view with the name and description of each service.

If you want to get the description of a specific service, you can filter it by the service name. Here is an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service Where Name = 'wuauserv'" | Select-Object Name, Description
```

This will display the name and description of the 'wuauserv' service.
