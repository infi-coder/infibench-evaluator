You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. Here's a simple function that you can use to set the clipboard text:

```vba
Sub CopyTextToClipboard(sText As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText sText
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
    Set DataObj = Nothing
End Sub
```

You can call this function with the text you want to copy to the clipboard:

```vba
Call CopyTextToClipboard(Me.NodeKey.Value)
```

Note: This requires a reference to the Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library. You can add this in the VBA editor under Tools -> References -> Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library.
