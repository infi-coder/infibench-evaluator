In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, it actually modifies the column names to make them unique. The column names of the resulting data frame are made unique by appending a suffix. 

In your case, the column names of `d3` would be `a` and `a.1`. So, you can select the second column by its name `a.1` as follows:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

If you want to keep the original names, you can use `data.table` package:

```r
library(data.table)
d1 <- data.table(a=c(1,2,3), key="a")
d2 <- data.table(a=c(3,4,5), key="a")
d3 <- cbind(d1,d2)

# Select the second column
second_col <- d3[,..2]
```

In this case, the column names remain the same as in the original data frames. The `..2` in the selection refers to the second occurrence of the column named `a`.
