You can create a dictionary from the first four elements of `b` and `rest`, then use a list comprehension to replace the elements in `last` based on this dictionary. Here is the function `ReplaceElementsByIndex`:

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    replace_dict = dict(zip(b[:4], rest))
    return [replace_dict.get(i, i) for i in last]
```

This function works by first creating a dictionary where the keys are the first four elements of `b` and the values are the elements of `rest`. Then it iterates over `last` and for each element, it tries to get the corresponding value from the dictionary. If the element is not in the dictionary (i.e., it is not one of the first four elements of `b`), it just keeps the original value.

Here is how you can use this function with your data:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

print(ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last))
```

This will output:

```python
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```
