The error message indicates that you are trying to create a PendingIntent without specifying either `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` or `FLAG_MUTABLE`. This is a requirement when targeting Android 12 (API level 31) and above.

The issue is that the `MediaSessionCompat` class is trying to create a PendingIntent without specifying these flags. This is a known issue and has been reported to Google's issue tracker.

As a workaround, you can create a PendingIntent yourself and pass it to the `MediaSessionCompat` constructor. Here's an example:

```kotlin
val mediaButtonReceiver = ComponentName(this, MediaButtonReceiver::class.java)
val mediaButtonIntent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_BUTTON)
mediaButtonIntent.component = mediaButtonReceiver

val pendingIntentFlags = if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.S) {
    PendingIntent.FLAG_MUTABLE
} else {
    0
}

val mbrIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(
    this,
    0,
    mediaButtonIntent,
    pendingIntentFlags
)

mediaSession = MediaSessionCompat(
    this,
    TAG,
    mediaButtonReceiver,
    mbrIntent
).apply {
    setCallback(mediaSessionCallback)
    isActive = true
}
```

In this code, we are creating a PendingIntent with the `FLAG_MUTABLE` flag if the Android version is S or above. We then pass this PendingIntent to the `MediaSessionCompat` constructor.

Please note that this is a workaround and the issue should be fixed in a future version of the AndroidX Media library.
