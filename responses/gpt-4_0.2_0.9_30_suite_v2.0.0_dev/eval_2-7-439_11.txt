The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling zip archives. It's not a Composer package, so you can't install it using `composer require`.

If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can install it via the terminal with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you're using Windows, you need to enable it in your `php.ini` file. You can do this by removing the semicolon before the line `extension=php_zip.dll`.

After installing or enabling the extension, you should restart your web server to make sure the changes take effect.

Then, you can check if the extension is enabled by running `php -m` in your terminal. If it's enabled, you should see `zip` in the list of modules.

If you still encounter the same problem in PHPStorm, you can try invalidating caches and restarting PHPStorm:

1. Go to `File` > `Invalidate Caches / Restart...`
2. Click on `Invalidate and Restart`

This should solve your problem.
