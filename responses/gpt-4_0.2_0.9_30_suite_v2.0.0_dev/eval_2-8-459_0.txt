The error message you're seeing indicates that Go is unable to find the specified version of the module. This could be due to a number of reasons, including network issues, incorrect configuration, or the specified version not existing.

Here are a few steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. **Check your network connection**: Make sure that your internet connection is stable and you're able to access the internet.

2. **Check your Go version**: Ensure that you're using the same Go version on both computers. You can check your Go version by running `go version` in your terminal.

3. **Check your Go environment variables**: Run `go env` to check your Go environment variables. Ensure that `GOPROXY` is set correctly. If you're behind a corporate proxy, you might need to set this variable to `direct`.

4. **Check your Git configuration**: Since the module that's failing is a private repository, ensure that your Git configuration is correct. You might need to set your `git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://` if you're behind a firewall.

5. **Check the module version**: Ensure that the specified version of the module actually exists. You can check this by visiting the module's repository and checking the list of tags.

6. **Try to manually clone the repository**: Try to manually clone the repository using `git clone`. This can help you determine if the issue is with Go or with your Git configuration.

7. **Check your GitHub credentials**: Ensure that your GitHub credentials are correct and that you have access to the repository. You can check this by trying to clone the repository manually.

8. **Clear your Go module cache**: You can clear your Go module cache by running `go clean -modcache`. This will force Go to redownload all your dependencies.

If none of these steps help, you might want to consider asking for help on the Go community forums or on Stack Overflow.
