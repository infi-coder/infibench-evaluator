You can conform to `ShapeStyle` by creating a struct that implements the `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType)` method. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        shape.fill = Color.red._apply(to:)
    }
}
```

Please note that `_ShapeStyle_ShapeType` and `_apply(to:)` are underscored because they are private APIs, which means Apple does not guarantee their availability in future versions of SwiftUI. Therefore, it's not recommended to use them in production code. 

In your case, it's better to use `Color.red` directly or create a custom `View` that draws the shape with the desired style.
