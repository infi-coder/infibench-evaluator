Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a function that removes timezone information from all datetime columns in a DataFrame:

```python
def removeTimezone(df):
    for col in df.columns:
        if df[col].dtype == 'datetime64[ns, UTC]':
            df[col] = df[col].dt.tz_convert(None)
    return df
```

This function iterates over all columns in the DataFrame. If the column type is 'datetime64[ns, UTC]', it converts the timezone to None, effectively removing the timezone information.

Please note that this function will modify the original DataFrame. If you want to keep the original DataFrame unchanged, you should create a copy before calling this function.

Here is how you can use this function:

```python
df = removeTimezone(df)
```

After this, you should be able to save your DataFrame to Excel without any issues.
