The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It is part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

This attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using an older version of EF Core, you won't have access to this attribute.

To use the `[Keyless]` attribute, you need to:

1. Make sure you are using EF Core 5.0 or later.
2. Add a reference to the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace in your code.

Here is an example of how to use it:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    // Other properties...
}
```

And in your `DbContext`:

```csharp
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

Then you can use it as you mentioned:

```csharp
_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)
```

Remember, the `[Keyless]` attribute is used to specify that the entity type does not have any key and will never have a key. It is typically used for entities that map to views or queries and may not have a primary key.
