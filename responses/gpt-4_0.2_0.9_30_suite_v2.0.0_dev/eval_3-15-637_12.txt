The error you're experiencing might be due to a few reasons. Here are some suggestions to troubleshoot:

1. **Check SeleniumBasic version**: Ensure that you have the latest version of SeleniumBasic installed. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/florentbr/SeleniumBasic/releases).

2. **Check Browser Drivers**: Make sure that the browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome, IEDriver for Internet Explorer) are up-to-date and compatible with the version of the browser you're using. You can download the latest browser drivers from the Selenium [website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/).

3. **Check References**: In VBA, go to `Tools > References` and ensure that `Selenium Type Library` is checked.

4. **Check Internet Explorer Settings**: Since you're using Internet Explorer as your browser, ensure that the `Enable Protected Mode` setting is the same for all zones in the Internet Options. To do this, go to `Internet Options > Security tab` and check the status of `Enable Protected Mode` for Internet, Local intranet, Trusted sites, and Restricted sites.

5. **Code Modification**: Try to modify your code as follows:

```vba
Dim driver As WebDriver
Set driver = New WebDriver

driver.Start "ie", "https://www.google.com"
driver.Window.Maximize
```
