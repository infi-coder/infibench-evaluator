You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write to an Excel file. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install openpyxl
```

Here is the function `writeToExcel`:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeToExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

    # Create a workbook and select the active worksheet
    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active

    # Write the data to the worksheet
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
            ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

    # Save the workbook
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new Excel workbook, writes the data from `new_list` into the active worksheet, and then saves the workbook as "data.xlsx". The `ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])` line is used to write each individual value from `new_list` into the appropriate cell in the worksheet.
