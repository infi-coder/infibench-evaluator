Your VBA code is almost correct, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed. 

First, you are trying to assign a value to `query` and `currentSheet` without declaring them as variables. 

Second, you are trying to use `query.Name` but `query` is a string, not an object, so it doesn't have a `Name` property.

Here's the corrected code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As String
    
    ' Assign the query string and the current sheet name
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value
    currentSheet = ActiveSheet.Name
    
    ' Create a new ListObject with a QueryTable
    With ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With
     
End Sub
```

This code will create a new QueryTable in the "target" sheet, using the query string from cell A1 of "Sheet6". The QueryTable will automatically refresh when you run the macro.
