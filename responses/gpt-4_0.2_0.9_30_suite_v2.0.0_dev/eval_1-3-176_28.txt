The error message you're seeing is indicating that the zlib library, which is a required dependency for Pillow, is not found on your system. 

However, the problem you're facing is likely due to the fact that you're trying to install an old version of Pillow (6.0.0) which does not support Python 3.8. 

You should try to install the latest version of Pillow, which supports Python 3.8. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pillow
```

If you're still having issues, you might want to consider using a Python version that is compatible with the Pillow version you're trying to install. You can manage different Python versions with tools like `pyenv`.

Also, make sure that you have the latest version of pip. You can upgrade pip using the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

If you're still having issues after trying these steps, please let me know!
