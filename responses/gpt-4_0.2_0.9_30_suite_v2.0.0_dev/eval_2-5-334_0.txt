You should use `@Configuration` when you want to define beans explicitly in your application. This annotation is used with `@Bean` annotation to declare Spring Beans. It's typically used when you want to create beans from third-party libraries or to have more control over the bean initialization process.

On the other hand, `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Component` are used for automatic detection and configuration of beans using classpath scanning. They are typically used when you want Spring to automatically manage your beans. 

- `@Service`: Used in service layer classes.
- `@Controller`: Used in Spring MVC controller classes.
- `@Component`: General annotation, can be used across application.

So, the choice between `@Configuration` and `@Service/@Controller/@Component` depends on your specific needs and the level of control you want over the bean creation process.
