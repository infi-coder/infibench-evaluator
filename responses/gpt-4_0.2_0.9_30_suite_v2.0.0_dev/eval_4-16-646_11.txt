The error message `bad CPU type in executable` typically means that the binary you are trying to run is not compatible with the architecture of your CPU. This is a common issue on MacOS Catalina because it dropped support for 32-bit applications.

`pdftk` is one of the applications that is not yet compatible with MacOS Catalina. However, there is a workaround to this issue by using `pdftk-java`, a reimplementation of `pdftk` in Java, which should work on any system that has Java installed.

Here are the steps to install `pdftk-java` on MacOS:

1. First, you need to install Homebrew if you haven't already. Open Terminal and paste the following command:

    ```markdown
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install `pdftk-java` by running:

    ```markdown
    brew install pdftk-java
    ```

3. After the installation, you can use `pdftk-java` in the same way as `pdftk`. However, the command to run it is `pdftk-java` instead of `pdftk`.

    For example, to merge two PDF files, you would run:

    ```markdown
    pdftk-java file1.pdf file2.pdf cat output merged.pdf
    ```

Please note that `pdftk-java` requires Java to run. If you don't have Java installed on your system, you can install it using Homebrew:

```markdown
brew cask install java
```

If you still want to use the original `pdftk`, you would need to downgrade your MacOS to a version that supports 32-bit applications, or find a different tool that is compatible with MacOS Catalina.
