Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. `query` and `currentSheet` are not declared. You should declare them as `String` and `Worksheet` respectively.
2. `query` is assigned a value from a cell, but then you use `query.Name` which is incorrect because `query` is a string, not an object.
3. `currentSheet` is assigned but not used in the code.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Assign the query string from a cell
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Assign the active sheet to currentSheet
    currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Add a QueryTable to the "target" sheet
    With Sheets("target").ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With
     
End Sub
```

Please note that this code assumes that the query string in `Sheet6` cell `A1` is a valid Power Query query, and that the `target` sheet exists.
