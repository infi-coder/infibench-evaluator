Sure, here is a simple bash script that will install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink current python
brew unlink python

# Install specific version of python
brew install python@3.6

# Link the python version
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will unlink your current version of Python and link to Python 3.6.5. If you have other Python versions installed and linked, you might need to adjust the script accordingly.
