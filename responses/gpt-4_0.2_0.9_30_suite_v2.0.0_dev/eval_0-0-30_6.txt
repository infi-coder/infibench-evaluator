Enzyme does not officially support React 17 yet. However, there is an unofficial adapter available for React 17 called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. You can use it until the official adapter is released.

First, install the adapter:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can adapt your code snippet like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

This should allow you to use Enzyme with React 17.
