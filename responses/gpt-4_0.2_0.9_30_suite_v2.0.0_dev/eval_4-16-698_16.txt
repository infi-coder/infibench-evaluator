You can use the `source` command to load any changes made to your `.bash_profile` without having to close and reopen your terminal. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command reads and executes commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, those changes are recognized because the file is read and executed in your current shell context.

Alternatively, you can use the `.` command, which is an alias for `source`:

```bash
. ~/.bash_profile
```

Both of these commands will work in MacOS and Linux.
