You can use `awk` to extract the language code. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | head -1 | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'
```

This command does the following:

1. `curl -Ls stick-it.app`: Fetches the HTML content of the page.
2. `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'`: Searches for the `lang` attribute and its value. The `-o` option tells `grep` to only output the matched string.
3. `head -1`: Takes only the first match.
4. `awk -F'"' '{print $2}'`: Splits the string by the `"` character and prints the second field, which is the language code.

This command should work regardless of the position of the `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag.
