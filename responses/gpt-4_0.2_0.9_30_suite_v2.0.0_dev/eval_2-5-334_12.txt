You should use `@Configuration` when you want to define beans explicitly in your application. This annotation is used with `@Bean` annotation to declare Spring Beans. It's typically used when the bean cannot be picked up automatically by component scanning (e.g., third-party library classes or configuring multiple beans of the same type) or when you want to create beans conditionally or programmatically.

On the other hand, `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Component` are stereotypes annotations used for auto-detection of components. They are used to annotate classes at the stereotype level, allowing for automatic Spring bean detection within the classpath.

- `@Service`: used with service classes.
- `@Controller`: used with Spring MVC controller classes.
- `@Component`: a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.

So, the choice between `@Configuration` and `@Service/@Controller/@Component` depends on whether you want explicit control over bean creation or you want Spring to automatically manage it.
