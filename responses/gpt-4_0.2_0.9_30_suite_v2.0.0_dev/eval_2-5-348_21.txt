This issue is related to the way Java handles quotes in commands. It seems like the command is not correctly formed due to the embedded quotes. 

You can try to escape the quotes using the backslash (`\`) character. Here's how you can modify your command:

```bash
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "\"\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd\" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path=\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar\" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install\""
```

If the problem persists, you might want to check your environment variables. Make sure that the `JAVA_HOME` variable is correctly set to your JDK installation directory.

If you're still having trouble, it might be a bug with NetBeans 11.1. You could consider updating to a newer version of NetBeans or reporting the issue to the NetBeans team.
