You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` object to interact with the clipboard. Here's how you can do it:

First, you need to add a reference to "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library". To do this:

1. Open the VBA editor by pressing `Alt + F11`.
2. Go to `Tools > References`.
3. Scroll down and check "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library".
4. Click `OK`.

Then, you can use the following code to copy text to the clipboard:

```vba
Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject

DataObj.SetText Me.NodeKey.Value
DataObj.PutInClipboard
```

This will copy the value of `Me.NodeKey.Value` to the clipboard.
