Assuming the line you want to split is a string with values separated by a specific delimiter (like a comma or a space), you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the string into an array, and then assign the array elements to the different columns. Here's how you can do it:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim arr() As String
    arr = Split(textline, " ") 'replace " " with your delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = arr(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = arr(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = arr(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = arr(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = arr(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code splits the `textline` into an array `arr` using space as a delimiter, and then assigns the elements of the array to the cells in columns G, H, I, J, and K. You should replace `" "` with the actual delimiter in your text file. If the number of elements can vary, you should add error handling to avoid out-of-bounds errors.
