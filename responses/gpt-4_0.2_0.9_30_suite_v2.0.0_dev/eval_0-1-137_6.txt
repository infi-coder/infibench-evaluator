The error you're getting is because you're trying to override the `$theme-colors` map after it's already been defined in the Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` file. You should define your custom colors before importing Bootstrap's SCSS files.

Here's how you can do it:

```scss
// Define your custom colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here
);

// Import Bootstrap's SCSS
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Replace `#your-color-here` with the color you want to use for the primary color.

Also, make sure you're using a valid color value. It can be a named color (like `red`), a hexadecimal color (like `#ff0000`), an RGB color (like `rgb(255, 0, 0)`), or an HSL color (like `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)`).

If you want to override more colors, you can do so by adding more entries to the `$theme-colors` map. For example:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-primary-color,
  "secondary": #your-secondary-color,
  // Add more colors as needed
);
```

Replace `#your-primary-color`, `#your-secondary-color`, etc., with the colors you want to use.
