In Font Awesome 5, the way to use icons in CSS has changed slightly. You need to specify the style of the icon in the `font-family` property (either `Font Awesome 5 Free`, `Font Awesome 5 Brands`, or `Font Awesome 5 Pro`), and you also need to specify the `font-weight`.

Here's how you can modify your CSS to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* or "Font Awesome 5 Brands" or "Font Awesome 5 Pro" */
  font-weight: 900; /* "Font Awesome 5 Free" uses weights 900 for solid, 400 for regular, and 300 for light. */
}
```

Please replace the `font-family` and `font-weight` values according to the style of the icon you want to use. If you're using the Pro version, you'll have access to additional weights.
