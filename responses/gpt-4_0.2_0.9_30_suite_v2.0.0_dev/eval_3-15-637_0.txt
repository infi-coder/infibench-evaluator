The error you're experiencing might be due to a number of reasons. Here are some suggestions to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Check SeleniumBasic and Browser Driver Version:** Ensure that you have the latest version of SeleniumBasic installed. Also, make sure that the browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome) is compatible with the browser version you're using.

2. **Check References:** In VBA, go to `Tools > References` and make sure that Selenium Type Library is checked. If it's not, scroll down the list, find it and check it.

3. **Check Internet Explorer:** You're using Internet Explorer in your code (`driver.Start "ie"`). Make sure that Internet Explorer is installed and updated on your machine. If you're not specifically required to use IE, you might want to try using a different browser like Chrome or Firefox.

4. **Check Excel Trust Center Settings:** In Excel, go to `File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Macro Settings` and make sure that `Trust access to the VBA project object model` is checked.

5. **Reinstall SeleniumBasic:** Uninstall SeleniumBasic, restart your machine, and then reinstall SeleniumBasic.

6. **Code Adjustment:** Try to declare and instantiate your WebDriver object like this:

```vba
Dim driver As WebDriver
Set driver = New WebDriver
```
