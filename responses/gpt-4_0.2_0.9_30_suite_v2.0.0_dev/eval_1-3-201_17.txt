You can use Python's `multiprocessing` module to run these two tasks concurrently. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
import multiprocessing
from dash import Dash
import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc
import db
import hp
import fd

def run_dash():
    app = Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
    database=db.dataBase()
    homepage=hp.homepage(database)
    homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
    homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()
    app.run_server(debug=True)

def run_data_mining():
    database=db.dataBase()
    dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create processes
    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=run_dash)
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=run_data_mining)

    # Start processes
    p1.start()
    p2.start()

    # Join processes
    p1.join()
    p2.join()
```

In this code, `run_dash` and `run_data_mining` are two separate functions that are run in different processes. The `multiprocessing.Process` class is used to create a new process for each function. The `start` method is used to start each process, and the `join` method is used to make the main process wait until both processes have completed.

Please note that `multiprocessing` creates separate processes and not threads. Each Python process has its own Python interpreter and memory space, so the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is not a problem. This means that your two functions can run truly concurrently, taking full advantage of multiple processors if they are available.

However, keep in mind that sharing data between processes is more complicated than sharing data between threads. If your `run_dash` and `run_data_mining` functions need to share data, you may need to use one of the data sharing techniques provided by the `multiprocessing` module, such as pipes, queues, or shared memory.
