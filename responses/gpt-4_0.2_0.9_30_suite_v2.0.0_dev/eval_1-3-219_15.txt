This issue might be due to a variety of reasons. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve it:

1. **Check your Python interpreter**: Make sure that you have selected the correct Python interpreter in VS Code. You can do this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of the status bar, or by using the `Python: Select Interpreter` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

2. **Check your Jupyter server**: Try to start your Jupyter server manually from the command line using the `jupyter notebook` command. If there are any issues with your Jupyter installation, they should appear here.

3. **Reinstall Jupyter and ipykernel**: Sometimes, reinstalling Jupyter and ipykernel can solve the issue. You can do this with the following commands:

```bash
conda activate da38
pip uninstall ipykernel jupyter
pip install ipykernel jupyter
```

4. **Check your VS Code settings**: Make sure that the `python.dataScience.jupyterServerURI` setting in your VS Code settings is set to `"local"`.

5. **Update your packages**: Make sure that all your packages are up to date. You can update all your packages in the current conda environment with the following command:

```bash
conda update --all
```

6. **Check your firewall settings**: If you are using a firewall, make sure that it is not blocking the connection to the Jupyter server.

7. **Check your VS Code version**: Make sure that you are using the latest version of VS Code. If not, try updating it.

If none of these steps work, please provide more details about your setup (e.g., Python version, Jupyter version, VS Code version, etc.) and any error messages you are seeing.
