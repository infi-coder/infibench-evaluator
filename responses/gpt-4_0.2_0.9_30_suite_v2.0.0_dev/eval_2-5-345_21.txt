The error you're encountering is due to a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version that comes with Spring Boot 2.7.0. 

The Maven version that comes with Spring Boot 2.7.0 is 3.8.5, and it seems that IntelliJ IDEA has some issues with this version. 

Here are a few possible solutions:

1. **Downgrade Maven version**: You can manually downgrade the Maven version in your project to a version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by modifying the `pom.xml` file in your project.

2. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: JetBrains, the company behind IntelliJ IDEA, regularly releases updates to their IDEs. It's possible that they have already released a fix for this issue. You can check for updates by going to `Help > Check for Updates...` in IntelliJ IDEA.

3. **Use an External Maven**: Instead of using the bundled Maven, you can configure IntelliJ IDEA to use an external Maven installation. You can download a compatible Maven version from the [official Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). After downloading and installing Maven, you can configure IntelliJ IDEA to use it by going to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven`.

Remember to restart IntelliJ IDEA after making these changes to ensure that they take effect.
