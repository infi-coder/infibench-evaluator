The issue you're facing is due to the asynchronous nature of the `onItemSelectedListener`. The `onItemSelected` function is not immediately called when you set the listener. It is called later when an item is actually selected in the spinner. 

That's why the log inside `onItemSelected` (log 1) is printed after the log at the end of `setupListWithAdapter` (log 2). When `setupListWithAdapter` returns `itemSelected`, `onItemSelected` might not have been called yet, so `itemSelected` is still its initial value (an empty string).

To fix this, you could use a higher-order function or a callback that is called when an item is selected. Here is an example:

```kotlin
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>, callback: (String) -> Unit) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            Log.e("categoryLog","1 : " + itemSelected)
            callback(itemSelected)
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
}
```

Then, when you call `setupListWithAdapter`, you provide a function that will be called with the selected item:

```kotlin
mySpinner.setupListWithAdapter(myList) { selectedItem ->
    // Do something with selectedItem
    Log.e("categoryLog","2 : " + selectedItem)
}
```

This way, you ensure that your code that depends on the selected item is executed after an item is actually selected.
