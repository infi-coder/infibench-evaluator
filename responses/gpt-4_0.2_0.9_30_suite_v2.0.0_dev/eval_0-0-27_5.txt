The code you've provided seems correct and should work as expected. However, there could be a few reasons why you're experiencing this issue:

1. **Network issues**: Make sure your device/emulator is connected to the internet and can access the provided URL.

2. **Server issues**: The server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' might be down or not responding. You can check this by trying to access the URL in a web browser.

3. **CORS issues**: If your server doesn't allow requests from your client's origin, it might be blocking the request. This is usually not an issue with React Native, but it's worth checking.

4. **Apollo Client version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (e.g., "@apollo/client": "3.3.21") and see if the problem persists.

5. **GraphQL query**: Make sure the GraphQL query is correct and the server supports it. You can test the query using a GraphQL client like Apollo Studio or GraphQL Playground.

If none of these solutions work, I would recommend trying to debug the network request. You can use a tool like [Reactotron](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron) or [Flipper](https://fbflipper.com/) to inspect the network requests and see what's going wrong.
