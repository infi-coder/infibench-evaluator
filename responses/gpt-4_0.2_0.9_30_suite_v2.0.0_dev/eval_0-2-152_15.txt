You need to call the `.toast('show')` method on the toast element to make it visible. Here's how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This code selects the toast element using its class name and then calls the `toast('show')` method to display it.

Also, make sure you have included the Bootstrap CSS and JS files in your HTML file. If you haven't, the toast functionality won't work. Here's how you can include them:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- JS, Popper.js, and jQuery -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Please replace the version numbers with the ones you are using.
