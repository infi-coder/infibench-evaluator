If the data in the line following "Cabinet No." is separated by a specific character (like a comma or a space), you can use the `Split` function to divide the string into an array and then assign each array element to a separate column. 

Here's how you can modify your code:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, ",") ' replace "," with your delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code assumes that the line of text is split into exactly five parts. If the number of parts can vary, you should add error checking to prevent out-of-bounds errors.
