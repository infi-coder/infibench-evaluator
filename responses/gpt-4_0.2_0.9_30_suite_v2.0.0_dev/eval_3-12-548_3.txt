Use `WillPopScope` instead of `Navigator.pop(context)` or `Navigator.of(context).pop()`. 

`WillPopScope` is a widget that detects when the user has pressed the back button on their device. It has a property called `onWillPop` that you can override to control what happens when the user presses the back button. 

Here is an example of how you can use it:

```dart
return WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () async => false, // this will disable the back button
  child: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('Login Page'),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: Text('Welcome to the Login Page'),
    ),
  ),
);
```

In this example, the `onWillPop` function is set to an asynchronous function that always returns false. This effectively disables the back button.
