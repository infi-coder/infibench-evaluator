To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement the `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType)` method. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        shape.fill = Color.red._apply(to:)
    }
}
```

However, `_ShapeStyle_ShapeType` and `_apply(to:)` are private APIs and not intended for public use. 

A better way to conform to `ShapeStyle` is to use a `View` that returns a `Color`:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    var body: some View {
        Color.red
    }
}
```

But this will still not work because `ShapeStyle` is not a protocol that your custom types are supposed to conform to. It's more of a way for SwiftUI to group several types together. 

In your case, you should use `Color.red` directly or create a custom color.
