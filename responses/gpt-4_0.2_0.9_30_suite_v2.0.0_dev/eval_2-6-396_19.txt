The error is occurring because you are trying to create an index on a navigation property `Gender` which is not allowed. Indexes can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

If you want to create an index on `GenderId` which is a foreign key, you can do it like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, the index is created on `GenderId` which is a foreign key in `User` entity pointing to `Gender` entity. This will speed up the queries that filter or sort the data based on `GenderId`.
