Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17 called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. You can install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

or

```bash
yarn add @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can use it in your code like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Please note that this is an unofficial package, and it might not support all features or have the same level of support as the official adapters. However, it is currently the best option available for testing React 17 applications with Enzyme.
