The problem with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, not if each character of the input string is in the `correct` string. 

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)
```

This function uses the `all` function and a generator expression to check if all characters in the input string are in the `correct` string. If they are, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
