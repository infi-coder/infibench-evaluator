The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. In Entity Framework, indexes can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

Here's how you can fix it:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId); // Change this line
    });
}
```

In the above code, I've changed the `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` line to `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);`. Now, the index is being created on the `GenderId` property, which is a scalar property, not a navigation property. This should fix the error you're seeing.
