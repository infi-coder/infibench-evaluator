Sure, you can use the `calendar` module in Python to check if a year is a leap year or not. Here is a function that does this:

```python
import calendar

def DaysInYear(year):
    if calendar.isleap(year):
        return 366
    else:
        return 365
```

This function takes a year as an argument and returns the number of days in that year. The `calendar.isleap(year)` function returns `True` if the year is a leap year, and `False` otherwise.

If you want to extract the year from a datetime in pandas and then calculate the number of days in that year, you can do it like this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import calendar

def DaysInYear(date):
    year = pd.to_datetime(date).year
    if calendar.isleap(year):
        return 366
    else:
        return 365
```

In this version of the function, `date` should be a string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The function first converts the string to a datetime object with `pd.to_datetime(date)`, then extracts the year with `.year`. The rest of the function is the same as before.
