Yes, you can draw vertical lines (vertical divider) between components in Flutter. Flutter provides a widget called `VerticalDivider` for this purpose.

Here is a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 2'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 3'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, `VerticalDivider` is used to draw vertical lines between three text widgets. You can customize the color, thickness, and width of the divider as per your needs.

Please note that `VerticalDivider` is a widget that displays a one device pixel thick vertical line, with padding on either side. In the material design language, this represents a divider. Dividers can be used in lists, `Drawer`s, and elsewhere to separate content.
