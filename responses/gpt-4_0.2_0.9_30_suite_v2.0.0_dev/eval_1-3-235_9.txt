The error you're getting is because the 'year' column contains float values represented as strings (e.g., '2021.0'). The `int()` function can't directly convert such strings to integers. 

You need to first convert these strings to floats, then convert the floats to integers. Here's how you can do this:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

This function first converts the 'year' column to float, then to int. This will remove the decimal part of the 'year' values.
