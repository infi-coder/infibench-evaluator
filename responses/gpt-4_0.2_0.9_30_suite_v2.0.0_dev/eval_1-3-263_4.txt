The `f` before the string in the `print` function is used to create what's known as an f-string (formatted string literal) in Python. It was introduced in Python 3.6.

An f-string is a string that is prefixed with the letter 'f'. They are used to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`. The expressions will be replaced with their values when the string is printed.

In your code:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

`{args.input_directory}` and `{args.output_directory}` are expressions embedded in the f-strings. When these lines are executed, these expressions will be replaced by the values of `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` respectively.

So, if `args.input_directory` is `/home/user/input` and `args.output_directory` is `/home/user/output`, the printed output will be:

```
Input directory: /home/user/input
Output directory: /home/user/output
```
