You should use `@Configuration` when you want to define beans explicitly in your application. It is typically used in situations where you need to create Spring Beans using third-party classes that you can't annotate directly. 

On the other hand, `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Component` are used to auto-detect and auto-configure beans using classpath scanning. They are typically used for defining beans for your own classes that are part of your application. 

In summary, use `@Configuration` for explicit, programmatic bean definition and use `@Service`, `@Controller`, or `@Component` for auto-detection and auto-configuration of beans.
