The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. In Entity Framework, navigation properties are used to establish relationships between entities (like the relationship between `User` and `Gender` in your case). They do not map directly to a specific column in the database, so you cannot create an index on them.

If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity, you should do it like this:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);` creates an index on the `GenderId` column in the `User` table. This can improve performance when querying based on the `GenderId` field.
