This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being associated with the correct target. Here are some steps to fix it:

1. Open your SwiftUI file.
2. Click on the file name in the top center of Xcode.
3. In the file inspector on the right, under "Target Membership", make sure your app's target is checked.

If the problem persists, try these additional steps:

1. Clean the build folder (Product -> Clean Build Folder).
2. Delete derived data. You can find the location of derived data in Xcode -> Preferences -> Locations.
3. Restart Xcode.

If none of these work, it might be a bug in Xcode 12.3. You could try updating to a newer version of Xcode if available, or downgrading to a stable version where you didn't experience this issue.
