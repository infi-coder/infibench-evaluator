The error message you're getting is because you're trying to create an index on a navigation property, which is not allowed in Entity Framework. 

Indexes in Entity Framework are used to speed up the performance of data retrieval operations on a database. They are typically created on columns that are frequently searched or that are used in JOIN, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, or top-N queries.

Navigation properties in Entity Framework represent the other side of a relationship between two entities. In your case, `Gender` is a navigation property on `User` entity, representing the relationship between a user and their gender.

You should create an index on the `GenderId` property instead, which is the foreign key property. Here's how you can do it:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

Now, when you run the migration command, it should work without any errors.
