You can use Python's multiprocessing module to run these two tasks concurrently. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
import multiprocessing
from dash import Dash
import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc
import db
import hp
import fd

def run_dash():
    app = Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
    database=db.dataBase()
    homepage=hp.homepage(database)
    homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
    homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()
    app.run_server(debug=True)

def run_data_mining():
    database=db.dataBase()
    dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create processes
    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=run_dash)
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=run_data_mining)

    # Start processes
    p1.start()
    p2.start()

    # Join processes
    p1.join()
    p2.join()
```

In this code, we define two functions `run_dash` and `run_data_mining` that encapsulate the tasks you want to run concurrently. We then create two processes `p1` and `p2` that run these functions. The `start` method starts the processes, and the `join` method waits for them to complete.

Please note that the `multiprocessing` module spawns new processes, which means that each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space. Therefore, the two processes cannot directly share objects. If your `database` object needs to be shared between the two processes, you might need to use a different approach, such as using a server-based database that both processes can connect to independently.
