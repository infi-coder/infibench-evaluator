Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. You're trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you haven't declared them. In VBA, you need to declare your variables before using them.

2. You're trying to use `query` as a `WorkbookQuery` object, but you're assigning it a string value. You need to create a `WorkbookQuery` object and assign it to `query`.

3. You're trying to use `currentSheet` as a `Worksheet` object, but you're assigning it a string value. You need to assign a `Worksheet` object to `currentSheet`.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As WorkbookQuery
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    Set query = ThisWorkbook.Queries.Add("MyQuery", Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value)
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query.Name _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query.Name & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

    ' Delete the query after it's been used
    ThisWorkbook.Queries.Item(query.Name).Delete

End Sub
```

This code creates a new `WorkbookQuery` object using the query text from cell A1 on Sheet6, then uses that query to populate a `ListObject` on the active sheet. After the query has been used, it's deleted from the workbook's collection of queries.
