The `f` before the string in the `print` function is used to denote a formatted string literal, also known as an f-string. This is a feature introduced in Python 3.6.

F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting. The expressions are enclosed in curly braces `{}` and are replaced with their values when the string is printed.

In your example:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

`{args.input_directory}` and `{args.output_directory}` are expressions within the f-string. When the string is printed, these expressions are replaced with the values of `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` respectively.

So, if `args.input_directory` is `/home/user/input` and `args.output_directory` is `/home/user/output`, the printed output would be:

```
Input directory: /home/user/input
Output directory: /home/user/output
```
