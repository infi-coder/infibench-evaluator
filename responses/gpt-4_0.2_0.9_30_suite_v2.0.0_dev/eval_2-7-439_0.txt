The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. That's why you can't install it with `composer require ext-zip`.

If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can install the `zip` extension with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you're using Windows, you will need to enable the extension in your `php.ini` file. You can do this by removing the semicolon before the line `extension=php_zip.dll`.

After installing or enabling the `zip` extension, you should add it to your `composer.json` file to indicate that your project depends on it. You can do this by adding the following lines to your `composer.json`:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1.3",
    "ext-zip": "*"
}
```

Then run `composer update` to update your project dependencies.

Remember to replace `"php": "^7.1.3"` with your actual PHP version.

If you still encounter issues, it might be because your command line is using a different PHP version than PHPStorm. You can check the PHP version used by your command line with `php -v` and compare it with the PHP version used by PHPStorm (File > Settings > Languages & Frameworks > PHP).
