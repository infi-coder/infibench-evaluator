Yes, you are correct. Since Spring 4.3, if a class has only one constructor, the `@Autowired` annotation is no longer necessary. Spring will use that constructor automatically for dependency injection.

However, if there are multiple constructors, Spring won't know which one to use, so you'll need to annotate the constructor you want with `@Autowired`.

People might still use `@Autowired` on constructors out of habit, for explicitness, or because they're working in a codebase that also uses older versions of Spring where it's still necessary.
