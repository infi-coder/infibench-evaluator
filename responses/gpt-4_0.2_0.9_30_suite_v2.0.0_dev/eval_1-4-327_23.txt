In R, you cannot have two columns with the same name in a data frame. When you use `cbind()` to combine two data frames, if there are columns with the same name, R will automatically rename the columns to make them unique. 

In your case, the second column will be renamed to `a.1`. So, you can select the second column by its new name:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

If you want to keep the original column names, you can convert the data frames to data tables before combining them. The data.table package allows duplicate column names:

```r
library(data.table)

d1 <- data.table(a=c(1,2,3))
d2 <- data.table(a=c(3,4,5))
d3 <- cbind(d1,d2)

second_col <- d3[, .(a = V2)]
```

In this case, you can select the second column by its index (`V2`).
