This issue can be caused by several reasons. Here are some steps you can try:

1. **Clean the build folder**: In Xcode, select `Product > Clean Build Folder`.

2. **Delete derived data**: Go to `Xcode > Preferences > Locations > Derived Data`. Click on the arrow to open the folder in Finder and delete its contents.

3. **Check your scheme**: Make sure that your scheme is set to the correct target. Go to `Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme` and check the `Build` and `Run` sections.

4. **Check your preview struct**: Make sure that your preview struct is within the same `.swift` file as the `View` it's previewing.

5. **Restart Xcode**: Sometimes, simply restarting Xcode can solve the issue.

6. **Update Xcode**: Make sure you're using the latest version of Xcode. Some older versions have known issues with SwiftUI previews.

If none of these steps work, you might want to consider creating a new project and moving your files there.
