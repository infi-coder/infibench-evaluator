This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being associated with a target. Here's how to fix it:

1. Click on the SwiftUI file that contains your preview.
2. In the File Inspector (the first tab in the right sidebar), check if any targets are selected under "Target Membership". If not, select your app's target.

If the issue persists, try these steps:

1. Clean your build folder (Product > Clean Build Folder).
2. Quit Xcode.
3. Delete derived data. You can find the location of your derived data folder in Xcode's preferences (Preferences > Locations > Derived Data). Click on the arrow to open the folder in Finder, then move it to the trash.
4. Restart your computer.
5. Open your project in Xcode and try running the preview again.

If none of these steps work, it might be a bug in Xcode. Consider reporting it to Apple via their Feedback Assistant.
