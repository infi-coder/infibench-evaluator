Your code seems to be correct. However, there are a few things you can check to debug this issue:

1. **Network Connection**: Make sure your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. Sometimes, network issues can cause the query to hang.

2. **Server Status**: Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can test the server by running the query in a GraphQL playground or Postman.

3. **GraphQL Query**: Ensure that the GraphQL query is correct and the server supports it. You can test this by running the query directly on the server using a GraphQL playground.

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (e.g., 3.3.6) to see if the problem persists.

5. **Error Handling**: You might be getting an error but not seeing it. Try logging the error to the console to see if there's an error message:

```javascript
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES);

if (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
}
```

6. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, there might be an issue with the network inspector. Try disabling it and see if the problem persists.

7. **Apollo Client Setup**: Ensure that the Apollo Client is set up correctly. The `uri` should point to your GraphQL server, and the `cache` should be an instance of `InMemoryCache`.

If none of these solutions work, the issue might be more complex and require a deeper investigation.
