You need to specify a `go_package` option in your `.proto` file. This option should be a full import path (which will be used if you're importing this package from other Go code), or a relative path (which will be used if you're not).

Here's how you can modify your `.proto` file:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = ".;main";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

In this case, `.` tells `protoc` to generate the Go code in the current directory, and `main` is the package name.

After this change, you should be able to generate the Go code with the same command:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. simple.proto
```
