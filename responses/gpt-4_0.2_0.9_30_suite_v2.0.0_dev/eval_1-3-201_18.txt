You can use Python's multiprocessing module to run these two tasks concurrently. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
import multiprocessing
from dash import Dash
import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc
import db
import hp
import fd

def run_dash():
    app = Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
    database=db.dataBase()
    homepage=hp.homepage(database)
    homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
    homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()
    app.run_server(debug=True)

def run_data_mining():
    database=db.dataBase()
    dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create processes
    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=run_dash)
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=run_data_mining)

    # Start processes
    p1.start()
    p2.start()

    # Join processes
    p1.join()
    p2.join()
```

This code creates two separate processes, one for running the Dash server and another for running the data mining script. The `multiprocessing.Process` class is used to create a new process. The `start()` method starts the processâ€™s activity and `join()` method makes the main process wait until the processes whose join() method is called terminates.

Please note that the `multiprocessing` module spawning new processes works differently on different platforms. The above code works fine on Unix/Linux. However, on Windows due to lack of `os.fork()`, the child process will import the script containing the target function. Make sure that the script is importable by wrapping the part of the script that's using `multiprocessing` with `if __name__ == "__main__":` to avoid recursively spawning new processes when the script is imported.

Also, be aware that each process will have its own instance of the database object. If you need to share data between processes, you'll need to use a server-based solution, such as a database server or a message queue.
