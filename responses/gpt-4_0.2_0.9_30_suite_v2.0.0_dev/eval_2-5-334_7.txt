You should use `@Configuration` when you want to define beans explicitly in your application. This is typically used when the bean cannot be automatically detected by Spring's component scanning or when you want to create beans conditionally or with specific initialization parameters.

On the other hand, `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Component` are used for automatic detection and configuration of beans. They are typically used when you want Spring to automatically manage the lifecycle of the beans.

- `@Service`: Annotate classes at the service layer level.
- `@Controller`: Annotate classes at the presentation layers level, mainly used in Spring MVC.
- `@Component`: A generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.

So, if you need more control over the bean creation process, use `@Configuration`. If you want Spring to handle it automatically, use `@Service`, `@Controller`, or `@Component`.
