In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, it actually modifies the column names to make them unique. The column names of the resulting data frame would be 'a' and 'a.1'. 

So, you can select the second column by its name 'a.1' as follows:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

However, if you still want to select the second column by its original name 'a', you can use the following code:

```r
second_col <- d3[, "a", drop = FALSE][,2]
```

This code selects all columns named 'a' and then selects the second one. The `drop = FALSE` argument is used to keep the result as a data frame.
