The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the 'year' column in your dataframe contains floating point numbers represented as strings (e.g., '2021.0'). The `int()` function in Python can't directly convert these to integers, hence the ValueError.

You can solve this problem by first converting the 'year' column to float, and then to int. Here's how you can modify your function:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

This function first converts the 'year' column to float, which can handle the '.0' part of the string, and then converts the resulting float to int, effectively removing the decimal part.
