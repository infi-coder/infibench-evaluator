The comment is partially correct. 

A constructor is indeed not a regular function, but it is a special type of method in a class. It is used to initialize the state of an object. The constructor is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It's not invoked like a regular function, but rather when you use the `new` keyword to create an instance of a class.

However, saying "a constructor cannot be called" is not entirely accurate. In some programming languages like JavaScript, you can call a constructor directly using the `call` or `apply` method. But this is not a common practice and usually not recommended because it can lead to confusion and unexpected results.

So, the comment is correct in the sense that constructors are not called like regular functions and are automatically invoked when creating a new object. But it's not entirely correct because in some cases and in some languages, constructors can indeed be called directly.
