The issue you're experiencing is due to the use of single quotes around `$searchT` in your `grep` command. In bash, single quotes preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes, meaning your variable `$searchT` is not being expanded to its value.

Here's how you can fix it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

In this corrected script, I've replaced the single quotes with double quotes around `$searchT` in your `grep` command. This allows the variable to be expanded to its value. 

Also, I've moved `wc -l` to only count the lines from the `grep` command, not the entire file. This will give you the correct count of matches.
