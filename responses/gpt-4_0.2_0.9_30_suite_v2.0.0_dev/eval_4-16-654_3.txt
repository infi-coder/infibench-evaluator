You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by using the `ssh-add` command. However, before you do that, you need to ensure that the SSH agent is running. Here are the steps:

1. Start the ssh-agent in the background:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

2. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace `id_rsa` in the command with the name of your private key file.

```bash
ssh-add D:/keys_folder/id_rsa
```

Replace `id_rsa` with the name of your private key file.

Please note that the path to the key file should not contain any spaces. If the path contains spaces, move the key file to a path without spaces or you might encounter errors.

Also, `ssh-add` command might not work if your key is in putty's `ppk` format. Git Bash understands keys in the `OpenSSH` format. You might need to convert your key to `OpenSSH` format using `PuTTYgen` before adding it to `ssh-agent`.
