The error message you're seeing is typically caused by an HTTP request that is not returning valid JSON. The '<' character at the start of the response suggests that you might be getting an HTML error page instead.

First, ensure that your API is working correctly by testing the endpoint (`/api/Employee/Index`) directly in a browser or using a tool like Postman. If you get a JSON response, then your API is working correctly.

If your API is working correctly, then the issue might be with the URL you're using in your Blazor app. The URL `/api/Employee/Index` is relative to the current page, not the root of the site. If your Blazor app is hosted at a different base address than your API, you'll need to use an absolute URL.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```csharp
empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("https://your-api-url/api/Employee/Index");
```

Replace `https://your-api-url` with the actual URL of your API.

Also, note that `GetJsonAsync` method is obsolete in .NET 5.0+. You should use `GetFromJsonAsync` method from `System.Net.Http.Json` namespace.

```csharp
empList = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<Employee[]>("https://your-api-url/api/Employee/Index");
```

If you're still having issues, please provide more details about your setup, including where your API and Blazor app are hosted, and we can provide more specific advice.
