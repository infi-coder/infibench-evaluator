Use `WillPopScope` instead of `Navigator.pop(context)` or `Navigator.of(context).pop()`. 

`WillPopScope` is a widget that detects when the user has pressed the back button on their device. It has a property called `onWillPop` which is a callback function that will be called when the back button has been pressed. You can override this function to control the behavior of the back button.

Here is a sample code snippet:

```dart
return WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () async => false, // this will disable the back button
  child: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('Login Page'),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: Text('Login Page'),
    ),
  ),
);
```

In this code, `onWillPop` is set to an asynchronous function that always returns false. This effectively disables the back button.
