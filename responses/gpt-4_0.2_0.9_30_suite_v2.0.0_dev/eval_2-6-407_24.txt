The error message you're seeing indicates that the JSON deserializer is trying to parse a response that doesn't start with a valid JSON character. The '<' character at the start of the response suggests that the server might be returning HTML instead of JSON, possibly an error page.

The issue might be due to the route configuration in your `EmployeeController`. You've decorated the `EmployeeController` class with `[Route("[controller]")]` and the `Index` method with `[Route("api/Employee/Index")]`. This could be causing a conflict or confusion in the routing.

Try changing your `EmployeeController` to the following:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class EmployeeController : ControllerBase
{
    EmployeeRepository objemployee = new EmployeeRepository();

    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Employee> Index()
    {
        return objemployee.GetAllEmployees();
    }
}
```

This sets the route for all actions in the `EmployeeController` to start with "api/Employee". The `HttpGet` attribute without any parameters means that the `Index` action corresponds to a GET request to "api/Employee".

Then, in your Blazor code, you can call the API like this:

```csharp
empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("api/Employee");
```

This should correctly call the `Index` action in your `EmployeeController` and return the list of employees as JSON.

If you're still having issues, it might be helpful to use a tool like Postman to test your API and ensure it's returning the expected JSON data.
