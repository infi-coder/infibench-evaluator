The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. That's why you can't install it using `composer require`. 

You need to install it using the PHP extension installation method for your specific operating system. 

Here are the general steps:

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**

1. Update package lists for upgrades and new package installations:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

2. Install the zip extension:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

3. Restart the web server:

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```

**For CentOS/RHEL:**

1. Install the zip extension:

```bash
sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
```

2. Restart the web server:

```bash
sudo service httpd restart
```

**For Windows:**

1. Open your `php.ini` file.
2. Uncomment the line `;extension=php_zip.dll` by removing the semicolon at the start.
3. Save the `php.ini` file and restart your web server.

After you've installed the extension, you can tell Composer that it's installed by adding it to the `require` section of your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer install`.

If you're using Docker, you'll need to add commands to your Dockerfile to install the zip extension.
