In Rust, you can't have a null `Box`. The `Box` type is always non-null. If you want to have an optional `Box`, you should use the `Option<Box<T>>` type. Then you can check if the `Option` is `None`, which would be equivalent to a null pointer in other languages.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

Then, you can check if the `top` is `None` (or "null") like this:

```rust
if let Some(node) = &stack.top {
    // top is not null, do something with node
} else {
    // top is null
}
```

Or like this:

```rust
match &stack.top {
    Some(node) => {
        // top is not null, do something with node
    },
    None => {
        // top is null
    }
}
```

Or like this:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    // top is null
}
```

Remember, in Rust, you don't have null pointers like in C or C++. Instead, you have the `Option` type, which can be `Some(value)` or `None`. This is a safer way to handle the absence of a value, because you have to explicitly handle the `None` case. This helps prevent null pointer dereference bugs.
