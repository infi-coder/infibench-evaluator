The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`. It is part of `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

You should add the reference to `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` in your class file. 

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Then you can use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class.

```csharp
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    // properties
}
```

Make sure you have installed the correct Entity Framework Core package. If not, you can install it via NuGet package manager.

```shell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
```

Also, remember that `[Keyless]` attribute is available starting from EF Core 5.0. If you're using an older version, you might need to upgrade.
