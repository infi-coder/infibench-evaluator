The `sourceMap` option in your `tsconfig.json` file is used to control whether source maps should be generated for your TypeScript files. 

Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. This is useful during development for debugging purposes because it allows you to view and debug the original TypeScript code in your browser's developer tools, even though the browser is actually running the compiled JavaScript code.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, then source maps will not be generated. This means that if you try to debug your code in your browser's developer tools, you will only see the compiled JavaScript code, not the original TypeScript code. This can make debugging more difficult, especially if you're not familiar with the JavaScript code that TypeScript compiles to.

However, in a production environment, you might want to set `"sourceMap": false` to reduce the size of your deployment and to hide your source code from the users of your web app.

So, in short, setting `"sourceMap": false` won't have any visible effect on your app when you run it, but it will affect your debugging experience and the size of your deployed app.
