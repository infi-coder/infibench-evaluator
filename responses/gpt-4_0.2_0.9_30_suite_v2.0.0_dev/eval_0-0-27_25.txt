Your code seems fine at first glance. However, there are a few things you could check to debug this issue:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. Apollo Client fetches data over the network, so a lack of connectivity could cause the loading state to persist.

2. **Server Status**: Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can do this by visiting the URL in a web browser. If the server is down, Apollo Client won't be able to fetch any data.

3. **GraphQL Query**: Make sure that your GraphQL query is correct and the server supports it. You can test your query using a GraphQL client like GraphiQL or Apollo Studio.

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading or upgrading the '@apollo/client' package.

5. **Error Handling**: You're currently logging the `error` object only when `loading` is `true`. However, an error could occur after the loading state is `false`. Try logging the `error` object outside of the `if (loading)` condition to catch any errors that might occur later in the lifecycle.

6. **React Native Debugger**: Use React Native Debugger to inspect the network requests and responses. This can help you identify if the request is being sent correctly and if there's an issue with the response.

7. **Apollo Client Setup**: Ensure that Apollo Client is set up correctly. You can follow the [official Apollo Client setup guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/) to cross-verify your setup.

If none of these suggestions work, please provide more information about the issue, such as any error messages you're seeing and the behavior you're observing.
