To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement a method that returns a `Shader`. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedStyle())
    }
}

struct RedStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        // Implementation here
    }
    
    func _makeView(geometry: _GraphValue<_ShapeStyle_ShapeType>, inputs: _ViewInputs) -> _ViewOutputs {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

However, `ShapeStyle` is not intended to be conformed to directly. It's a protocol that SwiftUI uses to define how shapes are styled. The methods `_apply(to:)` and `_makeView(geometry:inputs:)` are underscored, which means they're considered private and not intended for developers to use.

Instead, you should use one of the types that SwiftUI provides that conform to `ShapeStyle`, such as `Color`, `Gradient`, `AngularGradient`, or `RadialGradient`. If you want to create a custom shape style, you can create a new `View` that returns one of these types.

Here's an example:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedView().color)
    }
}

struct RedView: View {
    var color: some ShapeStyle {
        Color.red
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        color
    }
}
```

In this example, `RedView` has a `color` property that returns a `Color`, which conforms to `ShapeStyle`. You can use this property to fill your `Circle`.
