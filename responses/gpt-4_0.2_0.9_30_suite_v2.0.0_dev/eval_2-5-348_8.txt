The error message you're seeing is due to the way Java handles quotes in command line arguments. The `ProcessBuilder` class, which is used to create and manage processes, has a specific way of handling quotes that can cause issues like the one you're seeing.

One way to solve this problem is to avoid using quotes in your command line arguments. Instead, use the `ProcessBuilder` class's methods to set the command and its arguments. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```java
ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(
    "cmd",
    "/c",
    "C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd",
    "-DskipTests=true",
    "-Dmaven.ext.class.path=C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar",
    "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8",
    "clean",
    "install"
);
pb.directory(new File("C:\\projects\\open"));
Process p = pb.start();
```

This code creates a new `ProcessBuilder` object and sets the command and its arguments using the `ProcessBuilder` constructor. It then sets the working directory using the `directory` method, and finally starts the process using the `start` method.

Note that this code does not include the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. If you need to set this variable, you can do so using the `environment` method of the `ProcessBuilder` class:

```java
Map<String, String> env = pb.environment();
env.put("JAVA_HOME", "C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5");
```

This code gets the current environment variables, adds the `JAVA_HOME` variable, and then sets the environment variables for the process.
