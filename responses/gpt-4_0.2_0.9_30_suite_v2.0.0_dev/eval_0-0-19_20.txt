The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` was not found in the npm registry. This is because there is no package with that exact name in the npm registry.

If you're trying to install the AWS SDK for JavaScript, the correct package name is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`. 

You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

This should resolve your issue.
