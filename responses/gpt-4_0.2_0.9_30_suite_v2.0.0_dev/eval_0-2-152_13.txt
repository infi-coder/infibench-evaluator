You need to call the `toast` method with the `show` option on your toast element to make it appear. Here is how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This code will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event (like a button click), you would need to put this code inside an event handler.

Also, make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JS files in your HTML file. The toast component requires Bootstrap's JavaScript and jQuery. Here is an example of how to include them:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- JS, Popper.js, and jQuery -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Please replace the URLs with the version of Bootstrap you are using.
