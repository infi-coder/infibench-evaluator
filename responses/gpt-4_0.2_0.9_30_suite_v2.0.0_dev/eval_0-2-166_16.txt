Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. It doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would in traditional CSS with the `>` selector. 

Tailwind CSS works by adding utility classes directly to HTML elements. Therefore, you would need to add the classes to the child `div` elements directly.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-red-500"> <!-- Tailwind CSS classes here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="text-lg"> <!-- Tailwind CSS classes here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-red-500` and `text-lg` are Tailwind CSS utility classes added directly to the child `div` elements.

If you need to apply styles to direct children elements based on their parent, you might need to use traditional CSS or preprocessors like Sass, Less in combination with Tailwind CSS.
