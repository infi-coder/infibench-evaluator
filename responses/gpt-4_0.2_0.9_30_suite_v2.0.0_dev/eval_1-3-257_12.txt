Here is a Python function that divides an even number into N parts, each part being a multiple of 2:

```python
def divideNumber(num, n):
    # Calculate the base value and the remainder
    base = num // n
    rem = num % n

    # Ensure the base value is a multiple of 2
    if base % 2 != 0:
        base -= 1
        rem += n

    # Create the result list with the base value
    result = [base] * n

    # Distribute the remainder
    i = 0
    while rem > 0:
        result[i] += 2
        rem -= 2
        i = (i + 1) % n

    return result
```

This function first calculates the base value and the remainder of the division. It then ensures that the base value is a multiple of 2. If it's not, it decreases the base value by 1 and increases the remainder accordingly. It then creates a list with the base value and distributes the remainder by adding 2 to each element in the list in a round-robin fashion.

Here is how you can use this function:

```python
print(divideNumber(100, 3))  # Output: [34, 34, 32]
```

This function works for any even number and any number of parts. Note that if the number of parts is greater than the number itself, the result will contain zeros.
