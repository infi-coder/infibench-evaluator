The error message is telling you that you can't use a navigation property (`Gender`) as an index. You should use the foreign key (`GenderId`) instead. 

Here is the corrected code:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `HasIndex(x => x.GenderId)` is used to create an index on the `GenderId` column in the `User` table. This can improve the performance of queries that filter or sort by `GenderId`.
