The error message you're seeing is due to a change in Android 12 (API level 31) that requires you to specify one of `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` or `FLAG_MUTABLE` when creating a `PendingIntent`.

The `MediaSessionCompat` class in the AndroidX Media library creates a `PendingIntent` internally, and it seems like it's not setting one of these flags. This is likely a bug in the library.

While the library's code does have a TODO comment about using `FLAG_MUTABLE` for Android S and later, it seems like this hasn't been implemented yet.

As a workaround, you can try downgrading your target SDK version to 30 until the library is updated to handle this requirement. You can do this by changing the `targetSdkVersion` in your app's `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 31
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.example.myapp"
        minSdkVersion 21
        targetSdkVersion 30
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
    ...
}
```

This will allow your app to still compile against the latest Android SDK, but it won't be subject to the behavior changes in Android 12, including the requirement to specify `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` or `FLAG_MUTABLE` when creating a `PendingIntent`.

Remember to monitor updates to the AndroidX Media library and update your `targetSdkVersion` to 31 once the library is updated to handle this requirement.
