This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being associated with the correct target. Here are some steps to resolve this:

1. Open your SwiftUI file.
2. Click on the file name at the top of the editor.
3. Click on "Show File Inspector" (the first tab on the right panel).
4. Under "Target Membership", make sure your app's target is checked.

If the problem persists, try cleaning the build folder (`Product -> Clean Build Folder`) and restarting Xcode.

If none of these work, it might be a bug with Xcode 12.3. You can try updating to a newer version of Xcode or downgrading to a stable version.
