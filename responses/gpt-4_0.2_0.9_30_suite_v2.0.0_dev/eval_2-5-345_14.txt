This error is due to a compatibility issue between the IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version that comes with the Spring Boot 2.7.0 project. The Maven version 3.8.5 is not yet fully supported by IntelliJ IDEA.

To resolve this issue, you can downgrade the Maven version to 3.8.4 or earlier, which is compatible with IntelliJ IDEA. 

Here are the steps to change the Maven version:

1. Navigate to the `pom.xml` file in your project.

2. Look for the `maven-wrapper` plugin. It should look something like this:

    ```xml
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-wrapper-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.2</version>
        <configuration>
            <maven>3.8.5</maven>
        </configuration>
    </plugin>
    ```

3. Change the version in the `<maven>` tag to `3.8.4` or earlier. For example:

    ```xml
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-wrapper-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.2</version>
        <configuration>
            <maven>3.8.4</maven>
        </configuration>
    </plugin>
    ```

4. Save the changes and re-import the project in IntelliJ IDEA.

This should resolve the issue. If the problem persists, consider updating your IntelliJ IDEA to the latest version or contacting JetBrains support for further assistance.
