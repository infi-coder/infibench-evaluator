Sure, here is your revised code:

```javascript
const MongoStore = require('connect-mongo');

...

app.use(session({
    secret: 'story book',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: MongoStore.create({ mongoUrl: process.env.MONGODB_URI })
}))
```
The `connect-mongo` package has changed its API in version 4. Now, instead of calling it as a function with the `session` argument, you just require it directly. The `create` method is used to create a new store, and the `mongooseConnection` option has been replaced with `mongoUrl`.
