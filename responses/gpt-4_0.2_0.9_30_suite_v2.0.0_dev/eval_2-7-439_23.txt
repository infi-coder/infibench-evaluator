The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. This means you cannot install it using `composer require`. Instead, you need to install it using the PHP extension installation method for your operating system.

Here's how you can install it on different operating systems:

**Ubuntu/Debian**

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

**CentOS/RHEL**

```bash
sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
```

**macOS (using brew)**

```bash
brew install php@7.3
brew link --overwrite --force php@7.3
```

**Windows**

For Windows, you need to enable the extension in your `php.ini` file. Uncomment (or add) the line:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing the extension, you may need to restart your web server for the changes to take effect.

In your `composer.json`, you can specify that your project requires this extension with:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1",
    "ext-zip": "*"
}
```

This won't install the extension, but when someone tries to install your project using Composer, they will get a warning if they don't have the `ext-zip` extension installed.
