The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server not being accessible from outside of the Docker container. By default, Vite's server only listens on the localhost interface. To make it accessible from outside of the Docker container, you need to configure it to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0).

You can do this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, making the server accessible from outside of the Docker container. After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server from your host machine.
