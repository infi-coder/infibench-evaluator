Sure, here is the corrected version of your function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        pig_latin_word = word[1:] + word[0] + 'ay'
        pig_latin_words.append(pig_latin_word)
    return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)
```

In your original code, you were returning the first transformed word immediately in the loop, which is why you were only getting one word in the output. Instead, you should append each transformed word to a list and then join them into a string at the end.
