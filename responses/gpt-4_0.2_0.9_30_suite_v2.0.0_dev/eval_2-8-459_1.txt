The error message you're seeing indicates that Go is unable to find the specified version of the module in the repository. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as network issues, incorrect configuration, or access restrictions.

Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. **Check your network connection**: Make sure that you have a stable internet connection and that you're able to access the repository from your current network.

2. **Verify the module version**: Ensure that the version of the module you're trying to use actually exists in the repository. You can do this by visiting the repository and checking the list of tags or releases.

3. **Check your access permissions**: Even though you have access to the domain, you might not have access to the specific repository. Verify that you have the necessary permissions to access the repository and the specific version of the module.

4. **Check your Go configuration**: Go uses the `GOPROXY` environment variable to determine where to download modules from. By default, this is set to `https://proxy.golang.org`, but it can be configured to use other proxies or to download modules directly from their repositories. You can check the current value of `GOPROXY` by running `go env GOPROXY` in the terminal. If you're working with private repositories, you might need to set `GOPROXY` to `direct` or configure it to use a proxy that has access to the repository.

5. **Check your Git configuration**: If you're using Git to download modules, you might need to configure it to use the correct credentials when accessing private repositories. You can do this by using the `git config` command or by setting the `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT` environment variable to `1` to enable Git's credential prompt.

6. **Enable Go's debug mode**: Go has a debug mode that provides more detailed output when downloading modules. You can enable this by setting the `GODEBUG` environment variable to `modfetch=2`. This might help you identify the exact cause of the issue.

Here's how you can set these environment variables:

```bash
export GOPROXY=direct
export GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=1
export GODEBUG=modfetch=2
```

After setting these variables, try running `go build` again and see if the issue is resolved. If not, the output should provide more information that can help you debug the issue.
