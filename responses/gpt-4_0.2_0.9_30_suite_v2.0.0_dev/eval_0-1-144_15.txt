You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This pseudo-element is responsible for the arrow.

Here is an example of how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may want to include vendor prefixes for older browsers */
    color: green;
}
```

However, Bootstrap uses a background-image for the accordion arrows, not a font icon, so changing the color via CSS won't work. You'll need to override the background-image with your own image or use a Unicode character as an arrow.

Here is an example of how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    content: "\25B2"; /* Unicode character for arrow */
    color: green;
}

.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    content: "\25BC"; /* Unicode character for arrow */
    color: green;
}
```

In this example, `\25B2` is the Unicode for an up arrow and `\25BC` is for a down arrow. The color of these arrows will be green.
