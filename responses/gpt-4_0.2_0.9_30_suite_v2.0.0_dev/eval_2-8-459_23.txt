This issue might be due to a few reasons:

1. **Incorrect or missing credentials:** Even though you mentioned that your GitHub credentials give you access to these repos, it's worth double-checking. Make sure you have the correct access rights to the private repository.

2. **Proxy settings:** If you're using a proxy, it might be causing the issue. You can try disabling it or configuring it correctly.

3. **Go version:** Ensure that you're using the same Go version on both computers. Different Go versions might handle dependencies differently.

4. **Network issues:** There might be network issues preventing Go from accessing the repository.

To debug this issue, you can try the following:

- **Verbose logging:** Use the `-v` flag with `go get` or `go build` to get more detailed logs.

    ```bash
    go get -v github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
    ```

- **Check the GOPROXY environment variable:** The GOPROXY environment variable controls where Go fetches its modules from. You can print its value using:

    ```bash
    echo $GOPROXY
    ```

    If it's not set to `direct`, you can try setting it to `direct` and then try building your program again.

    ```bash
    export GOPROXY=direct
    ```

- **Check the GOSUMDB environment variable:** The GOSUMDB environment variable controls where Go checks for module checksums. If it's set to `off`, Go won't check for checksums, which might cause issues. You can print its value using:

    ```bash
    echo $GOSUMDB
    ```

    If it's set to `off`, you can try setting it to `sum.golang.org` and then try building your program again.

    ```bash
    export GOSUMDB=sum.golang.org
    ```

- **Check the GIT configuration:** Ensure that the git configuration is correctly set up to access private repositories. You can check your git configuration using:

    ```bash
    git config --list
    ```

    If you're using SSH to access your repositories, ensure that your SSH keys are correctly set up.

- **Check the network:** Try accessing the repository URL directly from your browser or using `curl` to see if there are any network issues.
