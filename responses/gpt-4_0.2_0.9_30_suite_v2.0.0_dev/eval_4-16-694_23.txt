You can use `awk` to extract the language code from the `lang` attribute. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | cut -d'"' -f2
```

This command does the following:

1. `curl -Ls stick-it.app`: Fetches the content of the webpage.
2. `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'`: Searches for the `lang` attribute and its value. The `-o` option tells `grep` to only output the matches, not the entire line.
3. `cut -d'"' -f2`: Splits the output on the `"` character and selects the second field, which is the language code.

This command should work regardless of where the `lang` attribute is located in the `<html>` tag. It will also correctly handle language codes that include a region code (like `he-IL`).
