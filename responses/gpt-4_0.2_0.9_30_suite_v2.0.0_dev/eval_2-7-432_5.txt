The error you're seeing is due to Laravel's built-in CSRF protection. When you log out from one tab, the session is invalidated, and the CSRF token associated with the session becomes invalid as well. So when you try to log out from the other tab, Laravel throws a 419 error because the CSRF token is no longer valid.

To handle this, you can catch the `TokenMismatchException` in your `Handler.php` file and redirect the user to the login page. Here's how you can do it:

```php
// app/Exceptions/Handler.php

public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof \Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException) {
        return redirect('/login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

This code will catch the `TokenMismatchException` and redirect the user to the login page. This way, if a user tries to log out from a tab where the session has already been invalidated, they will just be redirected to the login page instead of seeing the 419 error page.

Please note that this is a simple solution and might not be suitable for all use cases. For example, if you have forms in your application that can take a long time to fill out, this solution could lead to data loss if the session expires before the form is submitted. In such cases, you might want to implement a more sophisticated solution, like AJAX-based session renewal.
