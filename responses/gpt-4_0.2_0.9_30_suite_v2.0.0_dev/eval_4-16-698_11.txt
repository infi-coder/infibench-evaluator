You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command reads and executes commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, those changes will be applied to your current terminal session.

If you're using zsh (which is the default shell in macOS Catalina and later), you should use:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

This is equivalent to `exec bash` in Linux, which replaces the current shell with a new one.
