You can use `awk` to extract the language code. Here is a modified version of your command:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | cut -d'"' -f2
```

This command does the following:

- `curl -Ls stick-it.app` fetches the content of the page.
- `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'` extracts the `lang` attribute. The `-o` option tells `grep` to only output the matched part of the line. The regular expression `lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"` matches the `lang` attribute and its value.
- `cut -d'"' -f2` splits the output on the `"` character and selects the second field, which is the language code.

This command should work regardless of the position of the `lang` attribute in the tag.
