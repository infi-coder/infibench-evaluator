You can use `awk` to extract the language code. Here's how you can modify your command:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | head -1 | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'
```

This command does the following:

- `curl -Ls stick-it.app` fetches the content of the page.
- `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'` extracts the `lang` attribute value. The `-o` option tells `grep` to print only the matched parts of a matching line. The regular expression `'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'` matches the `lang` attribute and its value.
- `head -1` gets the first match.
- `awk -F'"' '{print $2}'` splits the line by the `"` character and prints the second field, which is the language code.

This command should work for any page and any language code format.
