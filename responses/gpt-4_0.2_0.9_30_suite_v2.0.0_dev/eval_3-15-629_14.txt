You can use the `DataObject` object in VBA to copy text to the clipboard. Here's an example:

```vba
Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject

DataObj.SetText Me.NodeKey.Value
DataObj.PutInClipboard
```

This will copy the value of `Me.NodeKey.Value` to the clipboard. 

Please note that you need to set a reference to `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library` to use `DataObject`. You can do this by going to `Tools -> References` in the VBA editor and checking `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library`.

If you don't see `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library`, you can browse for `FM20.DLL` in your system (usually it's in the `C:\Windows\System32` directory) and add it manually.
