The `rename` function is used to rename the DataFrame's index or columns directly, not the Series. In your case, the `groupby` operation returns a Series, not a DataFrame. That's why you're getting a `TypeError`.

You can convert the Series to a DataFrame first, then rename the column. Here is the function `renameDataFrame`:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg = avg.rename(columns={"p": "mean"})
    return avg
```

In this function, `reset_index()` is used to convert the Series to a DataFrame, and then `rename` is used to rename the column.
