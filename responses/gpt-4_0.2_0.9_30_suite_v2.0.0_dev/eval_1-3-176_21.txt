The error message indicates that the zlib library, which is a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source, could not be found. 

However, the Pillow version you are trying to install (6.0.0) does not support Python 3.8, which is the Python version you are using. This is mentioned in the warning message in your error log:

```bash
C:\Users\rijal\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-install-di5is9gd\Pillow\setup.py:29: RuntimeWarning: Pillow does not yet support Python 3.8 and does not yet provide prebuilt Windows binaries. We do not recommend building from source on Windows.
```

To solve this issue, you should install a more recent version of Pillow that supports Python 3.8. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pillow
```

This command will install the latest version of Pillow. If you still encounter issues, it might be a problem with your Python installation or your environment, and you might need to reinstall Python or create a new virtual environment.
