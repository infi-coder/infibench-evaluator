It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a web-developerâ€™s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow: it allows you to type CSS-like expressions that can be dynamically parsed and produce output depending on what you typed in the abbreviation.

For example, if you type `.classname` and press `Tab`, it will automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

Here are the steps to use Emmet in some popular code editors:

**Visual Studio Code:**

1. Open a new `.html` file.
2. Type your Emmet abbreviation, for example, `.classname`.
3. Press `Tab` to expand the abbreviation.

**Sublime Text:**

1. Open a new `.html` file.
2. Type your Emmet abbreviation, for example, `.classname`.
3. Press `Tab` to expand the abbreviation.

**Atom:**

1. Open a new `.html` file.
2. Type your Emmet abbreviation, for example, `.classname`.
3. Press `Tab` to expand the abbreviation.

If it's not working, make sure that:

1. You're in an HTML file (the file extension should be `.html`).
2. Your code editor supports Emmet. Most modern code editors do, but you may need to install a plugin or extension.
3. You're not making a syntax error. For example, `.classname{}` won't work because `{}` is not valid Emmet syntax.
4. You're pressing the correct key to expand the abbreviation. In most cases, this is the `Tab` key, but in some editors, it may be different.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more details about your setup (e.g., which code editor you're using), and I'll be happy to help further!
