The error message indicates that npm is unable to find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry. The 404 status code in the error message stands for "Not Found", which means the requested resource could not be found on the server.

The `aws-sdk-js` package does not exist in the npm registry. If you are trying to install the AWS SDK for JavaScript, the correct package name is `aws-sdk`. 

You can install it by running:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

This should resolve the issue.
