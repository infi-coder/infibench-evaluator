To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement a function that provides a `Shader` for the shape. Here is how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedStyle())
    }
}

struct RedStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        // provide a shader for the shape
    }
    
    func _makeView(geometry: _GraphValue<_ShapeLayout>, inputs: _ViewInputs) -> _ViewOutputs {
        // create a view for the shape
    }
}
```

However, `_apply(to:)` and `_makeView(geometry:inputs:)` are internal methods, and you're not supposed to override them. SwiftUI doesn't provide a public API to create custom `ShapeStyle`s.

So, in practice, you can't conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol. You should use existing types that conform to `ShapeStyle`, like `Color`, `Gradient`, `AngularGradient`, and `RadialGradient`.
