In Rust, all fields of a struct must be initialized when the struct is created. However, `TcpStream` does not have a default value that you can use. 

One common way to handle this situation is to use `Option<TcpStream>`. This allows you to set `conn` to `None` initially, and then set it to `Some(stream)` when you connect.

Here is how you can modify your code:

```rust
use std::net::TcpStream;
use std::io;

pub struct FistClient {
    addr: String,
    conn: Option<TcpStream>,
}

impl FistClient {
    pub fn new(ip: &str, port: &str) -> Self {
        FistClient {
            addr: String::from(ip) + ":" + &String::from(port),
            conn: None,
        }
    }

    pub fn connect(&mut self) -> io::Result<()> {
        match TcpStream::connect(&self.addr) {
            Ok(c) => {
                self.conn = Some(c);
                Ok(())
            },
            Err(e) => Err(e),
        }
    }
}
```

In the `connect` method, I've changed the return type to `io::Result<()>` so that it returns an error instead of panicking when the connection fails. This allows the caller to handle the error. 

To use the `conn` field, you will need to check if it is `Some` and then unwrap it. If it is `None`, you can decide what to do (for example, you might want to connect again).
