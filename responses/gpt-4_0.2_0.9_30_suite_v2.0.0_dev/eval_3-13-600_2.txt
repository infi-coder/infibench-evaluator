You can disable the swipe animation in ViewPager2 by using a custom `ViewPager2.PageTransformer`. Here's an example:

```kotlin
viewPager2.setPageTransformer(new ViewPager2.PageTransformer() {
    @Override
    public void transformPage(@NonNull View page, float position) {
        page.setTranslationX(-position * page.getWidth());
    }
});
```

This transformer will cancel out the default swipe animation, making it appear as if the new page just appears without any transition.

However, please note that this will also disable the swipe animation when the user manually swipes between pages. If you want to keep the swipe animation for manual swipes, you'll need to implement a more complex solution, such as temporarily disabling the transformer when the user is manually swiping.
