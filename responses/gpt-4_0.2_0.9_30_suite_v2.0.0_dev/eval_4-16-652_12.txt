AWS CLI uses a pager program to handle its output. By default, it uses the `less` program. If you want to disable this feature, you can do it in several ways:

1. **Set the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string**. This will disable the pager for the current session. You can do this by running the following command before running your script:

    ```bash
    export AWS_PAGER=""
    ```

2. **Set the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable in your script**. This will disable the pager only for the execution of your script:

    ```bash
    for x in 1 2 3; do 
      AWS_PAGER="" aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
    done
    ```

3. **Redirect the output to `/dev/null`**. This will discard all the output from the command:

    ```bash
    for x in 1 2 3; do 
      aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > /dev/null; 
    done
    ```

4. **Redirect the output to a file**. This will save all the output from the command to a file:

    ```bash
    for x in 1 2 3; do 
      aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > output.txt; 
    done
    ```

Remember that if you set the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable, it will affect all the AWS CLI commands in the current session or in your script, not only the `purge-queue` command.
