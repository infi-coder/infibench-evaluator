The error message `fork/exec /var/task/main: no such file or directory` is indicating that AWS Lambda is unable to find the executable file. This is likely due to the fact that you're building the Go binary on a Windows machine, which will not be compatible with the Linux environment that AWS Lambda uses.

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code for a Linux environment. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables before building your Go code. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -o main main.go
```

This will create a `main` binary that is compatible with the Linux environment used by AWS Lambda.

After that, you need to zip the `main` binary (not `main.exe`) and upload it to AWS Lambda:

```bash
zip function.zip main
```

Then, upload `function.zip` to AWS Lambda and set the handler name to `main`.

This should solve the issue and your Lambda function should be able to execute the Go code without any problems.
