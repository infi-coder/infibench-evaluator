Font Awesome 5 has made some changes in the way it is used compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is now split into different styles: `Font Awesome 5 Free`, `Font Awesome 5 Brands`, and `Font Awesome 5 Pro`. The `content` values have also changed for some icons.

The `content: "\f107";` corresponds to the `angle-down` icon in Font Awesome 4. In Font Awesome 5, the `angle-down` icon is represented by `content: "\f107";` in the `Font Awesome 5 Free` and `Font Awesome 5 Pro` font families, but the font-weight needs to be set to 900.

Here is how you can update your CSS to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* Update the font-family */
  font-weight: 900; /* Add this line */
}
```

If you are using the Pro version, replace `"Font Awesome 5 Free"` with `"Font Awesome 5 Pro"`.

Remember to include the Font Awesome 5 CSS in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.13/css/all.css">
```

Also, make sure that you have the correct version of Font Awesome 5 linked in your project. The version in the link above is `5.0.13`, but you should replace it with the version you are using.
