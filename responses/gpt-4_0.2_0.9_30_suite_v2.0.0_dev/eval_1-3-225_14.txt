Sure, here is the revised version of your function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    result = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:] + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
        result.append(endString)
    return ' '.join(result)
```

This function splits the input text into words, then for each word, it moves the first character to the end and appends "ay". The transformed words are then joined back together with spaces in between to form the final result.
