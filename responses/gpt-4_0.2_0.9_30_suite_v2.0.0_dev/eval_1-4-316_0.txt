The error you're getting is because `sort()` function in R doesn't work directly on lists. However, you can unlist the list, sort it and then convert it back to a list. Here is the function `mySort` that does this:

```r
mySort <- function(l) {
  sorted_vector = sort(unlist(l))
  sorted_list = as.list(sorted_vector)
  return(sorted_list)
}
```

You can use this function to sort your list as follows:

```r
sorted_list = mySort(list_text_data)
```

This will return a sorted list of your letters.
