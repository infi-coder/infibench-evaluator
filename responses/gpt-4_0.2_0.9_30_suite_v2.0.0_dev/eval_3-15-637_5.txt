The error you're experiencing could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your SeleniumBasic version**: Ensure that you have the latest version of SeleniumBasic installed. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/florentbr/SeleniumBasic/releases).

2. **Check your browser driver**: Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Make sure you have the correct driver for the browser you're using, and that it's up-to-date. For Internet Explorer, you can download the driver from [here](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/).

3. **Check your browser version**: Ensure that your browser (in this case Internet Explorer) is up-to-date.

4. **Check your SeleniumBasic references in VBA**: In VBA, go to `Tools > References` and make sure that Selenium Type Library is checked.

5. **Try using a different browser**: Internet Explorer is somewhat outdated and might not work properly with Selenium. Try using a more modern browser like Chrome or Firefox.

If none of these solutions work, it would be helpful if you could provide the exact error message you're receiving. This would make it easier to diagnose the problem.
