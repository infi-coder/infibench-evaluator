The issue you're encountering is due to changes in Android 12 (API level 31) regarding `PendingIntent`. Starting from this version, you must explicitly specify whether the `PendingIntent` is mutable or immutable by using `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` or `FLAG_MUTABLE`.

The error is thrown because the `MediaSessionCompat` class is trying to create a `PendingIntent` without specifying these flags. This is a known issue with the AndroidX Media library version 1.4.0 and below.

The Android team has fixed this issue in the AndroidX Media library version 1.4.1 and above. So, you should update your dependency to the latest version to resolve this issue.

In your `build.gradle` file, update the version of the AndroidX Media library:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.media:media:1.4.3'
}
```

After updating the library, sync your project with Gradle files and the issue should be resolved.
