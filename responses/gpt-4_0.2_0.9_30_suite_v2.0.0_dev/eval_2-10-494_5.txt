The error message "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args`" is coming from the Rust Analyzer, which is a language server protocol implementation for Rust. It's used by many editors to provide features like autocompletion, goto definition, and error checking.

This error message suggests that Rust Analyzer is having trouble resolving the `format_args` macro, which is used internally by the `assert_eq` macro in your test. This is likely not a problem with your code, but rather a problem with Rust Analyzer itself.

Here are a few things you can try to fix this issue:

1. **Update Rust Analyzer**: If you're using an old version of Rust Analyzer, it might have bugs that have been fixed in newer versions. Check if there's an update available and install it if there is.

2. **Restart your editor**: Sometimes, Rust Analyzer can get into a bad state, and restarting your editor can fix the problem.

3. **Check your Rust toolchain**: Make sure you're using a recent stable version of the Rust toolchain. You can update your toolchain with `rustup update`.

4. **Disable and re-enable Rust Analyzer**: If all else fails, you can try disabling Rust Analyzer, restarting your editor, and then re-enabling Rust Analyzer.

Remember, the fact that `cargo check`, `cargo run`, and `cargo test` all work means that your code is fine. The problem is with the tooling, not with your code.
