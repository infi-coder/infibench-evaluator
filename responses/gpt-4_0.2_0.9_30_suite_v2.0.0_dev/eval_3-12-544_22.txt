The error you're encountering is because you're trying to access platform-specific code before `runApp()` is called. The `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` method must be called first in order to initialize the binding, which is required for using platform channels.

Here's how you can fix your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // add this line
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This ensures that the widget binding is initialized before you try to use the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` method.
