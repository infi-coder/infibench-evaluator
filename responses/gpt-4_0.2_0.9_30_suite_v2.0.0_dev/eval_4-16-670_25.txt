Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` tool. Here is the command you can use:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for your passphrase (if you have one), and then it will write the RSA private key out to the same file (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

To explain the command:

- `-p` allows you to change the passphrase of a private key file.
- `-m PEM` specifies the format of the key. PEM is the format that begins with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.
- `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file of the key.

As for your second question, you do not need to convert your public key. The public key does not have a header like the private key, and it can be used with either the OpenSSH or RSA private key.
