Assuming that the line you want to split is a string with values separated by spaces (or any other delimiter), you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the string into an array and then assign each array element to a cell in Excel.

Here is how you can modify your code:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitText As Variant
    splitText = Split(textline, " ") 'Assuming space is the delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitText(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitText(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitText(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitText(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitText(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code will split the `textline` into 5 parts based on the space delimiter and put each part into a separate cell in the same row. Please adjust the delimiter and the indices of `splitText` array according to your actual data.
