This error is caused by a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version (3.8.5) that comes with Spring Boot 2.7. IntelliJ IDEA does not yet fully support this version of Maven.

Here are a few possible solutions:

1. **Downgrade Maven version**: You can manually downgrade the Maven version in your project to a version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by modifying the `pom.xml` file in your project. Change the `maven` version in the `properties` section to a lower version (e.g., 3.8.4 or lower).

2. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: JetBrains regularly releases updates for IntelliJ IDEA to support the latest versions of different tools including Maven. Check if there is an update available for your IntelliJ IDEA and install it.

3. **Use IntelliJ IDEA's bundled Maven**: IntelliJ IDEA comes with a bundled Maven that is guaranteed to be compatible. You can switch to use this version instead. To do this, go to `Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven`. Under `Maven home directory`, select the bundled version.

Remember to re-import your project after making these changes.
