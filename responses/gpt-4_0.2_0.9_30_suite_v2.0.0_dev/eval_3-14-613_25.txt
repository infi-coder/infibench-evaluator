This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being associated with any target. Here's how you can fix it:

1. Open your SwiftUI file.
2. Click on the file name in the navigation bar at the top of the editor.
3. In the file inspector on the right, ensure that the target membership checkbox is checked for your app's target.

If the problem persists, try these steps:

1. Clean your build folder (Product -> Clean Build Folder).
2. Restart Xcode.
3. If necessary, restart your Mac.

If none of these solutions work, it might be a bug in Xcode. You can report it to Apple via their Feedback Assistant.
