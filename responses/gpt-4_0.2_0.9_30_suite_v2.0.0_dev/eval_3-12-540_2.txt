Yes, in Flutter, you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here's a simple example of how you can use it:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line is drawn between two text components. The `VerticalDivider` widget takes several parameters:

- `color`: This defines the color of the line. 
- `thickness`: This defines the thickness of the line. 
- `width`: This defines the total width of the divider, including the empty space on either side of the line.

Please note that the `VerticalDivider` widget can only be used inside a `Row` widget. If you try to use it in a `Column` widget, it will not be visible because it will have a height of 0.
