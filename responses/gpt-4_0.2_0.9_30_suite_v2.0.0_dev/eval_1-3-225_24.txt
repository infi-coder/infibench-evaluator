Sure, here's your revised code:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    result = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:] + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
        result.append(endString)
    return ' '.join(result)
```

This function splits the input text into words, then for each word, it moves the first character to the end, appends "ay", and adds the result to a list. Finally, it joins the list into a single string with spaces in between the words.
