The error message you're seeing is related to a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the version of Maven that's being used in your project. 

The issue is that IntelliJ IDEA is trying to use a class (`org.apache.maven.model.validation.DefaultModelValidator`) that has been removed or changed in the newer version of Maven (3.8.5) that comes with Spring Boot 2.7.

Here are a few possible solutions:

1. **Downgrade Maven version in your project**: You can change the Maven version in your project to an older version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by modifying the `pom.xml` file in your project.

2. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: JetBrains, the company behind IntelliJ IDEA, regularly releases updates to their IDEs to fix bugs and compatibility issues. You can check if there's an update available for IntelliJ IDEA and install it.

3. **Use IntelliJ IDEA's bundled Maven**: IntelliJ IDEA comes with a bundled version of Maven that should work out of the box. You can switch to using this version of Maven in the settings: `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven`.

Remember to restart IntelliJ IDEA after making these changes to ensure they take effect.
