Sure, here is a bash script to install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current version of Python
brew unlink python

# Install the required version of Python
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed version of Python
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that you need to replace `3.6` with the version number you want to install. Also, this script assumes that you have Homebrew installed on your macOS. If not, you need to install it first.
