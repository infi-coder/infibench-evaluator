Sure, you can't directly combine two mapped types in TypeScript. Instead, you can use intersection (`&`) to combine them. Here is the correct definition:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type where each fruit has a numeric property and each color has a boolean property.
