Here is a Python function that does what you want. This function creates a dictionary that maps the first four elements of `b` to the elements in `rest`. Then it goes through the `last` list and replaces any element that is in the dictionary with its corresponding value.

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    # Create a dictionary that maps the first four elements of b to rest
    map_dict = {b[i]: rest[i] for i in range(4)}
    
    # Replace elements in last according to the dictionary
    last = [map_dict.get(i, i) for i in last]
    
    return last
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

print(ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last))
```

This will output:

```python
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

This function assumes that the `rest` list has at least as many elements as the number of elements you want to replace in `b`. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the function to handle this situation.
