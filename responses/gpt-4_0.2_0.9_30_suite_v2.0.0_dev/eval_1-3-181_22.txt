Here is a Python function that does what you need:

```python
import numpy as np

def getMax(matrix):
    # Select the third column from each 2D array in the 3D array
    third_column = matrix[:,:,2]
    # Find the max value in each selected column
    max_values = np.max(third_column, axis=1)
    # Reshape the result to a 2D array
    max_values = max_values.reshape(-1, 1)
    return max_values
```

This function works by first selecting the third column from each 2D array in the 3D array. Then, it finds the max value in each selected column. Finally, it reshapes the result to a 2D array.

Here is how you can use this function:

```python
matrix = np.array([[[4, 1, 5, 2, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 7],
                    [7, 4, 2, 4, 7, 8, 4, 1, 3, 5],
                    [6, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6],
                    [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 3, 8, 7, 1],
                    [2, 8, 6, 7, 4, 7, 5, 5, 5, 1]],

                   [[9, 9, 5, 8, 0, 7, 3, 9, 8, 1],
                    [9, 1, 9, 5, 7, 4, 5, 4, 7, 0],
                    [1, 0, 4, 8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 8, 8],
                    [8, 1, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 9, 3, 8],
                    [4, 0, 2, 3, 8, 2, 0, 1, 2, 4]],

                   [[1, 6, 2, 4, 4,
