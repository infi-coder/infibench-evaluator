You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This pseudo-element is responsible for the arrow. Here is the CSS code:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may want to include vendor prefixes for older browsers */
    color: green;
}
```

However, Bootstrap 5 uses a background-image for the accordion arrows, not a color. So, you might not be able to change the color directly. Instead, you can override the default arrow with your own. Here is an example:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* Reset the default arrow */
    background-image: none;
    /* Add your own arrow */
    content: 'â–¼';
    /* Set the color */
    color: green;
    /* Adjust the position if needed */
    position: relative;
    top: 0;
    /* Add a transition if you want the arrow to rotate when the accordion is open */
    transition: transform 0.6s ease;
}

/* Rotate the arrow when the accordion is open */
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    transform: rotate(180deg);
}
```

This will replace the default arrow with a text arrow, which you can color as you like. Adjust the position and rotation to fit your design.
