AWS CLI version 2 introduced a feature where the output is paged through `less` by default. This can be changed by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string.

You can add `export AWS_PAGER=""` to your bash script to disable the pager:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""

for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will disable the pager for the duration of the script.

If you want to disable the pager permanently, you can add `export AWS_PAGER=""` to your shell profile file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash, `~/.zshrc` for zsh, etc.) and then source the file or restart your shell.

```bash
echo 'export AWS_PAGER=""' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

This will disable the pager for all future terminal sessions.
