The error you're seeing is because the 'year' column contains floating point numbers represented as strings (e.g., '2021.0'). The `int()` function in Python can't directly convert these to integers, because it doesn't know how to handle the decimal point.

To fix this, you can first convert the strings to floats, and then convert the floats to integers. Here's how you can modify your function to do this:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

This function first converts the 'year' column to floats, then to integers. This handles the decimal point in the strings, and should prevent the `ValueError` you were seeing.
