The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vite's server is binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) inside the Docker container by default. This means it's only accessible from within the Docker container itself, not from your host machine or any other Docker container.

To make the Vite server accessible from outside the Docker container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0` (which means all network interfaces). You can do this by adding `host: '0.0.0.0'` to the `server` section of your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0',
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This should make your Vite server accessible from your host machine at `localhost:8080`.
