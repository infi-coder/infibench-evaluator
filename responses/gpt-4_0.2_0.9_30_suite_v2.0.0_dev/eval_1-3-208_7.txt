Sure, the problem with your code is that you're checking if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, not if each character of the input string is in the `correct` string. Here's how you can modify your code to check each character:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(c in correct for c in text)
```

This function uses the `all` function, which returns `True` if all elements in the given iterable are true. In this case, the iterable is a generator expression that checks if each character `c` in `text` is in the `correct` string. If any character is not in the `correct` string, `all` will return `False`. If all characters are in the `correct` string, `all` will return `True`.

You can use this function like this:

```python
text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

This will print "Success" if all characters in the input string are either a letter or a digit, and "Failure" otherwise.
