The issue with your script is that you're using single quotes around `$searchT` in your `grep` command. Single quotes in bash will prevent variable expansion, meaning `$searchT` is being treated as a literal string, not a variable. 

You should use double quotes instead. Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

This script will now correctly use the value of `searchT` in the `grep` command. 

Also, note that I moved the `| wc -l` command to only count the lines from the `grep` command, not the entire `cat` command. This will give you the correct number of matches.
