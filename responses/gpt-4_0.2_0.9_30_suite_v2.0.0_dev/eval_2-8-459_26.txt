The error message you're seeing indicates that Go is unable to find the specified version of the module. This could be due to a number of reasons, including network issues, incorrect configuration, or the specified version not existing.

Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. **Check your network connection**: Make sure that you have a stable internet connection and that you're able to access the repository from your browser.

2. **Check your Go version**: Ensure that you're using the same Go version on both computers. You can check your Go version by running `go version` in your terminal.

3. **Check your Go environment variables**: Run `go env` to check your Go environment variables. Make sure that the `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` variables are correctly set.

4. **Check your GitHub credentials**: Make sure that your GitHub credentials are correctly set on computer B. You can do this by running `git config --global --list` and checking the `user.name` and `user.email` fields.

5. **Check the module version**: Make sure that the specified version of the module actually exists. You can do this by visiting the module's repository and checking its releases.

6. **Try to download the module manually**: You can try to download the module manually by running `go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5`. If this fails, the error message might give you more information about what's going wrong.

7. **Check the go.mod file**: Make sure that the go.mod file is correctly formatted and that it includes all the necessary dependencies.

8. **Clear the Go module cache**: You can clear the Go module cache by running `go clean -modcache`. This will force Go to download all the dependencies again.

If none of these steps help, you might want to consider asking for help on the Go community forums or on Stack Overflow.
