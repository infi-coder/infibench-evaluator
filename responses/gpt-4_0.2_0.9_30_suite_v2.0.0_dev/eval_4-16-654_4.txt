You can add your SSH key to Git Bash using the `ssh-add` command. However, before doing that, you need to start the ssh-agent in the background.

Here are the steps:

1. Start Git Bash.
2. Start the ssh-agent in the background:

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
```

3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace `id_rsa` in the command with the name of your private key file.

```bash
ssh-add D:/keys/id_rsa
```

Now, your SSH key is added to Git Bash and you should be able to clone your repository.

Note: If your key is in the Putty's `.ppk` format, you need to convert it to the OpenSSH format (`id_rsa`) that Git Bash can use. You can do this using Puttygen: Load your `.ppk` file and then go to `Conversions > Export OpenSSH key`.
