You can use the factory pattern to create different instances of `ServiceBusClient` and `ServiceBusSender` for different queues. Here is an example:

1. Define an interface for the factory:
```c#
public interface IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    ServiceBusSender CreateSender(string queueName);
    ServiceBusReceiver CreateReceiver(string queueName);
}
```

2. Implement the factory:
```c#
public class ServiceBusClientFactory : IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    private readonly ServiceBusClient _serviceBusClient;

    public ServiceBusClientFactory(string connectionString)
    {
        _serviceBusClient = new ServiceBusClient(connectionString, new ServiceBusClientOptions
        {
            TransportType = ServiceBusTransportType.AmqpWebSockets
        });
    }

    public ServiceBusSender CreateSender(string queueName)
    {
        return _serviceBusClient.CreateSender(queueName);
    }

    public ServiceBusReceiver CreateReceiver(string queueName)
    {
        return _serviceBusClient.CreateReceiver(queueName, new ServiceBusReceiverOptions
        {
            ReceiveMode = ServiceBusReceiveMode.PeekLock
        });
    }
}
```

3. Register the factory in your DI container:
```c#
_services.TryAddSingleton<IServiceBusClientFactory>(implementationFactory =>
{
    var serviceBusConfiguration = implementationFactory.GetRequiredService<Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptions<UserEventConsumerSetting>>().Value;
    return new ServiceBusClientFactory(serviceBusConfiguration.ServiceBusConnectionString);
});
```

4. Use the factory to create `ServiceBusSender` and `ServiceBusReceiver` for different queues:
```c#
public class CarReservationMessagingService
{
    private readonly ServiceBusSender _serviceBusSender;

    public CarReservationMessagingService(IServiceBusClientFactory serviceBusClientFactory)
    {
        _serviceBusSender = serviceBusClientFactory.CreateSender("QueueName");
    }

    // ...
}
```

In this way, you can create `ServiceBusSender` and `ServiceBusReceiver` for different queues by calling `CreateSender` and `CreateReceiver` with different queue names.
