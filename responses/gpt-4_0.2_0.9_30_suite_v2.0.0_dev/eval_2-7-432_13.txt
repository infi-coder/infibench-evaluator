The "419 Page Expired" error is due to Laravel's CSRF protection. When you log out from one tab, the session is invalidated. So, when you try to log out from the other tab, Laravel can't find the session and throws a 419 error.

To handle this, you can customize the `logout` method in `App\Http\Controllers\Auth\LoginController`. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```php
public function logout(Request $request)
{
    $this->guard()->logout();

    $request->session()->invalidate();

    return $this->loggedOut($request) ?: redirect('/');
}
```

In this code, we're overriding the `logout` method from the `AuthenticatesUsers` trait. We're telling Laravel to log out the user, invalidate the session, and then redirect the user to the homepage.

This way, even if the user is already logged out (in another tab, for example), they will simply be redirected to the homepage without seeing the 419 error page.

Remember to include `use Illuminate\Http\Request;` at the top of your `LoginController` if it's not already there.

Also, note that this solution assumes that you want to redirect the user to the homepage after logging out. If you want to redirect to a different route, you can replace `'/'` with the route you prefer.
