The AWS CLI uses a pager program to handle its output by default. This can be changed by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. This will disable the pager.

You can do this in your bash script like this:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will disable the pager for the duration of the script. If you want to disable the pager permanently, you can add `export AWS_PAGER=""` to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file.

Alternatively, if you want to pipe the output to a file, you can do so like this:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > output.txt; 
done
```

This will redirect the output of the `aws` command to a file named `output.txt`. If you want to append to the file instead of overwriting it each time, you can use `>>` instead of `>`:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo >> output.txt; 
done
```
