The `navigator.geolocation` object is available in the user's browser, but it doesn't mean that the user has granted permission to access their location. The `getCurrentPosition` method is asynchronous and it takes two callbacks as arguments: the first one is executed when the location is successfully retrieved, and the second one is executed when an error occurs.

Here is how you can modify your code to handle both cases:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the user denies access to their location, the error callback will be executed and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console. If the geolocation is not supported by the browser, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged to the console.
