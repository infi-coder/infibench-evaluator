The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. That's why you can't install it using `composer require`.

You need to install it via your PHP installation. Here's how you can do it:

**For Ubuntu:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

**For CentOS:**

```bash
sudo yum install php-zip
```

**For MacOS (using brew):**

```bash
brew install php@7.3-zip
```

**For Windows:**

1. Open your `php.ini` file.
2. Search for `extension=php_zip.dll`.
3. Uncomment this line (remove the `;` at the start of the line).
4. Save and close the `php.ini` file.
5. Restart your web server.

After installing the extension, you can add it to your `composer.json` file like this:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1",
    "ext-zip": "*"
}
```

This won't install the extension, but it will warn anyone who tries to install your project without having the `ext-zip` extension enabled.

Then run `composer update` to update your `composer.json` file.

If you still encounter the problem, it might be because the extension is not enabled. You can check this by running `php -m` in your terminal to see the list of all enabled PHP modules. If `zip` is not in the list, you need to enable it. The process to do this varies depending on your operating system and your PHP installation.
