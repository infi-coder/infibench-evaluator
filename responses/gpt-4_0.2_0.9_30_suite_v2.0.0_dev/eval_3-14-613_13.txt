This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being linked to the correct target. Here's how you can check and fix it:

1. Open your SwiftUI file.
2. Click on the file name at the top of the Xcode editor.
3. In the file inspector on the right, under "Target Membership", make sure your app's target is checked.

If the target is already checked, try the following steps:

1. Clean your build folder (Product -> Clean Build Folder).
2. Restart Xcode.
3. Build your project again.

If the issue persists, try creating a new SwiftUI file and see if the preview works there. If it does, you can move your code to the new file.
