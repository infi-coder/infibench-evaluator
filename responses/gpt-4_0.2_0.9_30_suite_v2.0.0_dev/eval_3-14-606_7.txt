The alert you're seeing is likely due to the fact that the app you're trying to open is a developer or test version of an app, which requires your device to be in developer mode. However, iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" like Android does. Instead, you need to use Xcode on a Mac to access developer tools and features for iOS devices.

Here are the steps to use Xcode to access developer features:

1. Download and install Xcode from the Mac App Store. It's free to download.

2. Open Xcode and go to the "Window" dropdown menu, then select "Devices and Simulators".

3. Connect your iOS device to your Mac using a USB cable. Your device should appear in the left sidebar of the "Devices and Simulators" window.

4. Click on your device in the sidebar, then check the "Show as run destination" box.

5. You may need to trust your device. If prompted, follow the on-screen instructions to trust your device.

6. Once your device is trusted, you can use Xcode's developer tools to install the developer or test app on your device.

Remember, you need to have a valid Apple Developer account to use many of Xcode's features, including installing developer or test apps on a device. If you don't have an Apple Developer account, you can create one on the Apple Developer website.

If you're still having trouble opening the app after following these steps, it's possible that the app was built with a provisioning profile that doesn't match the one on your device. In this case, you'll need to get a new build of the app from the developer that matches your device's provisioning profile.
