Sure, you can use async/await with toPromise() to wait for the response. Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
async getData() {
  this.newIds = await this.repository.getById(Ids).toPromise();
  console.log(this.newIds);
}

this.getData();
```

Please note that the function containing the await expression must be declared as async.
