It seems like you're trying to get the local path of a file that is stored on SharePoint/OneDrive. Unfortunately, Excel VBA doesn't provide a direct way to get the local path of a file stored on SharePoint/OneDrive. 

However, you can use the `Environ` function in VBA to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. Here is a simple example:

```vba
Sub GetOneDrivePath()
    Dim OneDrivePath As String
    OneDrivePath = Environ("OneDrive")
    MsgBox OneDrivePath
End Sub
```

This will return the path of the root OneDrive folder. If you have a specific subfolder structure that is consistent across users, you can append that to the `OneDrivePath` variable.

Please note that this method only works if the user has set up OneDrive to sync locally. If the file is only available online, you won't be able to access it using a local path.

As for searching for a specific folder within the OneDrive directory, you can use the `Dir` function in VBA. However, this could be slow if you have a large number of files and folders in OneDrive.

Lastly, the "Open File Location" button in Excel uses the local cache of OneDrive files. It doesn't provide the actual local path of the file. Unfortunately, there's no way to access this information using VBA.
