Your code seems correct, but there could be a few reasons why your `useQuery` is hanging at the loading state:

1. **Network Issues**: The most common reason for this issue is a network problem. Make sure your device/emulator is connected to the internet and can reach the GraphQL server.

2. **Server Issues**: The server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' might be down or not responding. Try to access this URL in your browser to see if it's up and running.

3. **CORS Issues**: If your server is not set up to accept requests from your client's origin, it will result in a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error. This usually happens when you're trying to access a server from a different domain. Check your server's CORS settings.

4. **Apollo Client Setup**: Make sure the Apollo Client is correctly set up. The `uri` in the `ApolloClient` should point to your GraphQL server.

5. **Query Issues**: There might be an issue with your GraphQL query. Try running the query in a GraphQL playground or similar tool to see if it returns the expected data.

6. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, there's a known issue where network requests can hang indefinitely. Try disabling it to see if that's the cause.

7. **React Native Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of React Native you're using. Try updating to the latest version.

If none of the above solutions work, you could try to debug the issue by adding an error link to your Apollo Client to log any GraphQL errors:

```javascript
import { onError } from "@apollo/client/link/error";

const errorLink = onError(({ graphQLErrors, networkError }) => {
  if (graphQLErrors)
    graphQLErrors.map(({ message, locations, path }) =>
      console.log(
        `[GraphQL error]: Message: ${message}, Location: ${locations}, Path: ${path}`
      )
    );

  if (networkError) console.log(`[Network error]: ${networkError}`);
});

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: errorLink,
  uri: 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

This will log any GraphQL or network errors to the console, which might give you more insight into
