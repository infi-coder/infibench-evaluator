The `[Keyless]` attribute is part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace, not `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`. 

You should make sure you have the correct using directive at the top of your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Also, ensure that you have installed the appropriate Entity Framework Core NuGet package. If you're using SQL Server, for example, you should have the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` package installed.

You can install it via NuGet package manager in Visual Studio or by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```shell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
```

Or via .NET CLI:

```shell
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
```

After these steps, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class.
