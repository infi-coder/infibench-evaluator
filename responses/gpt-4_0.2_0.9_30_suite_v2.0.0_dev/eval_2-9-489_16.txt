The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. This means that without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. This file is usually located in the `/etc/elasticsearch` or `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

If you're using Elasticsearch with Docker, you can pass these configurations as environment variables:

```bash
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" -e "xpack.security.enabled=true" -e "xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled=true" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.13.1
```

After enabling the security features, you'll need to set up passwords for the built-in users. You can do this by running the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` command:

```bash
./bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto
```

This command will generate random passwords for all built-in users, including `elastic`, `apm_system`, `kibana`, `logstash_system`, `beats_system`, and `remote_monitoring_user`.

Remember to update your application's configuration to use the new password for the `elastic` user.

Please note that enabling security will also enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) for the transport networking layer. You might need to configure TLS as well.

For more information, you can check the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html).
