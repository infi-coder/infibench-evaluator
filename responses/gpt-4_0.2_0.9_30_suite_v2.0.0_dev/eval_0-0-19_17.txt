The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` cannot be found in the npm registry. This is because the correct package name is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`.

You can install the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js by running:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

This should resolve your issue.
