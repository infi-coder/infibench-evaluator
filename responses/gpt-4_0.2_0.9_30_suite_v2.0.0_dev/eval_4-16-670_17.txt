Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a RSA private key. Here's how you can do it:

1. Convert OpenSSH private key to RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for the old passphrase, and then ask for a new passphrase (you can keep it the same). The `-p` option tells `ssh-keygen` to change the passphrase of a private key file, `-m PEM` tells it to use the older PEM format instead of the new OpenSSH format, and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file to convert.

2. Regarding your second question, you don't need to convert the public key. The public key file (`id_rsa.pub`) doesn't have a header like the private key because it's format is different and simpler. It's basically a line of text that you can add to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server. The server doesn't need to know whether the corresponding private key is in OpenSSH or PEM format, it just needs to match the public key.

Please note that this command will overwrite your existing private key file. If you want to keep the original key as well, you should make a backup before running this command.
