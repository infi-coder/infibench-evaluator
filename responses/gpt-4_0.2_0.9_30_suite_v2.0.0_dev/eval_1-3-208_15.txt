The problem with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, not if each character of the input string is in the `correct` string. You should iterate over each character in the input string and check if it is in the `correct` string.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)
```

In this function, `all(char in correct for char in text)` checks if all characters in the `text` string are in the `correct` string. The `all` function returns `True` if all elements in the passed iterable are true. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

You can use this function like this:

```python
text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

This will print "Success" if all characters in the input string are either a letter or a digit, and "Failure" otherwise.
