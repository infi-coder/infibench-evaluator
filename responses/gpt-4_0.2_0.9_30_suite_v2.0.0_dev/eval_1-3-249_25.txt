Here is a Python function that generates a 16 character code that includes the substring "NAA3U" and exactly 3 digits. The function uses the `random` module to generate random characters and digits.

```python
import random
import string

def generateRandomString():
    # Define the characters and digits
    chars = string.ascii_letters
    digits = string.digits

    # Generate a random string of 11 characters (16 - length of "NAA3U")
    random_chars = ''.join(random.choice(chars) for _ in range(8))  # 8 random letters
    random_digits = ''.join(random.choice(digits) for _ in range(3))  # 3 random digits

    # Combine the random characters, "NAA3U", and random digits
    code = random_chars + "NAA3U" + random_digits

    # Shuffle the characters in the code
    code = list(code)
    random.shuffle(code)
    code = ''.join(code)

    return code
```

This function first generates a random string of 11 characters (16 - length of "NAA3U") that includes 8 random letters and 3 random digits. Then, it combines these random characters with "NAA3U". Finally, it shuffles the characters in the code to ensure randomness.

Please note that the substring "NAA3U" may not always be contiguous in the final code due to the shuffling. If you want "NAA3U" to always be contiguous, you would need to insert it at a random position in the string of 11 random characters instead of shuffling all characters.
