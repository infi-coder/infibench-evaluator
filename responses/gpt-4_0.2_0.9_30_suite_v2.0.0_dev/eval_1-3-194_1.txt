You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write to an Excel file. Here is the function you requested:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = Workbook()

    # grab the active worksheet
    ws = wb.active

    # write rows to the active worksheet
    for row in new_list:
        ws.append(row)

    # save the file
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function will create a new Excel file named "data.xlsx" and write the data from `new_list` into it. Each sub-list in `new_list` will be written as a new row in the Excel file.

You can install the `openpyxl` library using pip:

```shell
pip install openpyxl
```

Please note that the `openpyxl` library only supports `.xlsx` files. If you need to work with `.xls` files, you can use the `xlwt` library instead.
