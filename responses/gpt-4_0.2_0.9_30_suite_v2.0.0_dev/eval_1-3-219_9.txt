There could be several reasons why you're unable to start a Jupyter notebook on VS Code. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Check your Python interpreter**: Make sure you've selected the correct Python interpreter for your Jupyter notebook. You can do this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom-left corner of the VS Code window and selecting the interpreter that matches your conda environment.

2. **Check your Jupyter server**: Try starting a Jupyter server manually from the command line to see if there are any issues. You can do this by activating your conda environment and running `jupyter notebook`.

3. **Check your Python extension settings**: Make sure your Python extension settings in VS Code are correct. You can access these settings by clicking on the gear icon in the lower left corner, selecting "Settings", and searching for "Python". Make sure the Python Path is set to the Python interpreter in your conda environment.

4. **Reinstall the Python extension**: If all else fails, you can try reinstalling the Python extension in VS Code. You can do this by clicking on the Extensions view icon on the Sidebar, searching for the Python extension, and clicking on the uninstall button.

5. **Check your ipykernel version**: Sometimes, the issue can be caused by an incompatible version of ipykernel. You can check the version by running `pip show ipykernel` in your conda environment. If it's not the latest version, you can update it by running `pip install --upgrade ipykernel`.

6. **Check your VS Code version**: Make sure you're running the latest version of VS Code. You can check for updates by clicking on the gear icon in the lower left corner and selecting "Check for Updates".

If none of these steps solve your issue, it would be helpful to have more information about your setup. For example, the exact versions of VS Code, the Python extension, and Jupyter that you're using, as well as any error messages you're seeing in the VS Code output or terminal windows.
