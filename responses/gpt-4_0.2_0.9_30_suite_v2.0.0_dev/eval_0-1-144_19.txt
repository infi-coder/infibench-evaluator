You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This pseudo-element is responsible for the arrow. Here is how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may need to override the color property */
    color: green !important;
}
```

This will change the color of the accordion arrow to green. The `!important` rule is used to override any other conflicting styles that might be affecting the accordion arrow. However, it's generally recommended to avoid using `!important` if possible, as it can make debugging more difficult in the future.

If the above solution doesn't work, it means that the arrow might be an image or an SVG, in which case you would need to replace it with a green version.
