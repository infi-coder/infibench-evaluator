Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17 that you can use, it's called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. You can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can adapt your code snippet as follows:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

This should allow you to use Enzyme with React 17.0.1. Please note that this is an unofficial adapter, so it might not support all features or have the same level of support as the official ones.
