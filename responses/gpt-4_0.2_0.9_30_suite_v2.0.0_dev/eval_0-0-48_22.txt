Sure, the problem with your code is that TypeScript doesn't allow you to use multiple index signatures in a single type. You can solve this by creating two separate types and then merging them using intersection (`&`):

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type where each fruit is associated with a number and each color is associated with a boolean.
