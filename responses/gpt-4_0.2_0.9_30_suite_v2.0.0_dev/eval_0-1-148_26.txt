Sure, you can use the `last:` variant provided by Tailwind CSS to target the last element in a list. Here is how you can modify your code:

```html
  <ul>
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      :class="{ 'border-b border-black': index !== items.length - 1 }"
      class="border-solid"
    >
      Item
    </li>
  </ul>
```

In this code, the `border-b border-black` classes are only applied if the current item is not the last one in the list. This is determined by the condition `index !== items.length - 1`. If this condition is true, the classes are applied; if it's false (i.e., the item is the last one in the list), the classes are not applied.
