You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by using the `ssh-add` command. However, before you do that, you need to start the ssh-agent in the background.

Here are the steps:

1. Start Git Bash.
2. Start the ssh-agent in the background:

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
```

3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace `id_rsa` in the command with the name of your private key file.

```bash
ssh-add D:/keys_folder/id_rsa
```

Replace `id_rsa` with the name of your private key.

Now, your SSH key is added to Git Bash and you can use it to clone a repository from remote.

Please note that if your key was generated with PuttyGen, it might be in a format that `ssh-add` doesn't understand. You might need to convert it to the OpenSSH format using PuttyGen before you can add it to the ssh-agent.
