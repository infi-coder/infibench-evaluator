Yes, the comment is mostly correct. In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is not a regular function that you can call whenever you want. Its main purpose is to initialize the newly created object.

However, it's important to note that in some languages like JavaScript, you can call a constructor like a regular function, but it's not the common or intended use. In languages like Java or C++, trying to call a constructor like a regular function would result in a compile-time error. 

So, while the comment is generally true, there might be some exceptions depending on the programming language in question.
