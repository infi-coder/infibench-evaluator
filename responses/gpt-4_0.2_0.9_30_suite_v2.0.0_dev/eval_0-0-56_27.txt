The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vite's development server is only accessible from localhost by default. However, when running inside a Docker container, you need to make it accessible from any IP address, not just localhost.

To do this, you need to set the `host` option in the Vite server configuration to `0.0.0.0`. This will make the server accessible from any IP address.

Here's how you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server from outside the Docker container.
