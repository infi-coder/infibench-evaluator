In Rust, `Box<T>` is a smart pointer that points to data on the heap. It cannot be null. If you want to have an optional `Box`, you should use `Option<Box<T>>`, which can be `Some(box)` or `None`.

Here's how you can modify your code to use `Option<Box<Node>>`:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

Then, you can check if the `Box<Node>` is `None` (which is similar to null in other languages) like this:

```rust
if let Some(node) = &stack.top {
    // stack.top is not null
} else {
    // stack.top is null
}
```

Or using `match`:

```rust
match &stack.top {
    Some(node) => {
        // stack.top is not null
    },
    None => {
        // stack.top is null
    }
}
```

Or using `is_none()` or `is_some()` methods:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    // stack.top is null
}

if stack.top.is_some() {
    // stack.top is not null
}
```

Remember that in Rust, you don't have to manually check for null pointers as you do in languages like C or C++. The `Option` type is used to represent optional values and the compiler ensures that you handle the `None` case.
