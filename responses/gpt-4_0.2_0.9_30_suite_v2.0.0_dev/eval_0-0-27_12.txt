The code you've provided seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you can check if the data loading hangs:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure that your device or emulator has a proper internet connection. Sometimes, network issues can cause the loading to hang.

2. **Server Status**: Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can simply paste the URL into a web browser and see if it returns a response.

3. **GraphQL Query**: Test your GraphQL query in a GraphQL playground to ensure it's correct and the server is able to return the expected data.

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (e.g., "@apollo/client": "3.3.21") to see if it resolves the issue.

5. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, make sure to enable network inspect. This will allow you to see the requests and responses from the server.

6. **Error Handling**: Enhance your error handling to log the error message. This can provide more insight into what's going wrong. You can do this by logging `error.message`:

    ```javascript
    if (error) {
        console.log(error.message);
        return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
    }
    ```

7. **React Native Version**: You're using a version of React Native ("0.68.1") that doesn't exist. The latest version at the time of writing is "0.67.3". Please ensure you're using a valid version.

If none of these suggestions work, please provide more context or any error messages you're seeing, and I'd be happy to help further.
