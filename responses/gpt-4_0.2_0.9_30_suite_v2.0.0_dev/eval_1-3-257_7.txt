Here is a Python function that divides an even number into N parts, each part being a multiple of 2:

```python
def divideNumber(num, n):
    quotient, remainder = divmod(num, n)
    # Ensure quotient is even
    if quotient % 2 != 0:
        quotient -= 1
        remainder += n
    # Create initial list of even quotients
    result = [quotient] * n
    # Distribute remainder
    for i in range(0, remainder, 2):
        result[i // 2] += 2
    return result
```

This function first divides `num` by `n` to get the quotient and the remainder. If the quotient is not even, it decreases the quotient by 1 and increases the remainder by `n`. Then it creates a list of `n` elements, each of which is the (even) quotient. Finally, it distributes the remainder among the elements of the list by adding 2 to each element in turn.

Here is how you can use this function to divide 100 into 3 parts:

```python
print(divideNumber(100, 3))  # Output: [34, 34, 32]
```

This function assumes that `num` is even and `n` is greater than 0. If `num` is not even or `n` is not greater than 0, the function may not work correctly.
