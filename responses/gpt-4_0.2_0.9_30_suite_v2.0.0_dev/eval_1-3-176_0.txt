The error message indicates that the Pillow library could not be installed because the zlib library, which is a required dependency, could not be found. 

However, the main issue here is that you're trying to install an old version of Pillow (6.0.0) which doesn't support Python 3.8. 

You should try installing the latest version of Pillow, which supports Python 3.8. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pillow
```

This command will upgrade Pillow to the latest version. If you still encounter issues, it may be due to a problem with your Python environment or pip installation. In that case, you might want to consider re-installing Python or using a virtual environment.
