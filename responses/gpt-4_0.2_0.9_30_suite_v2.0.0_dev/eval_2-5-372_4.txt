The problem you're facing is due to the version of Hibernate Validator. The `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations are part of Hibernate Validator 6.x, but your logs show that you're using Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2. 

The version of Hibernate Validator is managed by Spring Boot, and it seems that the version of Spring Boot you're using (2.0.4.RELEASE) is compatible with Hibernate Validator 5.x. 

To solve this issue, you have two options:

1. **Upgrade your Spring Boot version to a version that supports Hibernate Validator 6.x.** Spring Boot 2.3.0 and later versions are compatible with Hibernate Validator 6.x. You can do this by changing the version in your `pom.xml`:

    ```xml
    <parent>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
        <version>2.3.0.RELEASE</version>
        <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->
    </parent>
    ```

2. **Use the validation annotations that are supported by Hibernate Validator 5.x.** Instead of `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank`, you can use `@NotNull` and `@Size(min=1)` to achieve similar validation:

    ```java
    @NotNull
    @Size(min=1)
    private String username;
    ```

Remember to run `mvn clean install` to ensure that your changes are picked up.
