The error you're seeing is due to the fact that you're trying to use Flutter's engine bindings before they're initialized. This is because you're trying to use `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` in the `main()` function, which is run before Flutter's engine is fully ready.

To fix this, you should use `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` before calling `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`. This will ensure that Flutter's engine is ready before you try to use it.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

`WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` is a method that initializes the binding for the first time. This is required if you need to use any plugins in the `main()` function.
