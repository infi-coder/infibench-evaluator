You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. Here's how you can do it:

First, you need to set a reference to "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library". To do this:

1. In the VBA editor, go to `Tools > References`.
2. In the "References" dialog box, scroll down to "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library" and check it.
3. Click "OK".

Then, you can use this code to copy text to the clipboard:

```vba
Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject

DataObj.SetText Me.NodeKey.Value
DataObj.PutInClipboard
```

This will copy the value of `Me.NodeKey.Value` to the clipboard. You can then paste it elsewhere.
