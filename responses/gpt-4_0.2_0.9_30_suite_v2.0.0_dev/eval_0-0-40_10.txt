The error message you're seeing suggests that there is a conflict between the Node.js and npm installations on your WSL2 Ubuntu and the installations on your Windows system. The `whereis` command shows that there are two versions of both `node` and `npm` available: one in `/usr/bin/` (the Ubuntu version) and one in `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/` (the Windows version).

To resolve this issue, you should adjust your `PATH` environment variable to prioritize the Ubuntu versions of `node` and `npm`. You can do this by adding the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
```

This line will add `/usr/bin` to the beginning of your `PATH`, which means that the system will look there first when trying to find `node` and `npm`.

After adding this line, you should source your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
# or
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Then, you should be able to run `npm -v` without any issues. If you still encounter problems, you might need to reinstall `npm` using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove npm
sudo apt-get install npm
```
