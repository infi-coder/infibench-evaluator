Sure, here is the revised code:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    result = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:] + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
        result.append(endString)
    return ' '.join(result)
```

In your original code, you were returning the result inside the loop, which is why you were only getting the first word transformed. You need to store the results in a list and join them into a string after the loop. Also, there's no need to convert the first character to uppercase and the rest to lowercase, as pig Latin doesn't change the case of the letters.
