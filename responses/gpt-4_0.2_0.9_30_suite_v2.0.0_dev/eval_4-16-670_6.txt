Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a RSA private key. You can use the `ssh-keygen` tool for this. Here are the steps:

1. Convert OpenSSH private key to RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for the passphrase (if any). After entering the passphrase, the key will be re-written in place in the RSA format. The `-p` option tells `ssh-keygen` to change the passphrase of a private key file, `-m PEM` tells it to use the older PEM format instead of the new OpenSSH format, and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file to convert.

2. Regarding your second question, you don't need to convert the public key. The public key format is standard and doesn't have the OpenSSH or RSA distinction. The public key can be derived from the private key. If you want to regenerate your public key from the private key, you can use the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

This command will overwrite your existing id_rsa.pub file with the public key derived from the RSA private key. The `-y` option tells `ssh-keygen` to read a private key file and print an associated public key, and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the private key file to read.
