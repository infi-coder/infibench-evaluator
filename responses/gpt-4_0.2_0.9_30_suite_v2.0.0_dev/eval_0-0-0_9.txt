Sure, here is a function that does exactly what you asked for:

```javascript
function keys_and_prices(raw_obj) {
    let keys = Object.keys(raw_obj);
    let prices = keys.map(key => raw_obj[key].price);
    return [keys, prices];
}
```

This function first gets all the keys from the object using `Object.keys()`. Then it maps over these keys and for each key, it gets the `price` field from the corresponding object. Finally, it returns an array containing the keys and prices arrays.

Please note that the order of keys and prices in the arrays depends on the order of properties in the original object. If the order matters, you might need to sort the keys array before mapping it to prices.
