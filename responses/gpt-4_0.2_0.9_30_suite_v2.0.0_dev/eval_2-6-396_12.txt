The error is because you're trying to create an index on a navigation property `Gender`. EF Core does not support this. You should create an index on the foreign key `GenderId` instead.

Here's the corrected code:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```
Now, when you run `dotnet ef add migration User`, it should work without any issues.
