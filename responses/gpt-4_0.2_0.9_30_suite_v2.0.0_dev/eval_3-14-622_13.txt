To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement a method that provides a `Shader` when given a `Rect` and a `ColorScheme`. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType, context: inout _ShapeStyle_Context) {
    }
}

struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}
```

In the above code, `RedShapeStyle` is a struct that conforms to `ShapeStyle` protocol. The `_apply(to:context:)` method is a requirement of the `ShapeStyle` protocol. 

Please note that the `ShapeStyle` protocol is not officially documented by Apple and its usage might change in future versions of SwiftUI.
