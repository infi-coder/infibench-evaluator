The error message is indicating that you are trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`), which is not allowed. 

Indexes in Entity Framework are used to speed up the performance of data retrieval operations on a database. They are only applicable to scalar properties (like `int`, `string`, `DateTime`, etc.) and cannot be used with navigation properties.

If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity, you should do it like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In the code above, `HasIndex(x => x.GenderId)` is used to create an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity.
