The code you've provided seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you could check if the loading state is hanging:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. Sometimes, network issues can cause the loading state to hang.

2. **Server Response**: Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is responding correctly. You can use tools like Postman or Apollo Studio to test the GraphQL query.

3. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (e.g., "@apollo/client": "3.3.21") and see if the issue persists.

4. **Error Handling**: Apollo's `useQuery` hook might not throw an error for network errors. Instead, it sets the `error` property of the result object. Try logging the error object to see if it contains any useful information.

5. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, try disabling it. There are known issues with it causing network requests to hang.

6. **React Native Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of React Native you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version and see if the issue persists.

If none of these suggestions work, it would be helpful to see any error messages you're getting in your console or network tab.
