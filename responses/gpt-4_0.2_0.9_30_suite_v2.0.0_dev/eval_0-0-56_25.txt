The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vite's server is binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) by default, which is not accessible from outside the Docker container. 

You can fix this by changing the `host` option in your `vite.config.ts` file to `0.0.0.0` which will make the server accessible from any network interface.

Here's how you can modify your `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server from outside the Docker container.
