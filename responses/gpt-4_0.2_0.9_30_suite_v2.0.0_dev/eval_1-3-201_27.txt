You can use Python's multiprocessing module to run these two tasks concurrently. Here's an example of how you can modify your code:

```python
import multiprocessing
from dash import Dash
import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc
import db
import hp
import fd

def run_dash():
    app = Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
    database=db.dataBase()
    homepage=hp.homepage(database)
    homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
    homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()
    app.run_server(debug=True)

def run_data_mining():
    database=db.dataBase()
    dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create processes
    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=run_dash)
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=run_data_mining)

    # Start processes
    p1.start()
    p2.start()

    # Join processes
    p1.join()
    p2.join()
```

In this code, `run_dash` and `run_data_mining` are two separate functions that are run in different processes. The `multiprocessing.Process` class is used to create a new process for each function. The `start` method starts the process, and the `join` method tells the main program to wait until these processes finish.

Please note that you need to ensure that your `fd.financeData` function and Dash app are designed to handle concurrent operations correctly, especially when they are reading from and writing to the same database.
