In Font Awesome 5, the way to use icons in CSS has changed a bit. You need to use the `::before` or `::after` pseudo-elements and set the `font-family` to `"Font Awesome 5 Free"` for solid icons, `"Font Awesome 5 Brands"` for brand icons, or `"Font Awesome 5 Regular"` for regular icons. 

Also, the `font-weight` property should be set to `900` for solid icons and `400` for regular or brand icons.

Here is how you can modify your code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* for solid icons */
  font-weight: 900; /* for solid icons */
}
```

Please note that the unicode `\f107` corresponds to the `fa-angle-down` icon in Font Awesome 4. In Font Awesome 5, the same icon has the same unicode, so you don't need to change it. 

If you want to use other types of icons (brands or regular), you should change the `font-family` and `font-weight` accordingly.
