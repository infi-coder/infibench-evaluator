The error message indicates that the `protoc-gen-go` tool is unable to determine the Go import path for your `simple.proto` file. This can be resolved by specifying a `go_package` option in your `.proto` source file.

Here's how you can modify your `simple.proto` file:

```protobuf
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "github.com/yourusername/yourrepository";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

In the `go_package` option, replace `"github.com/yourusername/yourrepository"` with the actual path where your Go code lives. This path is typically the repository where your Go code is hosted.

After making this change, you should be able to generate Go code from your `.proto` file using the `protoc --go_out=.` command.
