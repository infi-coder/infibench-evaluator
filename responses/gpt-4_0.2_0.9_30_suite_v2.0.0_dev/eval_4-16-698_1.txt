You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command reads and executes the `.bash_profile` file in the current shell. The `~` is a shortcut for your user home directory.

If you've made changes to other shell configuration files (like `.bashrc` or `.bash_aliases`), you can use the `source` command in the same way:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bash_aliases
```

This will apply any new aliases, functions, or configurations you've added.
