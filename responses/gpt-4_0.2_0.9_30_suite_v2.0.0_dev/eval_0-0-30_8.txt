Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17 called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. You can use it until the official adapter for React 17 is released.

Here is how you can adapt your code:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Before using this, you need to install the adapter. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

or if you are using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Please note that this is an unofficial package, so use it at your own risk. It is generally recommended to wait for the official package to be released.
