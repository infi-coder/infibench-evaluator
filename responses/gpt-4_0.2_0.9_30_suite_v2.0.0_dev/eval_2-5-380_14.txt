The issue might be due to the URL you are trying to access. The Swagger UI path has changed in newer versions of the Springdoc OpenAPI UI library.

Instead of using `localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`, you should use `localhost:8080/swagger-ui/`.

Also, make sure that you have the following dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
    <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-ui</artifactId>
    <version>1.6.11</version>
</dependency>
```

And, if you are using Spring Security, you need to permit all access to the Swagger UI path:

```java
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/swagger-ui/**").permitAll()
            .anyRequest().authenticated();
    }
}
```

If you want to customize the Swagger UI path, you can do so by adding the following property to your `application.properties` file:

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/your-custom-path
```

Then, you can access the Swagger UI at `localhost:8080/your-custom-path/`.
