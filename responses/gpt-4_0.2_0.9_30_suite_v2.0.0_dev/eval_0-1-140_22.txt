Font Awesome 5 has a few changes in how it's used compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is no longer just "FontAwesome", it's now separated into different styles: "Font Awesome 5 Free", "Font Awesome 5 Brands", and "Font Awesome 5 Pro". The `font-weight` for the free version is either 400 or 900.

The unicode for the down arrow (which was `f107` in Font Awesome 4) is still the same in Font Awesome 5. So, you should be able to use the following CSS:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

This will use the solid style icon. If you want to use the regular style icon, change the `font-weight` to 400.

Also, make sure you have included the correct Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project.
