The error message you're seeing is from ESLint, which is trying to read your `tsconfig.json` file but can't find it. This is because the `project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file is set to `"tsconfig.json"`, which means ESLint is looking for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file.

If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, you'll need to provide the correct relative path to it. For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would need to set `project` to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

Here's how you can modify your `.eslintrc.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "./tsconfig.json", // or the correct relative path to your tsconfig.json file
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  // ...
};
```

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file and you're still getting this error, there might be an issue with your ESLint or TypeScript installation. Try reinstalling them:

```bash
npm uninstall -g eslint @typescript-eslint/parser
npm install -g eslint @typescript-eslint/parser
```

If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your project structure and where your `tsconfig.json` and `.eslintrc.js` files are located.
