The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling zip archives. It's not a Composer package, so you can't install it using `composer require`.

If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can install it via the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

Or if you're using PHP 7.2, for example:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php7.2-zip
```

If you're using Windows, you can enable the extension in your `php.ini` file. Find the line `;extension=php_zip.dll` and uncomment it (remove the semicolon).

After you've installed or enabled the extension, you should add it to your `composer.json` file to indicate that your project depends on it. Here's how you can do it:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.2",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer update` to update your project dependencies.

If you're using Docker, you should add a command to install the zip extension in your Dockerfile. Here's an example:

```Dockerfile
RUN docker-php-ext-install zip
```

Remember to restart your web server after installing or enabling the PHP extension.
