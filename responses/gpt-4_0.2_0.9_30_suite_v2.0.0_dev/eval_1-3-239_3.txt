Sure, here is a bash script for installing Python 3.6.5 using Homebrew on macOS:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink current python
brew unlink python

# Install python 3.6.5
brew install python@3.6

# Link python 3.6.5
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will unlink your current Python installation before installing Python 3.6.5. After the installation, it will force link Python 3.6.5. 

You can save this script to a file, make it executable with `chmod +x filename`, and then run it with `./filename`. 

Also, please note that you need to have Homebrew installed on your macOS. If you don't have it, you can install it by running `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` in your terminal.
