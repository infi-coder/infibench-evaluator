You can optimize your task by using `awk` which is much faster for text processing tasks. Here is an example:

```bash
awk -F= '
    /^name=/ {name=$2}
    /^value=/ {if (name) print name"="$2; name=""}
' input.txt > output.txt
```

This script works as follows:

- `-F=` sets the field separator to `=`.
- `/^name=/ {name=$2}` stores the value of a `name` line in the `name` variable.
- `/^value=/ {if (name) print name"="$2; name=""}` checks if `name` is not empty, then prints `name=value` and clears `name`.

This script is much faster because it reads the file line by line and doesn't spawn any additional processes.
