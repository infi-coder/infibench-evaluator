You can add your SSH key to Git Bash using the `ssh-add` command. However, before you do that, you need to start the ssh-agent in the background.

Here are the steps:

1. Start Git Bash.
2. Start the ssh-agent in the background:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```bash
ssh-add 'D:/keys folder/your-private-key'
```

Replace `'D:/keys folder/your-private-key'` with the path to your private key file.

If you generated your key with PuttyGen, it might be in a `.ppk` format which is not accepted by `ssh-add`. You would need to convert it to OpenSSH format using PuttyGen:

1. Open PuttyGen
2. Click Load
3. Load your private key
4. Go to Conversions -> Export OpenSSH and export your private key
5. Copy your private key to `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (or another name but remember to use it in `ssh-add` command)
6. `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
7. Then add it using `ssh-add` command as described above.
