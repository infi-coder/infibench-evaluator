Sure, you can achieve this using the `groupby` function in pandas along with `cumsum` function. Here is the function you requested:

```python
def aggregation(df):
    # Ensure 'value' column is numeric
    df['value'] = pd.to_numeric(df['value'])

    # Create a new column 'balance' which is the cumulative sum of 'value' where 'type' is 'deposit'
    df['balance'] = df[df['type'] == 'deposit'].groupby('exchange')['value'].cumsum()

    # Forward fill the 'balance' column
    df['balance'] = df['balance'].ffill()

    return df
```

This function first ensures that the 'value' column is numeric. Then it creates a new column 'balance' which is the cumulative sum of 'value' where 'type' is 'deposit', grouped by 'exchange'. Finally, it forward fills the 'balance' column to fill the NaN values.

Please note that this function assumes that the DataFrame is sorted by 'exchange'. If it's not, you might want to sort it first.
