Here is a Python function that uses the `re` module to replace dashes and underscores with spaces, then uses the `title` method to capitalize the first letter of each word, and finally removes the spaces:

```python
import re

def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ''
    else:
        words = re.split('-|_', text)
        return words[0] + ''.join(word.title() for word in words[1:])
```

This function works by first checking if the input string is empty. If it is, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it splits the input string into a list of words, using either a dash or an underscore as the delimiter. It then returns a new string that consists of the first word in the list, followed by the rest of the words with their first letter capitalized. The `title` method is used to capitalize the first letter of each word.
