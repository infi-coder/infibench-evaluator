The issue you're facing might be due to the change in the default URL for Swagger UI. In the newer versions of springdoc-openapi-ui, the Swagger UI is not available at `/swagger-ui.html` anymore. 

Instead, you should be able to access it at `/swagger-ui/index.html` or simply `/swagger-ui/`.

So, try accessing the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/` or `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.

If you still face issues, ensure that the Spring Boot application is running and that the springdoc-openapi-ui dependency is correctly added to your project.
