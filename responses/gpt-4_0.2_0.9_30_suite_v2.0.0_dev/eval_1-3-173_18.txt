Sure, you can use the `calendar` module in Python to check if a year is a leap year or not. Here is a function that does this:

```python
import calendar

def DaysInYear(year):
    if calendar.isleap(year):
        return 366
    else:
        return 365
```

You can use this function by passing the year as an argument. For example, `DaysInYear(2020)` will return `366` and `DaysInYear(2019)` will return `365`.

If you want to extract the year from a datetime in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, you can use the `datetime` module in Python. Here is an example:

```python
from datetime import datetime

date_string = "2020-03-30"
date_object = datetime.strptime(date_string, "%Y-%m-%d")
year = date_object.year

print(DaysInYear(year))  # Outputs: 366
```

In this example, the `strptime` function is used to convert the date string into a datetime object. The year is then extracted from this object using the `year` attribute. The `DaysInYear` function is then called with this year as an argument.
