The error message you're seeing indicates that the zlib library, which is a required dependency for Pillow, is not found on your system. 

However, the main issue here seems to be that you're trying to install an older version of Pillow (6.0.0) which does not support Python 3.8. 

You should try installing the latest version of Pillow which supports Python 3.8. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install pillow --upgrade
```

If you still encounter the same error, it means zlib is not installed on your system. You can download zlib from [zlib.net](http://www.zlib.net/). After downloading, you can install it by following the instructions provided in the README file.

If you're still having trouble, you might want to consider using a Python version that is compatible with the Pillow version you're trying to install. You can use a Python version manager like pyenv to easily switch between Python versions.
