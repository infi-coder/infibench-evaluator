Your code seems fine. However, there are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Network Connection:** Ensure your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. Sometimes, the device/emulator might not be connected to the internet, causing the request to hang.

2. **Server Status:** Check if the server at `https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io` is up and running. You can do this by visiting the URL in a web browser.

3. **GraphQL Query:** Test your GraphQL query in a GraphQL playground to ensure it's correct and the server responds as expected. The URL `https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io` should provide a GraphQL playground.

4. **Apollo Client Version:** There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (e.g., `@apollo/client@3.3.6`) to see if the issue persists.

5. **React Native Debugger:** If you're using a debugger like React Native Debugger, try disabling it. Sometimes, the debugger can interfere with network requests.

6. **Error Handling:** Update your error handling to log the error message. This can provide more insight into what's going wrong:

    ```javascript
    if (error) {
        console.log(error.message);
        return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
    }
    ```

7. **Apollo Client Setup:** Ensure your Apollo Client setup is correct. The `uri` should point to your GraphQL server, and the `cache` should be an instance of `InMemoryCache`.

If none of these suggestions work, please provide more information about your setup or any error messages you're seeing.
