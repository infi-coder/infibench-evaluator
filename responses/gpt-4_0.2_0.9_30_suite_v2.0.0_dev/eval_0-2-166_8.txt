Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would do in traditional CSS with the `>` operator. 

Tailwind CSS works by adding utility classes to HTML elements. Therefore, you would need to add the necessary classes directly to the child `div` elements you want to style.

For example, if you want to apply a background color to the direct children `div` of a parent `div` with class "section", you would do something like this:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-red-500">...</div>
  <div class="bg-red-500">...</div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-red-500` is a Tailwind CSS utility class for applying a red background color.

If you need to apply styles to child elements based on their parent, you might need to use JavaScript or a preprocessor like Sass or Less in combination with Tailwind CSS.
