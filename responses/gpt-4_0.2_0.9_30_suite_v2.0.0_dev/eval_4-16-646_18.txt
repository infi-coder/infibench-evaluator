The error message `bad CPU type in executable` usually means that the binary you're trying to run is not compatible with the architecture of your CPU. This is a common issue on MacOS Catalina because it dropped support for 32-bit applications.

`pdftk` is one of the applications that has not been updated to 64-bit and therefore it does not work on MacOS Catalina or later versions.

Here are some alternatives to `pdftk` that you can use:

1. **PDFtk Server**: This is a command-line tool that is a part of the PDFtk toolkit. It is a simple tool that allows you to merge PDF documents, split PDF pages into new documents, rotate PDF pages, decrypt and encrypt, update metadata, apply watermarks, and much more.

    To install PDFtk Server, you can use Homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install pdftk-java
    ```

    After installing, you can use `pdftk-java` instead of `pdftk`.

2. **QPDF**: This is a command-line program that does structural, content-preserving transformations on PDF files. It could have been called something like pdf-to-pdf. It also provides many useful capabilities to developers of PDF-producing software or for people who just want to look at the innards of a PDF file to learn more about how they work.

    To install QPDF, you can use Homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install qpdf
    ```

3. **PDFsam**: PDF Split and Merge is a very simple, easy to use, free, open source utility to split and merge pdf files. It has a simple graphical interface to let the user choose pdf files, split or merge them.

    To install PDFsam, you can download it from the official website: https://pdfsam.org/downloads/

Remember to replace `pdftk` with the alternative you choose in your scripts or commands.
