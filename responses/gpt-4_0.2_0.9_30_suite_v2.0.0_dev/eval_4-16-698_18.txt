You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command reads and executes the `.bash_profile` in the current shell environment.

Alternatively, you can use the `.` command, which is equivalent to `source`:

```bash
. ~/.bash_profile
```

Both of these commands will apply the changes you made to your `.bash_profile` in your current terminal session.
