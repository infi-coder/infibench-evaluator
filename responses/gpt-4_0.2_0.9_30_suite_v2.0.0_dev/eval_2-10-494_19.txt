The error message "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args`" is coming from the Rust Analyzer, which is a language server protocol implementation for Rust. It's not an error from the Rust compiler itself.

This error message is indicating that Rust Analyzer is having trouble resolving the `format_args` macro. This is likely a bug or limitation in Rust Analyzer, not an issue with your code. If your code is compiling and running correctly, then it's likely that your code is fine.

As for how to fix this, there isn't a direct way to fix this because it's likely an issue with Rust Analyzer itself. However, you can try a few things:

1. **Update Rust Analyzer**: If you're using an older version of Rust Analyzer, updating to the latest version might fix the issue.

2. **Restart your editor**: Sometimes, simply restarting your editor can fix issues with Rust Analyzer.

3. **Check your Rust version**: Make sure you're using a recent stable version of Rust. Rust Analyzer might have issues with older versions of Rust.

4. **Disable and re-enable Rust Analyzer**: If all else fails, you can try disabling Rust Analyzer, restarting your editor, and then re-enabling Rust Analyzer.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider reporting the issue to the Rust Analyzer team. They might be able to provide a fix or workaround.
