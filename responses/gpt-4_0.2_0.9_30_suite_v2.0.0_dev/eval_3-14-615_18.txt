No, as of SwiftUI 2.0, there is no built-in way to get the current scroll position of a `ScrollView`. The `ScrollViewReader` and `ScrollViewProxy` only provide the `scrollTo` method, which allows you to programmatically set the scroll position, but there's no method to get the current position. 

You may have to resort to using `UIKit` components with `UIViewRepresentable` if you need this functionality.
