The issue is with the single quotes around `$searchT` in your `grep` command. Single quotes in bash will prevent variable expansion, meaning `$searchT` is treated as a literal string, not a variable. To fix this, you should use double quotes instead.

Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

Also, note that `grep "$searchT" && wc -l` will not give you the count of matches. It should be `grep "$searchT" | wc -l` to pipe the output of `grep` to `wc -l` which will then count the number of lines.
