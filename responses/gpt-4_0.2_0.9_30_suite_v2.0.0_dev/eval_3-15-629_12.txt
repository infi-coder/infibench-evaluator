You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. This object is part of the Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library. Here's a simple function that you can use to copy text to the clipboard:

```vba
Sub CopyTextToClipboard(sText As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText sText
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
    Set DataObj = Nothing
End Sub
```

You can call this function like this:

```vba
Call CopyTextToClipboard(Me.NodeKey.Value)
```

If you get an error about `MSForms.DataObject`, you might need to set a reference to Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library. You can do this by:

1. Go to the VBA editor (Alt + F11)
2. Go to Tools > References
3. Scroll down and check "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library"
4. Click OK

If you don't see "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library", you might need to browse for `FM20.dll`. This file is usually located in `C:\Windows\System32`.
