There is a bit of confusion here. iOS does not have a "Developer Mode" like Android. However, there are a few things that might be causing the issue you're experiencing:

1. **Provisioning Profile**: Make sure that the app is signed with a valid provisioning profile that includes the UDID of the device you're trying to install the app on.

2. **Trust Developer**: After installing a developer app for the first time, you must manually trust the developer on your iOS device. Here's how to do it:

    - Go to Settings > General > Profiles or Profiles & Device Management. You then see a profile for the developer under the "Developer App" section.
    - Tap the developer's profile under the Enterprise App heading to establish trust for this developer.
    - Then you see a prompt to confirm your choice. After you trust this profile, you can manually install other apps from the same developer and open them immediately. This developer remains trusted until you use the Delete App button to remove all apps from the developer.

3. **Developer Account**: If you're a developer and want to install apps on your device that aren't from the App Store, you'll need to have an Apple Developer account and use Xcode to install the apps on your device.

4. **TestFlight**: If you're trying to test an app, the developer can also send you an invitation to use TestFlight, which is a tool provided by Apple for beta testing apps.

If you're still having trouble, it might be best to contact the developer of the app or Apple Support for more specific help.
