Sure, the issue here is that you're trying to instantiate an object, not a class. You should return a function that returns an object in your mock. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  // Returns a function that returns an object
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

Now, when you call `new API()`, it will return the mocked object as expected.
