In Rust, `Box<T>` cannot be null. It is a non-null smart pointer. If you want to have an optional `Box<T>`, you should use `Option<Box<T>>`. When the `Option` is `None`, it means there is no `Box<T>` (similar to a null pointer in other languages).

Here is how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

In this case, `None` would represent an empty stack or the end of the stack. You can check if the `Box<Node>` is `None` (similar to null) like this:

```rust
if let Some(node) = &stack.top {
    // stack is not empty
} else {
    // stack is empty
}
```

Or you can use `is_none()` and `is_some()` methods:

```rust
if stack.top.is_some() {
    // stack is not empty
} else {
    // stack is empty
}
```
