It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that provides abbreviations and shortcuts for HTML/CSS, greatly improving your HTML & CSS workflow.

For example, in HTML, if you type `.classname`, Emmet will expand this into `<div class="classname"></div>` when you press `Tab`.

If this isn't working for you, it could be because:

1. You don't have Emmet installed or enabled in your text editor.
2. Your text editor doesn't support Emmet.
3. You're not pressing `Tab` after typing the abbreviation.

Here's how you can get it working:

1. **Check if your text editor supports Emmet**: Emmet is built-in in many text editors like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, etc. If you're using one of these, you should have Emmet out of the box.

2. **Check if Emmet is enabled**: If your text editor supports Emmet, make sure it's enabled. You can usually find this in your text editor's settings or preferences.

3. **Install Emmet**: If your text editor doesn't support Emmet, you might be able to install it as a plugin or extension. Check your text editor's documentation or plugin marketplace to see if this is possible.

4. **Use the correct syntax**: Make sure you're using the correct Emmet abbreviation syntax. For a div with a class, you should type `.classname` (replace `classname` with your desired class name), then press `Tab`.

5. **Check your file type**: Emmet usually only works in HTML/CSS files. Make sure your file is saved with the correct file extension (`.html` for HTML files, `.css` for CSS files) and that your text editor recognizes the file type.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about your setup (e.g., which text editor you're using) and we can provide more specific help.
