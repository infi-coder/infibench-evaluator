The error you're seeing is due to the fact that you're trying to use an asynchronous function (`getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`) at the top level of your application, which isn't allowed in Flutter. 

You should move the initialization of the `appDocsDir` variable inside the `runApp()` function or inside the `initState()` method of your `MyApp` widget.

Here's an example of how you can do it:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder(
      // Initialize Hive and get the appDocsDir
      future: _initHive(),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
          // Hive and appDocsDir have been initialized, return the main app
          return MaterialApp(
            title: 'Flutter Demo',
            theme: ThemeData(
              primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
            ),
            home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
          );
        } else {
          // Hive and appDocsDir are still being initialized, return a loading screen
          return CircularProgressIndicator();
        }
      },
    );
  }

  Future _initHive() async {
    final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  }
}
```

In this code, we're using a `FutureBuilder` to handle the initialization of Hive and getting the `appDocsDir`. The `FutureBuilder` will show a loading spinner until `_initHive()` has completed. Once it's done, it will build the main app.
