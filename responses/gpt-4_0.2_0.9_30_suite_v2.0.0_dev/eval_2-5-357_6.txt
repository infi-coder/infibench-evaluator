Yes, you're correct. Since Spring 4.3, if a class has only one constructor, the `@Autowired` annotation is no longer necessary. Spring will use that constructor automatically for dependency injection.

However, if there are multiple constructors, Spring won't know which one to use, so you'll need to add `@Autowired` to the constructor you want Spring to use for dependency injection.

People might still use `@Autowired` on constructors out of habit, for explicitness, or because they're working with a codebase that needs to be compatible with older versions of Spring.
