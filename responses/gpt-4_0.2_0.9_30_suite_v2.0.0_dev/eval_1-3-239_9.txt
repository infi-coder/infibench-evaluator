Sure, here is a simple bash script to install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current python version
brew unlink python

# Install the required python version
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed python version
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will unlink your current Python version before installing Python 3.6.5. If you have other Python versions installed and you want to keep them linked, you may need to adjust the script accordingly.
