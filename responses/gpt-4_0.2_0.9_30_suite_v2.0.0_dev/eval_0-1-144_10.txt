You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This pseudo-element is responsible for the arrow.

Here is the CSS code:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may want to include vendor prefixes for older browsers */
    color: green;
}
```

This will change the color of the arrow to green. However, please note that Bootstrap uses the `background-image` property to create the arrow, not the `color` property. So, if the above code doesn't work, you might need to override the `background-image` property with your own arrow image or SVG.

Also, remember to include this CSS after the Bootstrap CSS in your HTML file, or else the Bootstrap CSS might override your custom styles.
