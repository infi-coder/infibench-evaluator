The error message `bad CPU type in executable` means that the binary you're trying to run is not compatible with the architecture of your CPU. This is a common issue on MacOS Catalina because it dropped support for 32-bit applications.

The `pdftk` tool is not maintained anymore and it's not compatible with MacOS Catalina. However, there's a fork of `pdftk` called `pdftk-java` which is compatible with MacOS Catalina.

Here are the steps to install `pdftk-java`:

1. Uninstall the old `pdftk` if it's still installed:

    ```bash
    brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies pdftk
    ```

2. Install `pdftk-java`:

    ```bash
    brew install pdftk-java
    ```

3. Create a symbolic link to `pdftk-java` so you can still use the `pdftk` command:

    ```bash
    echo 'alias pdftk="/usr/local/bin/pdftk-java"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

4. Reload your shell configuration:

    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

Now you should be able to use `pdftk` as before.
