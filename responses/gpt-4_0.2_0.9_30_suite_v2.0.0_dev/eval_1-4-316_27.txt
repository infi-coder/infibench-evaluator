The error you're seeing is because the `sort` function in R doesn't work directly on lists. However, you can use the `unlist` function to convert the list to a vector, sort it, and then convert it back to a list if necessary.

Here's how you can define your `mySort` function:

```r
mySort <- function(l) {
  # Convert list to vector
  vec <- unlist(l)
  
  # Sort vector
  sorted_vec <- sort(vec)
  
  # Convert sorted vector back to list
  sorted_list <- as.list(sorted_vec)
  
  return(sorted_list)
}
```

You can use this function to sort your list as follows:

```r
sorted_list_text_data <- mySort(list_text_data)
```

This will return a list of the same letters, but sorted alphabetically.
