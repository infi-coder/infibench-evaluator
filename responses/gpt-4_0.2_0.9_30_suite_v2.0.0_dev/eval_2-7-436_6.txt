The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal. If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, and XML. You can check your installed extensions by running `php -m` in your terminal. If any of these extensions are missing, you need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Although you've mentioned that you've updated Composer to version 2.3.10, it's worth double-checking. Run `composer --version` in your terminal to confirm. If your Composer version is lower than 2.0, you need to upgrade it.

4. **Check your Laravel Installer version**: If you're using the Laravel Installer, make sure it's updated to the latest version. You can check the version by running `laravel --version` in your terminal. If it's not the latest version, you can update it by running `composer global require laravel/installer`.

5. **Clear Composer cache**: Sometimes, Composer cache might cause issues. You can clear the cache by running `composer clear-cache`.

After ensuring all these requirements are met, try running the `composer create-project` command again. If you're still facing issues, please provide more details about your environment (PHP version, installed PHP extensions, Composer version) for further assistance.
