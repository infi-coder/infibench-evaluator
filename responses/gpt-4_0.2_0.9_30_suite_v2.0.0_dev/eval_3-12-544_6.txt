The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to access platform-specific code before `runApp()` is called. This is not allowed in Flutter because the binding with the host platform is not fully initialized until `runApp()` is called.

To fix this, you should move your platform-specific code inside the `main()` function to a point after `runApp()` has been called. You can do this by running your code inside the `initState()` method of your root widget, or by using `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`.

Here's how you can do it:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

In this code, `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` is called before any platform-specific code. This method ensures that the widget binding has been fully initialized before you try to use platform channels (which is what `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` does under the hood).
