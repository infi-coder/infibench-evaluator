The error you're getting is because the `sort` function in R doesn't work directly on lists. However, you can use the `unlist` function to convert your list to a vector, sort it, and then convert it back to a list if needed.

Here's how you can define your `mySort` function:

```r
mySort <- function(l) {
  # Unlist the list to a vector
  unlisted_l <- unlist(l)
  
  # Sort the vector
  sorted_l <- sort(unlisted_l)
  
  # Convert back to list and return
  return(as.list(sorted_l))
}
```

You can then use this function to sort your list:

```r
sorted_list = mySort(list_text_data)
```

This will return a list of the same letters, but sorted in alphabetical order.
