You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. The `source` command reads and executes commands from the file specified as its argument in the current shell environment.

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute the `.bash_profile` file in your home directory. This means any changes you made to the file will be applied to your current terminal session.

If you're using zsh (which is the default shell in macOS Catalina and later), you should use:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

This command will read and execute the `.zshrc` file in your home directory.
