The error you're seeing is due to Laravel's built-in CSRF protection. When you log out in one tab, the session is invalidated. So when you try to log out in the other tab, Laravel can't find the session and throws a `419 Page Expired` error.

To handle this gracefully, you can catch the `TokenMismatchException` in your `Handler.php` file and redirect the user to the login page. Here's how you can do it:

```php
// app/Exceptions/Handler.php

use Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException;

public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof TokenMismatchException) {
        // Redirect to a form. Here is an example of how we can
        // redirect to the login page if the user is logged out
        // during the request.
        return redirect()->route('login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

This way, if a `TokenMismatchException` is thrown (which is what happens when a CSRF token is invalid or missing), the user will be redirected to the login page instead of seeing the `419 Page Expired` error.

Remember to import the `TokenMismatchException` at the top of your `Handler.php` file:

```php
use Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException;
```

Also, make sure that the route name in the `redirect()->route('login')` matches the name of your login route. You can check your route names using the `php artisan route:list` command.
