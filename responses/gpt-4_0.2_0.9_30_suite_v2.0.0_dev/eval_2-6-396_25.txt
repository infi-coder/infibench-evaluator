The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. Indexes can only be created on scalar properties, not navigation properties.

You should create an index on the `GenderId` property, not the `Gender` navigation property. Here's how you can do it:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId); // Create index on GenderId, not Gender
    });
}
```

This will create an index on the `GenderId` column in the `User` table, which should help speed up queries that filter or sort by `GenderId`.
