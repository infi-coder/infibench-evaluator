Here is a Python function that divides an even number into N parts, each part being a multiple of 2:

```python
def divideNumber(num, n):
    # Calculate the base value and remainder
    base, rem = divmod(num, n)
    # Ensure the base value is a multiple of 2
    if base % 2 != 0:
        base -= 1
        rem += n
    # Create the result list with base values
    result = [base] * n
    # Distribute the remainder
    for i in range(0, rem, 2):
        result[i // 2] += 2
    return result
```

This function first calculates the base value and the remainder. If the base value is not a multiple of 2, it decreases the base value by 1 and increases the remainder by `n`. Then it creates a list with `n` base values. Finally, it distributes the remainder by adding 2 to each group in succession.

Let's test this function with your example:

```python
print(divideNumber(100, 3))  # Output: [34, 34, 32]
```

This function works as expected and gives the correct output.
