The error you're seeing is due to Laravel's built-in CSRF protection. When you log out from one tab, the session is invalidated, and the CSRF token stored in the session is also invalidated. When you try to log out from the second tab, the server can't find a valid CSRF token, so it returns a 419 error.

One way to handle this is to catch the `TokenMismatchException` and handle it gracefully. You can do this in your `app/Exceptions/Handler.php` file:

```php
public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof \Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException) {
        // Redirect to a form. Here is an example of how we can
        // return a view or just redirect to a different endpoint or route.
        return redirect('/login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

This will redirect the user to the login page whenever a `TokenMismatchException` is thrown, which happens when a CSRF token is invalid or missing.

Please note that this is a global exception handler and will affect all forms that use CSRF protection in your application. If you want to handle this exception only for the logout action, you might need to implement a custom logout method in your `AuthController` and handle the exception there.
