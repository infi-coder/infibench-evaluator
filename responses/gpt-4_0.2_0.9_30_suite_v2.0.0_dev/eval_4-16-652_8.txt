AWS CLI version 2 introduced automatic paging for commands that return multiple pages of output. This can be disabled in a few ways:

1. **Per-command basis**: You can disable the pager for a single command by redirecting the output to `stdout`:

    ```bash
    aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > /dev/null
    ```

2. **Environment variable**: You can disable the pager for all commands in the current session by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string:

    ```bash
    export AWS_PAGER=""
    ```

3. **AWS CLI configuration**: You can disable the pager for all commands permanently by setting the `cli_pager` option in your AWS CLI configuration file to an empty string:

    ```bash
    aws configure set cli_pager ""
    ```

So, your script would look like this:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""

for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will disable the pager for all commands in the script.
