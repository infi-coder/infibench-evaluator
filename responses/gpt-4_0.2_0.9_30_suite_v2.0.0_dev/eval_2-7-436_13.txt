The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version:** Laravel 9 requires PHP version 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running the command `php -v` in your terminal. If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions:** Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, and XML. You can check your installed extensions by running `php -m` in your terminal. If any of these extensions are missing, you'll need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version:** Although you've mentioned that you've updated Composer to version 2.3.10, it's worth double-checking this. You can check your Composer version by running `composer --version` in your terminal.

4. **Clear Composer's cache:** Sometimes, Composer's cache can cause issues. You can clear it by running `composer clear-cache`.

5. **Try installing Laravel without specifying a version:** If none of the above steps work, you can try installing Laravel without specifying a version by running `composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog`. This will install the latest stable version of Laravel.

If you're still having issues after following these steps, please provide more information about your environment (PHP version, installed PHP extensions, Composer version) so I can help you further.
