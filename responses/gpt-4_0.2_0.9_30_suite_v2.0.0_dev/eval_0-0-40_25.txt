The problem you're encountering is due to a conflict between the Node.js and npm versions installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu and the versions installed in your Windows system. The `whereis` command shows that both the Ubuntu and Windows versions are accessible, which is causing the conflict.

To solve this, you need to remove the Windows path from the Ubuntu $PATH. You can do this by editing the `.bashrc` file in your home directory.

1. Open the `.bashrc` file in a text editor. You can use `nano`:

    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```

2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:

    ```bash
    # remove Windows paths
    export PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed -e 's/:\/mnt.*//g')
    ```

3. Save the file and exit the editor. If you're using `nano`, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y` to confirm the save, and finally `Enter` to confirm the file name.

4. Close the terminal and open a new one to apply the changes.

Now, when you run `npm -v`, it should show the version of npm installed in your Ubuntu system, not the one from Windows.

Remember that this change will prevent you from running any Windows executables from the Ubuntu terminal. If you need to do this, you might want to consider a different approach, such as installing Node.js and npm directly in Windows and accessing them from WSL2 via the `/mnt/c/` path.
