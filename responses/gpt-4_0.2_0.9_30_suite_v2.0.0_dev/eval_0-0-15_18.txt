Sure, here is the revised version of your code snippet:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this revised version, we are mocking the entire `API` class and its constructor. This way, when you call `new API()`, it will return the mocked implementation of the class.
