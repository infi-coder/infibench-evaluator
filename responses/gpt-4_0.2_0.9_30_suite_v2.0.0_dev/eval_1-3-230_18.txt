The `_io.BytesIO` object is a stream of bytes. To convert it to a bytes-like object, you can use the `getvalue()` method. This method returns the entire contents of the BytesIO object as a bytes object.

Here is how you can modify your function:

```python
def uncompress_body(self, compression_type, body):
    if isinstance(body, _io.BytesIO):
        body = body.getvalue()

    if compression_type == 'gzip' or compression_type == 'compress':
        return zlib.decompress(body)
    elif compression_type == 'deflate':
        compressor = zlib.compressobj(9, zlib.DEFLATED, -zlib.MAX_WBITS)
        compressed = compressor.compress(body)
        compressed += compressor.flush()
        return base64.b64encode(compressed)

    return body
```

This will ensure that if the body is a BytesIO object, it will be converted to a bytes object before attempting to decompress it.
