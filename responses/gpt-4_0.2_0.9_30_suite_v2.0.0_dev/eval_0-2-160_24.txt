The `sourceMap` option in the `tsconfig.json` file is used for debugging purposes. When it's set to `true`, the TypeScript compiler generates corresponding `.map` files for each `.js` file it outputs. These `.map` files are source maps, which are essentially files that map from the transformed source to the original source, enabling the browser to reconstruct the original source and present the reconstructed original in the debugger.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the TypeScript compiler will not generate these `.map` files. This means that if you try to debug your TypeScript code in the browser, you will see the compiled JavaScript code instead of your original TypeScript code. This can make debugging more difficult, as the JavaScript code may look quite different from your TypeScript code, especially if you're using advanced TypeScript features.

However, in a production environment, you might want to set `"sourceMap": false` to reduce the size of the deployed code, as the `.map` files can be quite large and are not needed for the application to run. They are only useful for debugging.

So, in summary, setting `"sourceMap": false` won't change anything in the behavior of your app, but it will affect your debugging experience.
