You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This is the element that Bootstrap uses to create the arrow. Here's how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is expanded */
    color: green;
}

.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is collapsed */
    color: green;
}
```

This CSS will change the color of the arrow to green both when the accordion is expanded and when it is collapsed. If you want different colors for each state, you can change the color in the respective rule.

Please note that this is a CSS solution and it should be included in a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` of your HTML or in an external CSS file.
