You can use the factory pattern to create multiple instances of `ServiceBusClient` with different queue names. Here's how you can do it:

First, create a factory interface:
```c#
public interface IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    ServiceBusSender CreateSender(string queueName);
    ServiceBusReceiver CreateReceiver(string queueName);
}
```

Then, implement the factory:
```c#
public class ServiceBusClientFactory : IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    private readonly ServiceBusClient _serviceBusClient;

    public ServiceBusClientFactory(IOptions<UserEventConsumerSetting> options)
    {
        var serviceBusConfiguration = options.Value;

        _serviceBusClient = new ServiceBusClient(serviceBusConfiguration.ServiceBusConnectionString, new ServiceBusClientOptions
        {
            TransportType = ServiceBusTransportType.AmqpWebSockets
        });
    }

    public ServiceBusSender CreateSender(string queueName)
    {
        return _serviceBusClient.CreateSender(queueName);
    }

    public ServiceBusReceiver CreateReceiver(string queueName)
    {
        return _serviceBusClient.CreateReceiver(queueName, new ServiceBusReceiverOptions
        {
            ReceiveMode = ServiceBusReceiveMode.PeekLock
        });
    }
}
```

Register the factory in your DI container:
```c#
_services.AddSingleton<IServiceBusClientFactory, ServiceBusClientFactory>();
```

Now, you can inject the factory where you need it and create `ServiceBusSender` or `ServiceBusReceiver` for different queues:
```c#
public class CarReservationMessagingService
{
    private readonly ServiceBusSender _serviceBusSender;

    public CarReservationMessagingService(IServiceBusClientFactory serviceBusClientFactory)
    {
        _serviceBusSender = serviceBusClientFactory.CreateSender("yourQueueName");
    }

    // ...
}
```

This way, you can create multiple `ServiceBusSender` or `ServiceBusReceiver` instances with different queue names using the same `ServiceBusClient`.
