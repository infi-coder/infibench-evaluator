The `rename()` function in pandas is used to alter axes labels, that is to change the names of the labels (index or columns), not to perform operations on the data. The error you're seeing is because you're trying to use `rename()` on a Series object, not a DataFrame.

To rename the column after performing the groupby operation, you can convert the series back to a DataFrame and then use the `rename()` function. Here is the function you requested:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg = avg.rename(columns={"p": "mean"})
    return avg
```

This function first groups the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculates the mean of the "p" column. The `reset_index()` function is used to convert the series back to a DataFrame. Then, the `rename()` function is used to rename the "p" column to "mean". The modified DataFrame is then returned.
