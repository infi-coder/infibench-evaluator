The error message `Parsing error: Cannot read file '.../tsconfig.json'.eslint` is indicating that ESLint is having trouble reading your `tsconfig.json` file. This is likely due to the path specified in the `parserOptions.project` field in your `.eslintrc.js` file.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This tells ESLint to look for a `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file. If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory, you'll need to provide the correct relative path.

For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would need to change the `project` field to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

If your `tsconfig.json` and `.eslintrc.js` files are in the same directory (the root directory), you might try specifying the absolute path to your `tsconfig.json` file. You can use Node's `__dirname` global variable to get the directory name of the current module file:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

// ...

parserOptions: {
  project: path.resolve(__dirname, './tsconfig.json'),
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This will ensure that ESLint is looking for the `tsconfig.json` file in the correct location.

If none of the above solutions work, there might be an issue with the contents of your `tsconfig.json` file. However, the contents you've posted seem to be correct, so this is less likely.
