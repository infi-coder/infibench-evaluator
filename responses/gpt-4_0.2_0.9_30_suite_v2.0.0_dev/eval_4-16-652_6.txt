AWS CLI version 2 introduced automatic paging for commands that return multiple pages of output. This is why you're seeing the pager pop up. 

You can disable this feature by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. You can do this in your script before running the AWS CLI commands:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

So your script would look like this:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""

for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will disable the pager for the duration of your script. If you want to disable it permanently, you can add the `export AWS_PAGER=""` line to your shell's profile script (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash).
