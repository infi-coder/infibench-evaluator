The error message `Parsing error: Cannot read file '.../tsconfig.json'.eslint` is indicating that ESLint is unable to find or read your `tsconfig.json` file. This is likely because the `project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file is not correctly pointing to your `tsconfig.json` file.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

The `project` property is set to `"tsconfig.json"`, which means ESLint will look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file. If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory, you will need to provide the correct relative path.

For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would need to change the `project` property to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in a different directory, adjust the path accordingly. If your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory and your `.eslintrc.js` file is also in the root directory, you can leave it as `"tsconfig.json"`.

After you've made the changes, save the `.eslintrc.js` file and restart your editor. If the problem persists, there may be a problem with your `tsconfig.json` file, such as a syntax error or incorrect configuration.
