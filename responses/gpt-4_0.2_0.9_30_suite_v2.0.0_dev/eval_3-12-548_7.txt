Use `WillPopScope` instead of `Navigator.pop(context)` or `Navigator.of(context).pop()`. 

`WillPopScope` is a widget that detects when the user has pressed the back button on their device. It has a `onWillPop` property where you can handle the back button press event. You can simply return `Future.value(false)` to disable the back button.

Here is an example:

```dart
return WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () async => false, // this will disable the back button
  child: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('Login Page'),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: Text('Login Page'),
    ),
  ),
);
```

In this example, when the user presses the back button, the `onWillPop` function will be called and it will return a future that resolves to false. This will effectively disable the back button.
