The error message you're seeing indicates that Go is unable to find the specific version of the module you're trying to import. This could be due to a number of reasons:

- The module version does not exist.
- There are network issues preventing Go from accessing the module.
- There are authentication issues preventing Go from accessing the module.

Since you mentioned that the module is in a private repository, it's likely that the issue is related to authentication. Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your Git configuration:** Make sure that Git is configured correctly to access private repositories. You can do this by running `git config --list` and checking the output.

2. **Check your Go configuration:** Go uses the `GOPRIVATE` environment variable to determine which modules should be treated as private. You should set this variable to the path of your private repository. For example:

    ```bash
    export GOPRIVATE=github.ibm.com/kms/*
    ```

3. **Use Go modules proxy:** If you're using Go 1.13 or later, you can use a Go modules proxy to access private modules. You can configure this by setting the `GOPROXY` environment variable. For example:

    ```bash
    export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
    ```

4. **Check your network connection:** If you're still having issues, it might be worth checking your network connection. Try accessing the module repository directly from your browser to see if you can reach it.

5. **Check the module version:** Finally, make sure that the version of the module you're trying to import actually exists. You can do this by checking the repository's tags or releases.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider asking for help on the Go community forums or on Stack Overflow.
