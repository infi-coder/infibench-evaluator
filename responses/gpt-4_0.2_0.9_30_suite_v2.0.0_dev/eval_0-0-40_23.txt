The error message you're seeing is due to a conflict between the Windows version of Node.js and the version installed in WSL2. The Windows version is not compatible with WSL2, and you're seeing this error because the `npm` command is trying to use the Windows version.

To resolve this issue, you need to remove the Windows version from your PATH within WSL2. You can do this by editing your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file.

Here are the steps:

1. Open your `.bashrc` file in a text editor. You can use `nano` for this:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Add the following line to the end of the file:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin
```

This line adds `/usr/bin` to your PATH, which is where the WSL2 version of `node` and `npm` are located.

3. Save the file and exit the text editor. If you're using `nano`, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm that you want to save the changes, and then `Enter` to confirm the file name.

4. Close your terminal and open a new one, or source your `.bashrc` file to apply the changes immediately:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

5. Now, when you run `node -v` and `npm -v`, you should see the versions installed in WSL2, and you should no longer see the error message.

If you still encounter issues, you might need to uninstall the Windows version of Node.js and only use the version installed in WSL2.
