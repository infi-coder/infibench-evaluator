The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling zip archives. It's not a Composer package, so you can't install it with `composer require`.

If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can install it with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you're using Windows, you can enable it in your `php.ini` file by uncommenting (or adding) the line:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

Then, you need to restart your web server.

After that, you should add `ext-zip` to your `composer.json` file to indicate that your project depends on this PHP extension. Here's how to do it:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1.3",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer install` again.

If you're using PHPStorm, it should now recognize that `ext-zip` is installed. If it doesn't, you may need to restart PHPStorm or reconfigure your PHP interpreter in PHPStorm settings.
