The `Get-Service` cmdlet in PowerShell does not provide the service description. However, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to retrieve the description of a service. Here is an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service" | 
    Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description | 
    Out-GridView
```

This command retrieves all services (`Win32_Service`) and selects the `Name`, `DisplayName`, and `Description` properties of each service. The output is then displayed in a grid view.

If you want to get the description of a specific service, you can filter the services by name. For example, to get the description of the `wuauserv` service, you can use the following command:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service Where Name = 'wuauserv'" | 
    Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description
```

This command retrieves the service with the name `wuauserv` and selects the `Name`, `DisplayName`, and `Description` properties of the service.
