You should use `@Configuration` when you want to define beans explicitly in your application. It is typically used in situations where you need to create Spring Beans using third-party classes that you can't annotate directly. 

On the other hand, `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Component` are used to auto-detect and auto-configure beans using classpath scanning. They are typically used for defining beans for your own classes.

So, if you need more control over the bean creation process, or need to work with third-party classes, use `@Configuration`. If you are working with your own classes and are okay with Spring's default configuration, use `@Service`, `@Controller`, or `@Component`.
