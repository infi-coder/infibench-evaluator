The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. Indexes can only be created on scalar properties, such as `int`, `string`, `DateTime`, etc.

In your case, you are trying to create an index on `Gender`, which is a navigation property. If you want to create an index on `GenderId`, which is a foreign key and a scalar property, you should do it like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

This way, you are creating an index on `GenderId`, which is a scalar property and it's allowed.
