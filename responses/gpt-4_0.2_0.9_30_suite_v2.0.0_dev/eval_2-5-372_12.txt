It seems like you're facing a version conflict issue. Hibernate Validator 5.x does not support `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` for `String` types. These annotations are supported from Hibernate Validator 6.x onwards.

The error message you're seeing is because your application is using Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2 at runtime, even though Maven is resolving Hibernate Validator 6.0.11.

This is likely because JBoss is providing Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2, and this version is being used instead of the one Maven is resolving.

To solve this issue, you can try the following:

1. **Exclude the Hibernate Validator provided by JBoss**: You can do this by creating a `jboss-deployment-structure.xml` file in your `WEB-INF` directory with the following content:

```xml
<jboss-deployment-structure>
    <deployment>
        <exclusions>
            <module name="org.hibernate.validator" />
        </exclusions>
    </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
```

2. **Include Hibernate Validator 6.x in your application**: You can do this by adding the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

3. **Ensure that your application is using JSR 380 (Bean Validation 2.0)**: Hibernate Validator 6.x is an implementation of JSR 380, so you need to make sure that your application is using this version of the Bean Validation API. You can do this by adding the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.validation</groupId>
    <artifactId>validation-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

After making these changes, rebuild your application and redeploy it to JBoss. This should solve your issue.
