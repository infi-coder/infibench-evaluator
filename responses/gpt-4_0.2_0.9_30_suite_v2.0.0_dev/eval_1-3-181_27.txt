Sure, you can use the `numpy.amax` function to find the maximum value along a specified axis. Here is the function you requested:

```python
import numpy as np

def getMax(matrix):
    # Select the third column from each 2D array and find the max value
    max_values = np.amax(matrix[:,:,2], axis=1)
    # Reshape the result to a 2D array
    max_values = max_values.reshape(-1, 1)
    return max_values
```

This function works by first selecting the third column from each 2D array in the 3D array (using `matrix[:,:,2]`). The `numpy.amax` function is then used to find the maximum value along the first axis (i.e., the rows) of each 2D array. Finally, the result is reshaped to a 2D array with one column.
