The error message is indicating that the `go_package` option is missing in your `.proto` file. This option is used to specify the package name for the generated Go code.

You can fix this by adding the `go_package` option to your `.proto` file. Here's how you can do it:

```protobuf
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "main";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

In this case, the `go_package` option is set to "main". This means that the generated Go code will be in the "main" package.

After making this change, you should be able to generate the Go code without any issues.
