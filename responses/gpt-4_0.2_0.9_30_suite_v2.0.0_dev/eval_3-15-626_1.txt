Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few things you need to adjust:

1. `query` and `currentSheet` should be declared as variables.
2. You are trying to use the value of a cell as the name of a query, which is not correct. You should create a Power Query first, then use its name in your VBA code.
3. The `Location` in the connection string should be the name of the Power Query, not the name of a cell or a variable.

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As String

    ' The name of your Power Query
    query = "YourPowerQueryName"
    currentSheet = ActiveSheet.Name

    With ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

Replace `"YourPowerQueryName"` with the actual name of your Power Query. This code will refresh the Power Query and load the result into the `target` sheet starting from cell A1.
