The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vite's development server is binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) by default, which is not accessible from outside the Docker container. 

To fix this, you need to configure Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0` so it can be accessed from outside the Docker container. You can do this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server from your host machine at `localhost:8080`.
