The `*-plain.jar` is generated by the `bootJar` task in Spring Boot 2.5.0. If you want to disable it, you can configure the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file like this:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will prevent the generation of the `*-plain.jar` file. However, be aware that this will also disable the generation of the executable `*.jar` file. If you want to keep the executable `*.jar` file, you can use the following configuration:

```groovy
bootJar {
    classifier = ''
}
```

This will generate only the executable `*.jar` file without the `*-plain.jar` file.
