The error you're seeing is due to changes in Android 12 (API level 31) regarding `PendingIntent` mutability. Starting from this version, you must explicitly specify whether a `PendingIntent` is mutable or immutable by using `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` or `FLAG_MUTABLE`.

The issue you're experiencing is a known issue with `MediaSessionCompat` in the AndroidX Media library version 1.4.0. The library is not yet fully compatible with Android 12.

The AndroidX team has fixed this issue in the AndroidX Media library version 1.4.3. So, you should update your dependency to the latest version.

In your `build.gradle` file, update the version of the AndroidX Media library:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.media:media:1.4.3'
}
```

After updating the library, clean and rebuild your project. The issue should be resolved.
