You need to call the `toast` method with the `show` option on your toast element to make it visible. Here's how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This line of code will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event (like a button click), you can put this line inside an event handler.

Also, make sure that you have included the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JS files in your HTML file. The toast component requires Bootstrap's JavaScript and jQuery. Here's an example of how to include them:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- JS, Popper.js, and jQuery -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Please replace the URLs with the version of Bootstrap you are using.
