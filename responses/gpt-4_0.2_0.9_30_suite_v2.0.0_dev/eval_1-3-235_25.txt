The error you're encountering is because the 'year' column contains floating point numbers represented as strings, and you're trying to convert them directly to integers. Python's `int()` function doesn't handle this situation well.

You can solve this problem by first converting the strings to floats, and then converting the floats to integers. Here's how you can do it:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

This function first converts the 'year' column to floats, and then to integers. This should work even if the 'year' column contains floating point numbers represented as strings.
