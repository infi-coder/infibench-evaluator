The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

```bash
pip install zlib
```

If that doesn't work, you can try installing Pillow with pre-built binaries by running the following command:

```bash
pip install --only-binary :all: pillow
```

Alternatively, you can try installing Pillow from a wheel file. First, download the appropriate wheel file for your system from https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/#files. Then, navigate to the directory where the wheel file is located and run the following command:

```bash
pip install <wheel_file_name>.whl
```

Replace `<wheel_file_name>` with the actual name of the wheel file you downloaded.
