The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is an extension that needs to be installed on your server or local machine. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -m | grep zip
   ```

   If the output contains `zip`, then the extension is already installed.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The installation process varies depending on your operating system. Here are the commands for some common operating systems:

   - Ubuntu/Debian:

     ```
     sudo apt-get install php-zip
     ```

   - CentOS/RHEL:

     ```
     sudo yum install php-zip
     ```

   - macOS (with Homebrew):

     ```
     brew install php-zip
     ```

3. After installing the extension, restart your web server or PHP-FPM service:

   - Apache:

     ```
     sudo service apache2 restart
     ```

   - Nginx:

     ```
     sudo service php-fpm restart
     ```

   - PHP built-in web server:

     ```
     php -S localhost:8000 -d extension=zip.so
     ```

   Note: The exact command to restart your web server or PHP-FPM service may vary depending on your operating system and setup.

After installing the `ext-zip` extension and restarting your server, you should be able to use it in your PHP code without any issues.
