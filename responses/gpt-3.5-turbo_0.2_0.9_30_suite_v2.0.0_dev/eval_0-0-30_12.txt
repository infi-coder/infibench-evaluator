As of Enzyme version 3.11.0, there is no official adapter for React 17 yet. However, you can use the adapter for React 16 with React 17 without any issues.

Here's the updated code snippet:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Note that you need to install the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package separately. You can do this by running the following command:

```
npm install --save-dev @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

With this adapter, you should be able to write unit tests for your React 17 app using Enzyme.
