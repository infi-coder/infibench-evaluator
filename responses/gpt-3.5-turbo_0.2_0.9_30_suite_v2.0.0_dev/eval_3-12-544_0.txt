The error message indicates that the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` method is returning `null`. This can happen if the path_provider plugin is not properly initialized.

Make sure that you have added the `path_provider` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file and have run `flutter pub get` to download the package.

Also, make sure that you have imported the `path_provider` package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
```

If you have done all of the above and are still getting the error, try running `flutter clean` to clear the build cache and then run `flutter pub get` again.

If the issue persists, try running the app on a different device or emulator to see if the issue is specific to your current environment.
