You can use the following command to restart your current terminal session without closing the window on MacOS:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This will reload your updated `.bash_profile` file and apply any changes you made to it. 

Alternatively, you can also use the following command:

```
. ~/.bash_profile
```

Both commands achieve the same result of reloading your `.bash_profile` file and updating your terminal session without closing the window.
