You need to add two things to your `~/.zshenv`. First, add the rbenv initialization code itself and second, add the ruby version. Here's an example:

```
# Add rbenv to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"

# Initialize rbenv
eval "$(rbenv init -)"

# Set global Ruby version
rbenv global 2.7.2
```

You might also run the `rbenv doctor` command to check your installation.
