You need to add two things to your `~/.zshenv`. First, add the rbenv initialization code itself and second, add the ruby path. 

To add the rbenv initialization code, add the following line to your `~/.zshenv` file:
```
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

To add the ruby path, add the following line to your `~/.zshenv` file:
```
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/shims:${PATH}"
```

You might also run the `rbenv doctor` command to check your installation.
