In your `if` statement, you are using single quotes around `$searchT`, which means that the variable will not be expanded. To fix this, you can use double quotes instead. Here's the corrected code:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

In this code, we have replaced the single quotes around `$searchT` with double quotes. We have also added a pipe to the `grep` command in the `echo` statement to count the number of matches.
