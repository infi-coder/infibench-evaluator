The error message suggests that your current PHP version and extensions are not compatible with Laravel 9. Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher and some extensions like `mbstring`, `xml`, `curl`, `zip`, `gd`, and `mysqlnd` to be installed.

You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -v
```

If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you need to upgrade it to a higher version. You can follow the official PHP documentation to upgrade your PHP version.

Once you have upgraded your PHP version, make sure that all the required extensions are installed. You can check the list of required extensions in the Laravel documentation.

After installing the required extensions, try running the `composer create-project` command again. It should work without any issues.
