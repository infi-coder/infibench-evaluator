It seems that the Dockerfile cannot find the `app` module. You can try modifying the `COPY` command in your Dockerfile to include the parent directory of the `app` module. Here's an updated version of your Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /
RUN pip install --requirement /requirements.txt

COPY ./fastapi /app/fastapi

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "fastapi.app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

In this version, we're copying the `fastapi` directory instead of the `app` directory, and we're specifying the full path to the `main` module in the `CMD` command. This should allow Docker to find the `app` module and run your application.
