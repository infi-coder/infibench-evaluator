You can use `grep` with a regular expression to match the `lang` attribute value regardless of its position in the HTML tag. Here's an example command that should work for both cases:

```
curl -Ls yahoo.com | grep -oP 'lang="\K[^"]+' | head -1
```

This command uses the `-o` option to output only the matched text, and the `-P` option to enable Perl-compatible regular expressions. The regular expression `lang="\K[^"]+` matches the `lang` attribute value by looking for the string `lang="` and then using `\K` to reset the match so that only the value is captured. The `[^"]+` part matches one or more characters that are not double quotes, which corresponds to the attribute value.

Note that this assumes that the `lang` attribute is always enclosed in double quotes. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.
