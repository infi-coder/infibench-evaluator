Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended approach because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly shows the dependencies required by the class and ensures that they are provided at the time of instantiation. It also makes the class immutable, which is a good practice for writing testable code. However, if you prefer to use the setter injection, you can still do that without the `@Autowired` annotation.
