The error message "419 Page Expired" is related to the CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token. The CSRF token is a security feature in Laravel that prevents unauthorized access to your application. When you log out from one tab, the CSRF token is invalidated, and if you try to log out from another tab with the same CSRF token, it will result in a "419 Page Expired" error.

To avoid this error, you can add a check in your logout function to see if the CSRF token is valid before logging out. You can do this by adding the `csrf` middleware to your logout route. This middleware will check if the CSRF token is valid before allowing the request to proceed.

Here's an example of how you can add the `csrf` middleware to your logout route:

```
Route::post('/logout', 'Auth\LoginController@logout')->middleware('csrf');
```

With this middleware in place, when you try to log out from a tab with an expired CSRF token, the middleware will detect the invalid token and redirect you to the login page instead of showing the "419 Page Expired" error.
