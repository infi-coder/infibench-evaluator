To write a list of lists into an Excel file using Python, we can use the `openpyxl` library. Here's the code for the `writeExcel()` function:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeExcel():
    # Create a new workbook
    workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()

    # Select the active worksheet
    worksheet = workbook.active

    # Define the data to be written
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

    # Write the data to the worksheet
    for row in new_list:
        worksheet.append(row)

    # Save the workbook
    workbook.save(filename="data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new Excel workbook, selects the active worksheet, writes the data to the worksheet, and saves the workbook as "data.xlsx". You can call this function to write the list of lists to an Excel file.
