Here are some steps you can try to solve the issue:

1. Make sure that the Jupyter package is installed in your virtual environment. You can do this by activating your virtual environment and running the command `conda list` or `pip list` to see if Jupyter is listed.

2. Check if the Jupyter extension is installed in VS Code. You can do this by going to the Extensions tab in VS Code and searching for "Jupyter". If it is not installed, install it and restart VS Code.

3. Try launching Jupyter notebook from the command line by activating your virtual environment and running the command `jupyter notebook`. If it works, then the issue may be with the VS Code extension.

4. If none of the above steps work, try creating a new virtual environment and installing Jupyter and the necessary packages in it. Then try launching Jupyter notebook from within VS Code.

5. If the issue persists, try uninstalling and reinstalling both VS Code and Miniconda.

Hopefully, one of these steps will solve the issue and allow you to launch Jupyter notebook from within VS Code.
