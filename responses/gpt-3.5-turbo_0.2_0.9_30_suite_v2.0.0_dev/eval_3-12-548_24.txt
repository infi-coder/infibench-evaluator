To disable the back button in Flutter when you have reached the login page after logging out, you can use the `pushReplacement` method of the `Navigator` class. This method replaces the current route with a new route, and prevents the user from navigating back to the previous route using the back button.

Here's an example:

```
Navigator.pushReplacement(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => LoginPage()),
);
```

In this example, `LoginPage` is the new route that replaces the current route. When the user logs out and reaches this page, the `pushReplacement` method is called to replace the current route with the `LoginPage`. This prevents the user from navigating back to the previous page using the back button.

Note that you can also use the `pushNamedAndRemoveUntil` method to achieve the same result. This method pushes a new route onto the navigator and removes all the previous routes until a certain condition is met. In this case, you can remove all the previous routes until you reach the login page.

```
Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(
  context,
  '/login',
  (route) => false,
);
```

In this example, `'/login'` is the name of the login page route, and `(route) => false` is a condition that always returns false, which means that all the previous routes will be removed.
