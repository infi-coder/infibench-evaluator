The error message "419 Page Expired" is related to the CSRF token. Laravel uses CSRF tokens to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks. When you log out from one tab, the CSRF token is invalidated, and if you try to log out from another tab with the same CSRF token, it will fail with the "419 Page Expired" error message.

To avoid this error message, you can add a check in your logout function to see if the CSRF token is still valid. If it is not valid, you can simply redirect the user to the login page. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```
public function logout(Request $request)
{
    if ($request->session()->regenerateToken()) {
        Auth::logout();
        $request->session()->invalidate();
        return redirect('/login');
    }
}
```

In this example, we regenerate the CSRF token, log out the user, invalidate the session, and then redirect the user to the login page. This way, even if the user tries to log out from another tab with an expired CSRF token, they will be redirected to the login page instead of seeing the "419 Page Expired" error message.
