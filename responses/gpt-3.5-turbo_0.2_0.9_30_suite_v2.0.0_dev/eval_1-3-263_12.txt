The "f" in `print(f"...")` is used to format strings in Python 3.6 and above. It is called an f-string or formatted string literal. 

With f-strings, you can embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {}. The expressions inside the curly braces are evaluated at runtime and then formatted using the format specification mini-language. 

In the code you provided, the curly braces are used to embed the values of variables `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` inside the string literals. The values of these variables are then printed along with the string. 

For example, if `args.input_directory` is equal to "input" and `args.output_directory` is equal to "output", the output of the two print statements would be:

```
Input directory: input
Output directory: output
```
