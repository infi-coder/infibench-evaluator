The error message "419 Page Expired" is related to Laravel's CSRF protection. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a type of attack where a malicious website can execute unwanted actions on a web application where the user is currently authenticated. Laravel's CSRF protection adds a token to each form submitted to the server, and it checks if the token is valid before processing the request.

In your case, the issue is that the token in the second tab has expired because you logged out from the first tab. When you click the logout button in the second tab, it sends a request with an expired token, and Laravel rejects the request with the "419 Page Expired" error.

To avoid this issue, you can add a check in your logout code to see if the token is expired, and if it is, regenerate a new token before processing the logout request. Here is an example code:

```
public function logout(Request $request)
{
    if ($request->session()->regenerateToken()) {
        Auth::logout();
        $request->session()->invalidate();
    }
    return redirect('/');
}
```

This code regenerates the token using the `regenerateToken()` method, which returns `true` if the token is regenerated successfully. Then it logs out the user using the `Auth::logout()` method and invalidates the session using the `invalidate()` method. Finally, it redirects the user to the home page.

By regenerating the token before processing the logout request, you ensure that the token is always valid, even if the user has multiple tabs open with the same session.
