For the first question, the issue could be related to the session configuration on the host domain. You may want to check if the session driver is set correctly on the host domain and if the session files are being stored properly. Additionally, you may want to check if there are any conflicting configurations on the host domain that could be affecting the session management of your Laravel application.

For the second question, the error message suggests that there is an issue with the SSL certificate. You may want to try changing the encryption method to `tls` instead of `ssl` in your `.env` file and see if that resolves the issue. Additionally, you may want to check if the SMTP server requires any specific SSL/TLS configuration or if there are any firewall rules that could be blocking the connection.
