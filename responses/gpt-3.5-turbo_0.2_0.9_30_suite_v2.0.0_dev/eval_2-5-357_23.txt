Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly indicates that the class has a dependency on another class and that Spring should provide an instance of that dependency when creating an instance of the class. Additionally, using constructor injection with `@Autowired` ensures that the dependency is injected at the time of object creation, making the class immutable and thread-safe. However, if you prefer to use setter injection or field injection, those options are still available in Spring.
