For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server's clock is not synchronized with the client's clock, causing the token to expire before it should. Another possibility is that the session is not being properly maintained on the server, causing the token to be lost or regenerated. You could try increasing the SESSION_LIFETIME to see if that helps, or try using a different session driver.

For the second issue, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used is not supported by the server. You could try changing the MAIL_ENCRYPTION to 'tls' instead of 'ssl', as that is the more commonly used encryption for SMTP. You could also try changing the MAIL_PORT to 465, which is the default port for SMTP over SSL. If those don't work, you may need to contact the email provider to see what encryption and port settings they support.
