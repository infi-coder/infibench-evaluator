Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended approach in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It also ensures that the required dependencies are injected at the time of object creation, making the object ready for use immediately. Additionally, it makes the class more testable as you can easily mock the dependencies in the constructor during unit testing. However, if you prefer to use the constructor without `@Autowired`, you can still do so as Spring supports constructor injection by default.
