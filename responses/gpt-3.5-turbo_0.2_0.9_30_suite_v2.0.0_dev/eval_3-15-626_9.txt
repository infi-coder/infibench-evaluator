You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate a Power Query. Here's an example code to load data from a Power Query to a worksheet:

```
Sub LoadPowerQueryToWorksheet()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Dim sheet As Worksheet
    
    ' Set the connection to the Power Query
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections("Query - MyQueryName")
    
    ' Set the sheet to load the data to
    Set sheet = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet2")
    
    ' Refresh the connection and load the data to the sheet
    conn.Refresh
    conn.OLEDBConnection.Worksheet.Cells(2, 1).CopyFromRecordset conn.OLEDBConnection.Resultset
End Sub
```

Replace "Query - MyQueryName" with the name of your Power Query connection, and "Sheet2" with the name of the sheet you want to load the data to.
