You can try using the `rename` command to remove the question mark and everything after it from the file names. Here's an example command:

```
find . -type f -name '*\?*' -exec rename 's/\?.*//' {} \;
```

This command will find all files with a question mark in their name, and then use the `rename` command to remove the question mark and everything after it.
