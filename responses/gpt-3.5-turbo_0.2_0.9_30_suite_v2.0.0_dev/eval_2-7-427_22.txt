For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server's clock is not synchronized with the client's clock, causing the token to expire before it should. Another possibility is that the session is not being properly persisted between requests, causing the server to generate a new token for each request. You could try increasing the SESSION_LIFETIME to see if that resolves the issue. Additionally, you could check if the server's timezone is set correctly and ensure that the session driver is properly configured.

For the second issue, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used is incorrect. You could try changing the encryption type to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' in your .env file and see if that resolves the issue. Additionally, you could check if the SMTP server requires a specific SSL version and configure your application accordingly.
