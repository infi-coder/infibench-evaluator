For the first question, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the domain where the application is hosted is not set up correctly to handle sessions. You can try changing the SESSION_DOMAIN value in the .env file to the domain where the application is hosted. Another possibility is that there is a mismatch between the token generated by the browser and the token stored in the session. You can try clearing the browser cache and cookies to see if that resolves the issue.

For the second question, the error message "SSL operation failed with code 1. OpenSSL Error messages: error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number" suggests that the SSL version being used is not supported by the server. You can try changing the MAIL_ENCRYPTION value in the .env file to 'tls' instead of 'ssl'. If that doesn't work, you can try contacting the server administrator to see if they can provide more information on the supported SSL versions.
