To split the data into 5 separate columns, you can use the `Split` function in VBA. Here's an example of how you can modify the code:

```
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim cabinetInfo As Variant
    cabinetInfo = Split(textline, ",")
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = cabinetInfo(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = cabinetInfo(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = cabinetInfo(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = cabinetInfo(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = cabinetInfo(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code assumes that the data in `textline` is separated by commas. The `Split` function splits the string into an array, which you can then assign to separate cells in the Excel sheet.
