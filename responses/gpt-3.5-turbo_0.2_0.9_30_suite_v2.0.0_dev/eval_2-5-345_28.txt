This error occurs because IntelliJ IDEA is using an older version of Maven (3.6.3) than the one used by the Spring Boot project (3.8.5). The `NoSuchMethodError` exception is thrown because the constructor for `DefaultModelValidator` has changed between these two versions of Maven.

To fix this issue, you can configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the same version of Maven as the Spring Boot project. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Open the Maven settings in IntelliJ IDEA by going to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.
2. In the "Maven home directory" field, enter the path to the Maven installation used by the Spring Boot project. This should be the same path as the `MAVEN_HOME` environment variable used by the project.
3. Click "OK" to save the settings.

After configuring IntelliJ IDEA to use the same version of Maven as the Spring Boot project, you should be able to import the project without encountering the `NoSuchMethodError` exception.
