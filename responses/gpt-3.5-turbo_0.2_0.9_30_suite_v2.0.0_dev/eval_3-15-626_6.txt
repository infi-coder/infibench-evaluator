You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate Power Query. Here's an example code to load data from a query to a worksheet:

```
Sub LoadDataFromQuery()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Dim query As WorkbookQuery
    Dim targetSheet As Worksheet
    
    ' Get the query and target sheet
    Set query = ThisWorkbook.Queries("MyQuery")
    Set targetSheet = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet2")
    
    ' Add a new connection to the query
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections.Add2(Name:="MyConnection", Description:="", _
        ConnectionString:="OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query.Name, _
        CommandText:="SELECT * FROM [" & query.Name & "]", _
        lCmdtype:=xlCmdSql)
    
    ' Load the data to the target sheet
    With targetSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=xlSrcExternal, Source:=conn, _
        Destination:=targetSheet.Range("A1")).QueryTable
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With
    
    ' Delete the connection
    conn.Delete
End Sub
```

Note that you need to replace "MyQuery" and "Sheet2" with the names of your query and target sheet, respectively.
