This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, a popular Rust language server. It is a false positive and does not indicate an actual issue with your code. 

You can try updating rust-analyzer to the latest version to see if the error goes away. If it persists, you can ignore it or disable the rust-analyzer extension in your editor. 

To disable the rust-analyzer extension in VS Code, go to the Extensions tab, find rust-analyzer, and click the gear icon to open the extension settings. Then, uncheck the "Enabled" box to disable the extension.
