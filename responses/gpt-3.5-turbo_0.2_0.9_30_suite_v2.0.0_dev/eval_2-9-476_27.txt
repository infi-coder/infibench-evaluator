You need to add two things to your `~/.zshenv`. First, add the rbenv initialization itself by adding the line `eval "$(rbenv init -)"` to the file. Second, add the path to your Ruby installation by adding the line `export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/shims:$PATH"`. 

You might also run the command `rbenv doctor` to check your installation and make sure everything is set up correctly.
