To import images in a React component with TypeScript and Parcel, you need to do the following:

1. Create a `.d.ts` file with the same name as the image file you want to import. For example, if your image is named `image.jpg`, create a file named `image.d.ts`. Inside this file, add the following code:

```typescript
declare module '*.jpg' {
  const value: any;
  export default value;
}
```

This tells TypeScript that any file with a `.jpg` extension can be imported as a module.

2. Move the `.d.ts` file to the same directory as the image file. In your case, move `image.d.ts` to the `assets` directory.

3. In your component file, import the image like this:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import image from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```

Note that you don't need to specify the file extension when importing the image.

4. Add the following configuration to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.d.ts", "src/**/*.jpg"]
}
```

This tells TypeScript to include `.d.ts` and `.jpg` files in the compilation process.

5. Run `npm install --save-dev parcel-plugin-static-files-copy` to install the Parcel plugin that copies static files to the output directory.

6. Add the following configuration to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "parcel-plugin-static-files-copy": {
    "staticPath": [
      {
        "from": "src/assets",
        "to": "assets"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This tells Parcel to copy the `assets` directory to the output directory.

7. Run `npm start` to start the development server. Parcel should now be able to find and import the image file.
