You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after` pseudo-element and setting its `border-color` property to green. Here is an example CSS code:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    border-color: green;
}
```

You can add this CSS code to your stylesheet or add it to the `style` tag in your HTML file.
