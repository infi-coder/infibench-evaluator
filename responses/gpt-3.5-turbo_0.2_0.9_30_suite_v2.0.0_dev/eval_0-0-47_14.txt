Yes, you can define an interface for the object type and use it as the type for the array parameter. Here's an example:

```typescript
interface Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}

const bagTotal = (products: Product[]) => {
  // function does stuff
}
```

This defines an interface called `Product` with the required properties, and then uses it as the type for the `products` parameter in the `bagTotal` function. Now, TypeScript will enforce that any array passed to `bagTotal` must contain objects that match the `Product` interface.
