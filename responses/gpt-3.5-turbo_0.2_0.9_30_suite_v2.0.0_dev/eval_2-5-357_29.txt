Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended way of injecting dependencies in Spring. It makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It also ensures that the required dependencies are available at the time of object creation. However, if you are using Spring 4.3 or later, you can omit the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor as long as there is only one constructor in the class. Spring will automatically inject the dependencies based on the constructor parameter types.
