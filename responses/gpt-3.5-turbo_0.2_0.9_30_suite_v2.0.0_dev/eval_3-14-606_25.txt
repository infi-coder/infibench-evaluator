Developer mode is not a feature that can be enabled on iOS 16.0. It is possible that the alert you received is related to the provisioning profile used to sign the app. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the provisioning profile used to sign the app is still valid. You can do this by checking the expiration date of the profile in the Apple Developer portal.

2. Make sure that the device you are trying to install the app on is registered in the Apple Developer portal and has the necessary provisioning profile installed.

3. Try rebuilding the app with a new provisioning profile and reinstalling it on the device.

If none of these steps work, you may need to contact the developer of the app for further assistance.
