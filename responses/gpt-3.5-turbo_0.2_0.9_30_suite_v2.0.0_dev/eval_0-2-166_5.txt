TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides pre-defined classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. It doesn't provide a way to select elements using CSS selectors like `>`.

However, you can use the `@layer` directive in TailwindCSS to define your own custom CSS rules. Here's an example of how you can define a custom rule to select the direct children of a `div` element with class `section`:

```css
@layer components {
  div.section > div {
    /* your styles here */
  }
}
```

You can add this code to your `tailwind.config.js` file to define this custom rule. Then, you can use the `class` attribute in your HTML to apply this rule to your elements:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div>Direct child 1</div>
  <div>Direct child 2</div>
</div>
```

Note that this approach requires you to define your own CSS rules, which may not be as flexible or reusable as using standard CSS selectors.
