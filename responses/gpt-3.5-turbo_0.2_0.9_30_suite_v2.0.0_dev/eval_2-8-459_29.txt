It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` cannot be found or downloaded on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is available in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is not found, then it needs to be downloaded. If it is found, then it might be a versioning issue.

2. Try to download the module manually by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   This will download the module and its dependencies to the module cache.

3. Check if there are any network issues preventing the module from being downloaded. You can try to download the module using `curl` or `wget` to see if there are any errors.

4. Check if the module is available on the remote repository. You can try to access the module URL in a web browser or using `curl` to see if it is available.

5. Check if there are any issues with the versioning of the module. It is possible that the version `v0.1.5` is not available for the module. You can try to use a different version or a branch/tag name to see if it resolves the issue.

6. Check if there are any issues with the `go.mod` file. It is possible that the `go.mod` file is not correctly specifying the dependencies or versions. You can try to regenerate the `go.mod` file using `go mod tidy` and see if it resolves the issue.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you debug the issue and get the module downloaded on computer B.
