There are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Make sure that the `@EnableSwagger2` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application class. This annotation enables Swagger support for your application.

2. Check that the `@ComponentScan` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application class. This annotation scans the package where your controllers are located.

3. Verify that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` property is set in your `application.properties` file. This property specifies the URL path where the Swagger UI should be available. For example:

   ```
   springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/api-docs
   ```

4. Check that the `@RestController` annotation is present in your controller class. This annotation tells Spring that this class is a controller and should be scanned for Swagger documentation.

5. Verify that the `@ApiOperation` annotation is present in your controller methods. This annotation provides additional information about the API operation, such as the HTTP method, the path, and the response type.

If you have checked all of these things and are still experiencing issues, you may want to try restarting your application or clearing your browser cache.
