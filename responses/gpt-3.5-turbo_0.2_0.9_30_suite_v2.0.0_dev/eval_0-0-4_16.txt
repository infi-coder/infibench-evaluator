- Pressable and TouchableOpacity have the same basic functionalities. They both are for making a text/image pressable.

- Pressable has some new props, like `android_ripple` which you can use to define how far a touch can register away from the the wrapped element.

- On the other hand, TouchableOpacity also have some unique functionalities. For example, TouchableOpacity has automatic opacity change, where with Pressable you need to add your own custom opacity with Pressable's `style` prop. Furthermore, TouchableOpacity adds the fade-out animation on press. 

In general, if you need to customize the touch feedback or define a custom hit area, Pressable is a better choice. If you just need a simple pressable component with automatic opacity change and fade-out animation, TouchableOpacity is a good option.
