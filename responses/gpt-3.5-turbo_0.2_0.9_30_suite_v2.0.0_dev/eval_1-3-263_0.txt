The "f" in `print(f"...")` is used to create a formatted string literal, also known as an f-string. 

An f-string is a string literal that is prefixed with the letter "f" or "F". It allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {}. The expressions inside the curly braces are evaluated at runtime and their values are inserted into the string.

In your example, the expressions inside the curly braces are `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory`. These expressions are evaluated at runtime and their values are inserted into the string. The resulting string is then printed to the console.

For example, if `args.input_directory` is "/path/to/input" and `args.output_directory` is "/path/to/output", the output of the two print statements would be:

```
Input directory: /path/to/input
Output directory: /path/to/output
```
