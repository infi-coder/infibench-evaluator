You can use the `pip` package to check if a package is at its latest version programmatically. Here's the `checkVersion` function that takes the package name `pkgName` as the argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the package is at its latest version or not:

```python
import pip

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the latest version of the package
    latest_version = str(pip.get_installed_distributions()[0].version)
    pip_version = pip.__version__.split('.')
    # Check if the package is at its latest version
    try:
        pkg_version = str(pip.get_installed_distributions()[pkgName].version)
        return pkg_version == latest_version
    except KeyError:
        return False
```

Here's how you can use the `checkVersion` function:

```python
# Check if the package 'gekko' is at its latest version
if checkVersion('gekko'):
    print('Package is at its latest version')
else:
    print('Package is not at its latest version')
```
