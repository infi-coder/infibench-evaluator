There are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Make sure that the `@EnableSwagger2` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application. This annotation enables Swagger support in your application.

2. Check that the `@ComponentScan` annotation is scanning the package where your Swagger configuration is located. By default, Swagger configuration is located in the `com.your.package.config` package.

3. Verify that the `@Configuration` annotation is present in your Swagger configuration class.

4. Check that the `@EnableWebMvc` annotation is present in your Swagger configuration class. This annotation enables Spring MVC support in your application.

5. Make sure that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` property is set to `/swagger-ui.html` in your `application.properties` file. This is the default path for the Swagger UI.

6. Verify that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled` property is set to `true` in your `application.properties` file. This enables the Swagger UI in your application.

If you have checked all of these things and are still experiencing issues, try restarting your application and clearing your browser cache.
