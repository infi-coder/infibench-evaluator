You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and preserve the order in which they appear in the file. 

If you don't have a `.clang-format` file yet, you can create one in the root directory of your project and add the above line to it. 

Note that disabling the sorting of includes may lead to some issues with third-party libraries that require a specific include order. It's generally recommended to follow the recommended include order for the libraries you're using, even if it means manually adjusting the order of your includes.
