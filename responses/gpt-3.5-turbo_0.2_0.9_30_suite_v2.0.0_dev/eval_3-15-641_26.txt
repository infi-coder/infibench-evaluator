You can use the Windows API to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. Here's an example code snippet:

```
Private Declare Function SHGetKnownFolderPath Lib "shell32.dll" (ByRef rfid As Any, ByVal dwFlags As Long, ByVal hToken As Long, ByRef pszPath As Any) As Long

Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrive As String = "{A52BBA46-E9E1-435f-B3D9-28DAA648C0F6}"
Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro As String = "{7A3B4ADD-CC5F-4EBA-9B8C-2F8A0B52B1E2}"

Sub GetOneDriveLocalPath()
    Dim path As String
    Dim rfid As Variant
    
    If Application.Version < 15 Then
        rfid = FOLDERID_SkyDrive
    Else
        rfid = FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro
    End If
    
    If SHGetKnownFolderPath(rfid, 0, 0, path) = 0 Then
        MsgBox path
    Else
        MsgBox "Failed to get OneDrive local path."
    End If
End Sub
```

This code uses the `SHGetKnownFolderPath` function from the Windows API to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. The `FOLDERID_SkyDrive` and `FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro` constants are used to specify the OneDrive folder ID depending on the version of Office installed. Once you have the local path, you can use it to create folders and files on OneDrive using VBA.
