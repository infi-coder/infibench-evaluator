This warning is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled, which means that your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone without authentication. To fix this, you need to enable security in Elasticsearch.

Here are the steps to enable security in Elasticsearch:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file (`config/elasticsearch.yml`) in your Rails app.

2. Add the following lines to the bottom of the file:

   ```
   xpack.security.enabled: true
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
   ```

   These lines enable security and SSL encryption for Elasticsearch.

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

   If you're using Elasticsearch with Searchkick in development mode, you can restart Elasticsearch by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   bin/elasticsearch
   ```

   If you're using Elasticsearch with Searchkick in production mode, you'll need to restart Elasticsearch using your server's init system.

After enabling security in Elasticsearch, you'll need to create a user with the appropriate permissions to access your Elasticsearch cluster. You can follow the instructions in the Elasticsearch documentation to create a user with the necessary permissions: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html#security-minimal-setup.

Once you've created a user, you'll need to update your Rails app's Searchkick configuration to use the new user's credentials. You can do this by adding the following lines to your Rails app's `config/initializers/searchkick.rb` file:

```
Searchkick.client_options = {
  user: "your_username",
  password: "your_password"
}
```

Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with the username and password of the user you created in Elasticsearch.

After making these changes, the Elasticsearch warning should no longer appear.
