The error message "419 Page Expired" usually occurs when the CSRF token expires. The CSRF token is a security feature that Laravel uses to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.

To avoid this error message, you can try the following solutions:

1. Increase the session lifetime: You can increase the session lifetime in the `config/session.php` file. By default, the session lifetime is set to 120 minutes. You can increase it to a higher value to avoid the session from expiring too soon.

2. Use AJAX requests for logout: Instead of using a regular form submission for logout, you can use AJAX requests to send the logout request to the server. This way, the CSRF token will not expire and you will not see the "419 Page Expired" error message.

3. Handle the error gracefully: You can catch the "419 Page Expired" error message and handle it gracefully by redirecting the user to the login page or displaying a custom error message.

4. Use a package: There are several Laravel packages available that can help you handle CSRF token expiration gracefully. One such package is `laravel-frontend-preserver`, which automatically refreshes the CSRF token when it expires.
