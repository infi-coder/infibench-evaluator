You can try using the following command to restart your current terminal session without closing the window on MacOS:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will reload your updated `.bash_profile` file and apply any changes you made to it, including new aliases and prompts. 

Alternatively, you can also use the `exec zsh` command to switch to the Zsh shell, which is the default shell on newer versions of MacOS. This will also restart your terminal session without closing the window. 

```
exec zsh
```

Note that this command will only work if you have Zsh installed on your system.
