You can use the `pip` package to check if a package is at its latest version programmatically in Python. Here's an implementation of the `checkVersion` function:

```python
import pip

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the package information
    package_info = pip.get_installed_distributions()
    # Loop through the packages and check if the package is installed
    for package in package_info:
        if package.project_name == pkgName:
            # Check if the package is at its latest version
            latest_version = pip.get_latest_version(pkgName)
            if package.version == latest_version:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    # If the package is not installed, return False
    return False
```

This function first gets the information of all the installed packages using `pip.get_installed_distributions()`. Then it loops through the packages and checks if the given package name matches with any of the installed packages. If the package is found, it checks if the package is at its latest version using `pip.get_latest_version()`. If the package is at its latest version, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. If the package is not installed, it returns `False`.
