It seems like the issue is related to the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost`, which means it only accepts connections from the same machine. However, when you run the container, you are publishing the port to the host machine, which means that the Vite server needs to bind to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost` to accept connections from outside the container.

To fix this issue, you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file to specify the `host` option for the server:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0'
    }
})
```

This will tell Vite to bind to all available network interfaces, which should allow connections from outside the container.

After making this change, you can rebuild your Docker image and run the container again:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Then try accessing `localhost:8080` from your host machine again. It should now work as expected.
