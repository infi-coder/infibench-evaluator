Here's the updated code for the `divideNumber` function in Python:

```python
def divideNumber(num, n):
    quotient = num // n  # Initial quotient for each part
    remainder = num % n  # Remainder to be distributed among parts
    result = [quotient] * n  # Initializing the result list with initial quotient for each part
    for i in range(remainder):
        result[i] += 2  # Distributing the remainder by adding 2 to each part in succession
    return result
```

Here's how you can use the function:

```python
num = 100
n = 3
result = divideNumber(num, n)
print(result)  # Output: [34, 34, 32]
```

The function first calculates the initial quotient for each part by dividing `num` by `n`. It then calculates the remainder to be distributed among the parts. The function initializes the result list with the initial quotient for each part. It then distributes the remainder by adding 2 to each part in succession until the remainder is exhausted. Finally, it returns the result list.
