Here are some steps you can try to solve the issue:

1. Make sure that the Jupyter extension is installed in VS Code. You can check this by going to the Extensions tab on the left-hand side of the VS Code window and searching for "Jupyter". If it is not installed, install it and restart VS Code.

2. Check that the correct Python interpreter is selected in VS Code. You can do this by clicking on the bottom left corner of the VS Code window where it says the name of the current interpreter. Make sure that the interpreter you want to use (in this case, the one in the "da38" environment) is selected.

3. Try launching Jupyter notebook from the command line instead of from within VS Code. Open a terminal window in VS Code (Terminal -> New Terminal) and activate the "da38" environment by running the command `conda activate da38`. Then run the command `jupyter notebook` to launch Jupyter notebook. If it launches successfully, you can try connecting to the kernel from within VS Code again.

4. If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling both VS Code and Miniconda. Make sure to completely remove all files associated with both programs before reinstalling.
