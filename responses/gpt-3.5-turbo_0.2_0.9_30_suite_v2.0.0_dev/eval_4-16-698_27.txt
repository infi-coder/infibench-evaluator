You can use the following command to restart your current terminal session without closing the window on MacOS:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will reload your updated `.bash_profile` file and apply any changes you made to it. It's equivalent to logging out and logging back in again, but without actually closing the terminal window.

Alternatively, you can use the `exec zsh` command to switch to the Zsh shell, which is the default shell on MacOS. This will also restart your terminal session without closing the window.
