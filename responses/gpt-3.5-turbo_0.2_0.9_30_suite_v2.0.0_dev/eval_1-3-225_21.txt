Here's the revised code for the `pig_latin` function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
  words = text.split()
  pig_latin_words = []
  for word in words:
    endString = str(word[1:]).lower()
    startString = str(word[0]).lower()
    pig_latin_words.append(endString + startString + 'ay')
  return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)
```

The changes made to the original code are:

1. Instead of initializing `say` to an empty string, we initialize an empty list `pig_latin_words` to store the pig Latin words.
2. We iterate through each word in the `words` list and perform the pig Latin transformation on each word.
3. We append the transformed word to the `pig_latin_words` list.
4. Finally, we join the `pig_latin_words` list into a string with spaces in between each word and return it.

With these changes, the `pig_latin` function should now correctly transform the input text into pig Latin.
