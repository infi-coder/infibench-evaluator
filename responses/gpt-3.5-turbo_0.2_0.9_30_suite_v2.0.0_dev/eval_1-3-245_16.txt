It seems like the Dockerfile is unable to find the `app` module. You can try modifying the `COPY` command in the Dockerfile to include the parent directory of the `app` module. Here's an updated version of the Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /
RUN pip install --requirement /requirements.txt

COPY . /app

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

In this version, the `COPY` command copies the entire project directory into the Docker container's `/app` directory. This should include the `app` module and its dependencies.
