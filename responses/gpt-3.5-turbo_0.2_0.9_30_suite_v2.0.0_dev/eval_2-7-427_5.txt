For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server's clock is not synchronized with the client's clock, causing the token to expire before it should. Another possibility is that the session is being regenerated too frequently, causing the token to change unexpectedly. You can try increasing the SESSION_LIFETIME to see if that helps. Additionally, make sure that the domain and path settings in the session configuration match the domain and path of your application.

For the second issue, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used by the server is not compatible with the version expected by the client. You can try changing the encryption setting in your .env file to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' and see if that works. If not, you may need to contact the email server administrator to see if they can provide more information about the SSL version being used and how to configure your email client to use it.
