Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended way of injecting dependencies in Spring. It makes the code more readable and easier to test. Also, it ensures that the required dependencies are available at the time of object creation. However, if you are using Spring 4.3 or later, you can omit the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor if there is only one constructor in the class. Spring will automatically inject the dependencies into the constructor.
