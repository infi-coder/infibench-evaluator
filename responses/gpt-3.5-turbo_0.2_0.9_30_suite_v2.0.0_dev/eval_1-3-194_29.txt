To write a list of lists into an Excel file, we can use the `openpyxl` library. Here's the implementation of the `writeToExcel` function:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeToExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()
    sheet = workbook.active
    for row in new_list:
        sheet.append(row)
    workbook.save(filename="data.xlsx")
```

In this function, we first create a new list of lists called `new_list`. Then, we create a new Excel workbook using the `openpyxl.Workbook()` function. We get the active worksheet using the `workbook.active` property.

Next, we loop through each row in `new_list` and append it to the worksheet using the `sheet.append()` method. Finally, we save the workbook to a file named "data.xlsx" using the `workbook.save()` method.

You can call this function to create the Excel file and write the contents of `new_list` to it.
