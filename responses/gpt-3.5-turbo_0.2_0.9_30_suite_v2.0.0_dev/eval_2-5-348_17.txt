The error message suggests that there is an issue with the path to the `mvn.cmd` file. It seems that the path contains quotes that are causing the issue. 

One solution is to use the short name for the "Program Files" directory, which does not contain spaces and therefore does not require quotes. To find the short name, open a command prompt and navigate to the directory containing "Program Files". Then, run the command `dir /x` to display the short names for the directories. 

Once you have the short name for "Program Files", you can modify the command to use it instead of the full path with quotes. For example, if the short name for "Program Files" is "PROGRA~1", the modified command would be:

```
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\PROGRA~1\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "\"\"C:\\PROGRA~1\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd\" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path=\"C:\\PROGRA~1\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar\" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install\""
```

Alternatively, you can try escaping the quotes in the path by adding a backslash before each quote. For example:

```
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "\"\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd\" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path=\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar\" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install\""
```

Either of these solutions should resolve the issue with the malformed argument.
