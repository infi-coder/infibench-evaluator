You can add your existing SSH key to Git Bash by following these steps:

1. Open Git Bash and navigate to your home directory by typing `cd ~` and pressing Enter.
2. Create a new directory called `.ssh` by typing `mkdir .ssh` and pressing Enter.
3. Copy your SSH key file to the `.ssh` directory by typing `cp /d/keys/id_rsa .ssh/` (replace `/d/keys/id_rsa` with the path to your SSH key file) and pressing Enter.
4. Change the permissions of the SSH key file by typing `chmod 600 .ssh/id_rsa` and pressing Enter.

That's it! Your SSH key should now be added to Git Bash and ready to use.
