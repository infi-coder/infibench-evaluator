The error message is indicating that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. In your case, `Gender` is a navigation property because it is defined as `virtual` and it has a corresponding foreign key property `GenderId`.

To solve this problem, you can modify your `OnModelCreating` method to create the index on the `GenderId` property instead of the `Gender` navigation property. Here's the updated code:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId); // create index on GenderId
    });
}
```

With this change, you should be able to run `dotnet ef add migration User` without any errors.
