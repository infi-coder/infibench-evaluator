The `FormatException` is thrown when the JSON string returned by the PHP file is not in the expected format. To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the response from the PHP file by printing it to the console. You can use `print(response.body)` to print the response.

2. Validate the JSON string using an online JSON validator like https://jsonlint.com/. This will help you identify any syntax errors in the JSON string.

3. If the JSON string is valid, try using `jsonDecode` instead of `json.decode`. `jsonDecode` is a top-level function in the `dart:convert` library that returns a dynamic object instead of a `Map<String, dynamic>`. You can use it like this:

```dart
dynamic data = jsonDecode(response.body);
```

4. If the JSON string is not valid, you need to fix the PHP file to return a valid JSON string. You can use the `json_encode` function in PHP to encode an array or object as a JSON string. Here's an example:

```php
$data = array(
    "name" => "John Doe",
    "age" => 30,
    "email" => "johndoe@example.com"
);

echo json_encode($data);
```

This will output the following JSON string:

```json
{"name":"John Doe","age":30,"email":"johndoe@example.com"}
```

Make sure that the JSON string returned by the PHP file is in this format.
