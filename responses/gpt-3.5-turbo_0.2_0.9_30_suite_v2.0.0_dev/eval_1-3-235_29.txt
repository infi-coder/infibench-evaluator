The error is caused by the presence of a decimal point in the "year" column. To convert the column to integer, we need to remove the decimal point first. Here is the modified code:

```python
data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(str).str.split('.').str[0].astype(int)
```

This code first converts the "year" column to string, then splits each string by the decimal point and takes the first part, and finally converts the result to integer.

Here is the complete `transformation` function:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(str).str.split('.').str[0].astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

You can call this function with your dataframe as argument to get the transformed dataframe.
