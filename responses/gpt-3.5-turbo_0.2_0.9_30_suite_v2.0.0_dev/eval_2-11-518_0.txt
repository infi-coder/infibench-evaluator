The Rule of 5 is not outdated, as there are still cases where you may need to define these special member functions. While implicit constructors and destructors work fine for aggregate data structures, there are cases where you need to manage resources, such as memory or file handles, and in those cases, you need to define your own constructors and destructors.

Smart pointers can help manage resources, but they are not always a suitable replacement for user-defined constructors and destructors. For example, if you need to manage a resource that is not memory, such as a file handle or a network connection, a smart pointer may not be the best solution. Additionally, there may be cases where you need more fine-grained control over the resource management than what a smart pointer can provide.

In summary, while smart pointers can help manage resources, there are still cases where you may need to define your own constructors and destructors, and the Rule of 5 is still a useful guideline to follow.
