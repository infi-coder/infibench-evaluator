Sure, here's the code for the `writeToExcel` function that creates an Excel file named "data.xlsx" and writes the given list of lists into it:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeToExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
    sheet = wb.active
    for row in new_list:
        sheet.append(row)
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This code uses the `openpyxl` library to create an Excel workbook, add a new sheet to it, and then append the rows from the given list of lists to the sheet. Finally, it saves the workbook as an Excel file named "data.xlsx".
