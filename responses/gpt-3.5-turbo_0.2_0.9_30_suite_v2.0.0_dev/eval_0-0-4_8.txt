- Pressable and TouchableOpacity have the same basic functionalities. They both are for making a text/image clickable.
- Pressable has some new props, like `android_disableSound` which you can use to define how far a touch can register away from the the wrapped element.
- On the other hand, TouchableOpacity also have some unique functionalities. For example, TouchableOpacity has automatic opacity change, where with Pressable you need to add your own custom opacity with Pressable's `style` prop. Furthermore, TouchableOpacity adds the fade-out animation on press. 

In general, if you need a simple clickable element, either Pressable or TouchableOpacity can be used. However, if you need more customization options or specific animations, you may want to choose one over the other. For example, if you want to customize the touch feedback or add a custom animation, Pressable may be a better choice. On the other hand, if you want the default fade-out animation and automatic opacity change, TouchableOpacity may be a better choice.
