The Rule of 5 is not outdated, as there are still cases where you may need to define these special member functions. 

For example, if your class manages a resource that cannot be handled by a smart pointer, such as a file handle or a network socket, you will need to define a destructor to properly release the resource. Similarly, if your class has non-copyable or non-movable members, you will need to define the corresponding copy or move constructor/assignment operator to properly handle those members.

While it is true that smart pointers can often be used to manage resources, they may not always be the best solution. Smart pointers can add overhead and complexity to your code, and may not be appropriate for certain situations. Additionally, using smart pointers does not necessarily eliminate the need for defining copy/move constructors/assignment operators, as the behavior of smart pointers may not always be what you want.

In summary, while the Rule of 5 may not apply to all classes, it is still an important concept to understand and apply when necessary.
