You can use `grep` with a regular expression to match the `lang` attribute and extract its value. Here's an example command that should work for both cases:

```
curl -Ls yahoo.com | grep -oP 'lang="\K[^"]+' | head -1
```

This command uses the `-o` option to output only the matching part of the line, and the `-P` option to enable Perl-compatible regular expressions. The regular expression `lang="\K[^"]+` matches the `lang` attribute followed by a double quote, then uses `\K` to reset the match so that only the attribute value is captured. The `[^"]+` part matches one or more characters that are not a double quote, which should be the language code.

Note that this command assumes that the `lang` attribute is always enclosed in double quotes. If the HTML code uses single quotes instead, you'll need to modify the regular expression accordingly.
