It seems that there is a conflict between the version of Hibernate Validator that is included in your Spring Boot parent pom and the version that is resolved by Maven. 

You can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from your Spring Boot parent pom and explicitly include the version that you want to use in your project. 

To do this, add the following exclusion to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

Then, add the following dependency to explicitly include the version of Hibernate Validator that you want to use:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

After making these changes, try running your application again and see if the issue is resolved.
