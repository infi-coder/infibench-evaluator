The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

```bash
pip install zlib
```

If that doesn't work, you can try installing Pillow using pre-built binaries instead of building from source. You can download the appropriate version of Pillow from the following link:

https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pillow

Make sure to download the version that matches your Python version and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). Once downloaded, you can install Pillow by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

```bash
pip install path/to/Pillow.whl
```

Replace `path/to/Pillow.whl` with the actual path to the downloaded file.
