Yes, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to retrieve the description of a Windows Service. Here's an example:

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description | Out-GridView
```

This will display the name, display name, and description of all Windows Services in a grid view. You can modify the `Select-Object` statement to include or exclude additional properties as needed.
