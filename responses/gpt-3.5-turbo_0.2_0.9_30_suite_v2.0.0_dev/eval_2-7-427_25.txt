For the first question, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server's clock is not synchronized with the client's clock, causing the token to expire before it should. Another possibility is that the session cookie is not being sent or is being overwritten by another cookie. You can try setting the `SESSION_DOMAIN` variable in the `.env` file to the domain of your website to ensure that the session cookie is only sent to your website.

For the second question, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used by the server is not compatible with the SSL version being used by the client. You can try changing the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` value to `tls` instead of `ssl` and see if that works. If not, you may need to contact the email provider to find out what SSL version they support and adjust your configuration accordingly.
