To define an array of objects with a specific structure, you can use an interface. Here's an example of how you can define an interface for the objects in the array:

```typescript
interface Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}
```

Then, you can use this interface to define the type of the `products` parameter in your function:

```typescript
bagTotal = (products: Product[]) => {
  // function does stuff
}
```

This will ensure that the `products` parameter is an array of objects that have the `name`, `price`, and `description` properties with the correct types.
