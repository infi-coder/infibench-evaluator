The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is because the executable file was built on a Windows platform and is not compatible with the Linux environment in which AWS Lambda runs.

To resolve this issue, you need to build the executable file on a Linux environment or use a tool like `GOOS=linux go build main.go` to build the executable file for the Linux environment.

Here are the steps to build and deploy a Go AWS Lambda function on a Linux environment:

1. Install Go on a Linux machine or use a Linux virtual machine.
2. Write your Go code and save it as `main.go`.
3. Build the executable file for the Linux environment using the following command: `GOOS=linux go build main.go`.
4. Zip the executable file using the following command: `zip main.zip main`.
5. Upload the `main.zip` file to your AWS Lambda function using the AWS console or AWS CLI.
6. Test your Lambda function.

After following these steps, your Lambda function should be able to find and execute the `main` executable file in the `/var/task` directory.
