It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is present in the module cache on computer B. You can find the module cache location by running `go env GOMODCACHE`. If the module is not present, try running `go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` to download it.

2. Check if the module is accessible from computer B. Try running `git clone https://github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client.git` on computer B to see if you can access the repository.

3. Check if the module version `v0.1.5` exists. You can check this by going to the repository on GitHub and looking for the tag `v0.1.5`.

4. Check if the module is using the correct version control system. Go modules support Git, Mercurial, and Subversion. If the module is using a different version control system, it may not be downloaded correctly.

5. Check if the module is using the correct module path. Go modules use the module path to identify the module. If the module is using a different module path, it may not be downloaded correctly.

6. Check if the module is using the correct module version. If the module is using a different version than what is specified in the `go.mod` file, it may not be downloaded correctly.

7. Check if there are any network issues on computer B that may be preventing the module from being downloaded. Try running `ping github.ibm.com` to see if you can reach the server.

I hope these steps help you debug the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions!
