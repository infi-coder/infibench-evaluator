The error message suggests that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is likely because the executable file was not properly packaged in the ZIP file that was uploaded to AWS Lambda.

To properly package the executable file, you can follow these steps:

1. Build the executable file for Linux platform using the following command:

   ```
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o main main.go
   ```

   This will create a Linux executable file named `main` in the same directory.

2. Create a ZIP file that includes the `main` executable file using the following command:

   ```
   zip main.zip main
   ```

   This will create a ZIP file named `main.zip` that includes the `main` executable file.

3. Upload the `main.zip` file to AWS Lambda and set the handler to `main`.

   When you upload the ZIP file to AWS Lambda, make sure to set the handler to `main`. This tells AWS Lambda to look for the `main` executable file in the ZIP file.

After following these steps, you should be able to run the Lambda function without any errors.
