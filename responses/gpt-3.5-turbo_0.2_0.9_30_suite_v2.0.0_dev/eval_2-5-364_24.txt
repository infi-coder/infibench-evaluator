You can specify the Java version to be used by the Maven wrapper by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. 

First, find the path to the Java installation that works with the Maven task. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
mvn -version
```

This will output information about the Maven installation, including the path to the Java installation.

Next, set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to this path. For example, if the path to the Java installation is `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` variable by running the following command:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
```

Once you have set the `JAVA_HOME` variable, you can run the Maven wrapper as usual:

```
./mvnw clean install
```

This should use the specified version of Java.
