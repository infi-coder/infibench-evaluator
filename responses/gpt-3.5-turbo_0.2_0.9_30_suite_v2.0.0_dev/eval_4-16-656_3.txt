Yes, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to retrieve the detailed description of a Windows Service. Here's an example:

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description | Out-GridView
```

This will display a grid view with the Name, DisplayName, and Description properties of all Windows Services on the system. You can also filter the results by specifying the name of a specific service:

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service -Filter "Name='ServiceName'" | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description
```

Just replace "ServiceName" with the name of the service you want to retrieve the description for.
