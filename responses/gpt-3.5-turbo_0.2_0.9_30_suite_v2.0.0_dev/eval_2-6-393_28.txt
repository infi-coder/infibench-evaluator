The error message indicates that you cannot use the `Gender` property as a regular property on the `User` entity because it is already configured as a navigation property. 

To fix this issue, you can remove the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` from your `OnModelCreating` method. This line is not necessary since you already have a foreign key relationship between `User` and `Gender`. 

After removing the line, run the `dotnet ef add migration User` command again to generate a new migration.
