It seems like the issue is with the way you are starting the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` which means it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0` which will make it accessible from any IP address.

To do this, you need to modify the `server.host` option in your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  server: {
    port: 8080,
    host: '0.0.0.0'
  }
})
```

With this configuration, Vite will bind to `0.0.0.0` which will allow it to be accessible from outside the container.

After making this change, you can rebuild your Docker image and run the container again. Then try accessing it from your host machine using `localhost:8080` and it should work.
