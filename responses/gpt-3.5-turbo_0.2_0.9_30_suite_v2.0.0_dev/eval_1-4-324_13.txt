You can use the `tidyr` package in R to separate the `col1` column into separate columns based on the comma and colon separators. Here's the code for the `mySplit` function:

```r
library(tidyr)

mySplit <- function(df) {
  df %>%
    separate(col1, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = ",|:") %>%
    select(name, Age, City)
}
```

In this function, we first load the `tidyr` package. Then, we use the `%>%` operator to pipe the `df` data frame into the `separate()` function. 

The `separate()` function takes three arguments: the column to separate (`col1`), the names of the new columns (`name`, `Age`, and `City`), and the separator to use (`","` or `":"`). 

Finally, we use the `select()` function to reorder the columns in the resulting data frame. 

You can call this function by passing your data frame `df` as an argument, like this:

```r
result <- mySplit(df)
```

This will return a new data frame with the columns `name`, `Age`, and `City` separated out.
