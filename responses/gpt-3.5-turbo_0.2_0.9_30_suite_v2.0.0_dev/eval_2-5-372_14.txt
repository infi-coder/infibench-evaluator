It seems that there might be a conflict between the version of Hibernate Validator that is included in your project and the one that is being used by JBoss. 

You can try excluding the Hibernate Validator dependency from your project and let JBoss use its own version. To do this, add the following exclusion to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

This will exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from the spring-boot-starter-validation dependency. 

Alternatively, you can try upgrading the version of Hibernate Validator in your project to match the one used by JBoss. You can do this by adding the following dependency to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.5.Final-redhat-2</version>
</dependency>
```

Make sure to exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from the spring-boot-starter-validation dependency as shown above. 

After making these changes, try running your project again and see if the issue is resolved.
