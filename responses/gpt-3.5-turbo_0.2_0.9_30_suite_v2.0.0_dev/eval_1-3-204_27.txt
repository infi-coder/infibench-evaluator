The `rename()` method in Pandas is used to rename the axis labels of the DataFrame. It does not accept the `columns` parameter. To rename a specific column, you can use the `rename()` method on the Series object of that column.

Here's the modified code to rename the "p" column as "mean" and get the average numbers group by "t" column:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().rename("mean")
    df["mean"] = avg
    df.drop("p", axis=1, inplace=True)
    return df
```

In this code, we first group the DataFrame by "t" column and calculate the mean of "p" column. Then we rename the resulting Series object as "mean". Finally, we add a new column to the DataFrame with the values of the "mean" Series and drop the "p" column.
