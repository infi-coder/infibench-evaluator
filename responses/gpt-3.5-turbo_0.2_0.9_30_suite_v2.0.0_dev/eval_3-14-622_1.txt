To conform to the ShapeStyle protocol, you need to define a struct that conforms to the protocol and implement the required methods. Here's an example:

```
struct RedStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some Shape {
        Circle()
            .fill(Color.red)
    }
}

struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedStyle())
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a `RedStyle` struct that conforms to the `ShapeStyle` protocol. We implement the required `makeBody` method, which returns a `Shape` that fills a circle with the color red. Then, in `MyContentView`, we use `RedStyle` to fill the circle.
