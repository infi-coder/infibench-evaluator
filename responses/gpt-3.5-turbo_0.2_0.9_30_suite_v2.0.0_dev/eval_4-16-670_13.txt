Yes, you can convert your `id_rsa` OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Run the following command to convert your `id_rsa` file to an RSA private key:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   This command will prompt you to enter a new passphrase for the key (if you want to change it) and then convert the key to the PEM format with the RSA header.

3. If you want to keep using the same public key (`id_rsa.pub`), you don't need to transfer it. The public key is derived from the private key and will still work with the new RSA private key.

Note: It's always a good idea to backup your original `id_rsa` file before making any changes.
