You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after` pseudo-element and setting its `border-color` property to green. Here's an example CSS code:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    border-color: green;
}
```

Make sure to add this CSS code after the Bootstrap CSS file is loaded, so that it overrides the default styles.
