The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for installing Pillow. 

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Install zlib development libraries:

   On Windows, you can download the pre-built zlib binaries from the GnuWin32 project website: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/zlib.htm. After downloading, extract the files and add the `bin` directory to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

   On Linux, you can install zlib development libraries using the package manager of your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev`.

2. Re-run the Pillow installation command:

   After installing the zlib development libraries, try re-running the Pillow installation command using pip: `pip install pillow`.

If the above steps do not work, you can also try installing Pillow using a pre-built binary wheel file. You can download the appropriate wheel file for your system from the PyPI website: https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/#files. After downloading, install the wheel file using pip: `pip install <path-to-wheel-file>`.

I hope this helps!
