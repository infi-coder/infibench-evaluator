Your code looks correct. However, if the user denies permission to access their location, the `getCurrentPosition` method will not execute the success callback function. Therefore, you need to add an error callback function to handle this case. Here is the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this revised code, if the user denies permission to access their location, the error callback function will be executed and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console.
