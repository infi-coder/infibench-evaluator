It seems like the Dockerfile is unable to find the `app` module. You can try changing the `COPY` command to include the parent directory of the `app` module. 

Here's an updated Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /
RUN pip install --requirement /requirements.txt

COPY . /app

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

In this updated Dockerfile, we are copying the entire project directory to the `/app` directory in the container. This should include the `app` module and its dependencies. 

Let me know if this helps!
