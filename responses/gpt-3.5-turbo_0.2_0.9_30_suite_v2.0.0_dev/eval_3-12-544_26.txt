The error message suggests that the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` method is returning null. This can happen if the path_provider package is not properly initialized.

Make sure that you have added the path_provider package to your pubspec.yaml file and have run `flutter pub get` to install it.

Also, try adding the following import statement at the top of your file:
```dart
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
```

If the issue persists, try running `flutter clean` and then rebuild your project.
