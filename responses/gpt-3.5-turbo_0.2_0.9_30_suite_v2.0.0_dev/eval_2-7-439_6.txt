The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed on your server by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -m | grep zip
   ```

   If the extension is already installed, you should see `zip` in the list of installed modules.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The method for doing so depends on your server's operating system and PHP version. Here are some examples:

   - For Ubuntu with PHP 7.4, you can install the extension by running:

     ```
     sudo apt-get install php7.4-zip
     ```

   - For CentOS with PHP 7.4, you can install the extension by running:

     ```
     sudo yum install php74-php-zip
     ```

   - For macOS with PHP 7.4 installed via Homebrew, you can install the extension by running:

     ```
     brew install php@7.4
     brew install php@7.4-zip
     ```

3. Once the extension is installed, restart your web server or PHP-FPM service to apply the changes.

After installing the extension, you should be able to use the `zip` functions in your PHP code without any issues.
