The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib first and then installing Pillow again. 

On Windows, you can install zlib using the following steps:

1. Download the pre-built zlib binaries from the official website: https://www.zlib.net/
2. Extract the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.
3. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.
4. Run the following command to install zlib:

   ```
   mingw32-make -f win32/Makefile.gcc PREFIX=/mingw install
   ```

   Note: If you don't have mingw32-make installed, you can install it using the following command:

   ```
   pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-make
   ```

5. After installing zlib, try installing Pillow again using pip:

   ```
   pip install pillow
   ```

If the above steps don't work, you can try installing Pillow using a pre-built binary wheel file. You can download the appropriate wheel file for your system from the following website: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pillow

After downloading the wheel file, open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is located. Then, run the following command to install Pillow:

```
pip install <wheel_file_name>.whl
```

Replace `<wheel_file_name>` with the actual name of the wheel file you downloaded.
