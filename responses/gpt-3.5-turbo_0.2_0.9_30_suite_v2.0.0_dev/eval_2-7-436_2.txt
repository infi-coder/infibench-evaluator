It seems like Laravel 9 requires a higher version of PHP than the one you have installed. Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your current PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -v
```

If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you will need to upgrade your PHP version before installing Laravel 9. You can follow the instructions on the official PHP website to upgrade your PHP version.

Once you have upgraded your PHP version, you can try running the `composer create-project` command again to install Laravel 9.
