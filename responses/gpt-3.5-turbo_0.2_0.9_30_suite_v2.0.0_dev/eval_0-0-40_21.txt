The error message you are seeing indicates that there is a problem with the npm executable file. It seems like the file has Windows line endings, which is causing the issue.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the npm executable file is located. In your case, it is located in `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/`.

2. Run the following command to convert the line endings of the file to Unix format:

   ```
   sed -i 's/\r$//' npm
   ```

   This command will remove the Windows line endings from the file.

3. Make sure that the npm file has executable permissions. You can set the executable permission by running the following command:

   ```
   chmod +x npm
   ```

4. Try running the `npm -v` command again. It should work now.

If the above steps do not work, you can try reinstalling nodejs and npm using the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get remove nodejs
sudo apt-get remove npm
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

This will remove the existing installation of nodejs and npm and install the latest version of both packages.
