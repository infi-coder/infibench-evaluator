The error occurs because some of the values in the "year" column are in float format with a decimal point. To convert them to int, we need to remove the decimal point first. Here is the modified code:

```python
data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(str).str.split('.').str[0].astype(int)
```

This code first converts the "year" column to string format, then splits the string at the decimal point and keeps only the first part, which is the integer part. Finally, it converts the result to int format.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(str).str.split('.').str[0].astype(int)
    return data_h_df
``` 

You can call this function with your dataframe as argument to get the transformed dataframe.
