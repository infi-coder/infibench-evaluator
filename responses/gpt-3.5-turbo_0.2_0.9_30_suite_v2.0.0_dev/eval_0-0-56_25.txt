It seems like the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost`, which means it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0`, which will allow it to listen on all available network interfaces.

To do this, you can modify the `server.host` option in your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  server: {
    port: 8080,
    host: '0.0.0.0'
  }
})
```

This will make the Vite server accessible from outside the container.

Additionally, you may need to modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to use the `host` network mode, which will allow the container to use the host's network stack:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  app:
    image: myapp
    build: .
    container_name: myapp
    network_mode: host
```

With these changes, you should be able to access the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.
