@Configuration should be used when defining beans that require additional configuration beyond what can be provided by the other annotations. This includes defining complex beans, configuring third-party libraries, and creating custom configuration classes. @Service, @Controller, and @Component are used for defining beans that provide specific functionality within the application.
