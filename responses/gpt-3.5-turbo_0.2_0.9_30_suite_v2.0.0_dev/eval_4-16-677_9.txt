The issue with your script is that you are using single quotes around the `$searchT` variable in the `grep` command. Single quotes prevent variable expansion, so the `$searchT` variable is not being replaced with its value.

To fix this, you can use double quotes instead of single quotes around the `grep` command. This will allow the `$searchT` variable to be expanded.

Here's the updated script:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if grep -wi "$searchT" test.txt; then     
    echo "$(grep "$searchT" test.txt | wc -l) number of matches found"
    grep "$searchT" test.txt
else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

In this updated script, we have removed the `cat` command and used the `grep` command directly on the file. We have also removed the unnecessary `echo` command and used the `grep` command directly in the `if` statement.

Now, the script should run correctly and output the number of matches found if the `if` statement is true.
