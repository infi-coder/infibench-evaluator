The issue with your code is that the `rename()` method is not applicable to a Pandas Series object, which is what you get when you call `.mean()` on a DataFrame column. Instead, you can use the `agg()` method to apply multiple aggregation functions to a DataFrame column and then rename the resulting columns.

Here's the modified code that should work:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].agg(mean=("p", "mean"))
    avg = avg.rename(columns={"mean": "p_mean"})
    return avg
```

In this code, we first group the DataFrame by the "t" column and apply the "mean" aggregation function to the "p" column using the `agg()` method. This creates a new DataFrame with a single column named "mean". We then rename this column to "p_mean" using the `rename()` method and return the resulting DataFrame.

Note that I've also modified the function signature to take in the `df` argument, which is not used in your original code. You can pass in any DataFrame to this function and it will perform the required operations on it.
