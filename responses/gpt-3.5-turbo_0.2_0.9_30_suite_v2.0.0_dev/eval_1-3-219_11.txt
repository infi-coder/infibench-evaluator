Here are a few things you can try to solve the issue:

1. Make sure that the Jupyter package is installed in your virtual environment "da38". You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   conda install jupyter
   ```

2. Try launching Jupyter notebook outside of VS Code to see if it works. Open your terminal and activate your virtual environment "da38" by running:

   ```
   conda activate da38
   ```

   Then, run the following command to launch Jupyter notebook:

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   If Jupyter notebook launches successfully, it means that the issue is with VS Code and not with Jupyter itself.

3. Check if the Python extension is up to date in VS Code. You can do this by going to the Extensions tab on the left-hand side of VS Code and searching for "Python". If there is an update available, click on the "Update" button.

4. Try resetting the Python extension settings in VS Code. Go to the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows, Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) and search for "Python: Reset Extension Settings". Select this option and restart VS Code.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try uninstalling and reinstalling both VS Code and Miniconda. Make sure to delete any leftover files and folders before reinstalling.
