The issue you are experiencing may be due to a compatibility issue between the Selenium VBA library and Excel 2019. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that the Selenium VBA library is properly installed and referenced in your Excel 2019 workbook. You can do this by going to the VBA editor, selecting "Tools" > "References", and ensuring that the "Selenium Type Library" is checked.

2. Try using a different browser driver. For example, instead of using the "ie" driver, try using the "chrome" driver or the "firefox" driver. You can download these drivers from the Selenium website.

3. Check if there are any updates available for the Selenium VBA library. You can do this by visiting the Selenium VBA GitHub page and checking for any updates or bug fixes.

4. Try running the code on a different machine with Excel 2019 installed to see if the issue is specific to your machine.

5. If none of the above steps work, you may need to consider using a different automation tool or contacting the Selenium VBA support team for further assistance.
