Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Run the following command to convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   This command will prompt you to enter a passphrase for your private key. If you didn't set a passphrase when you created the key, you can just press Enter to continue.

3. After you enter the passphrase (if required), the command will convert your key and save it as `id_rsa` in the PEM format.

4. You can verify that the key has been converted by checking the header of the file. It should now start with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

5. You don't need to transfer your `id_rsa.pub` file, as it is just the public key that corresponds to your private key. The server administrator should already have this file.

Note: It's always a good idea to make a backup of your original key before making any changes. You can do this by copying the `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` files to a safe location before running the `ssh-keygen` command.
