To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to do the following steps:

1. Update your project to use Android Studio 4.2 or later.
2. Add the following dependencies to your app-level build.gradle file:

```
android {
    ...
    buildFeatures {
        compose true
    }
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:1.0.0"
    ...
}
```

3. Sync your project with Gradle.
4. Create a Composable function in your project and start using Jetpack Compose.

That's it! You can now use Jetpack Compose in your existing Android Studio project.
