Yes, you can use the `date_range` function in Pandas to create a range of dates for the entire year and then calculate the length of the range. Here's an example function `DaysInYear` that takes a year as an argument and returns the number of days in that year:

```python
import pandas as pd

def DaysInYear(year):
    start_date = pd.to_datetime(f"{year}-01-01")
    end_date = pd.to_datetime(f"{year}-12-31")
    days_in_year = len(pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date))
    return days_in_year
```

This function first creates a `start_date` and `end_date` using the `to_datetime` function in Pandas. It then creates a range of dates using `date_range` and calculates the length of the range using `len`. Finally, it returns the number of days in the year. 

You can call this function with a year as an argument to get the number of days in that year. For example:

```python
>>> DaysInYear(2020)
366
>>> DaysInYear(2019)
365
```
