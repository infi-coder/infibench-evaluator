Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly indicates that the class has a dependency on another class and that dependency is injected through the constructor. It also ensures that the dependency is mandatory and must be provided at the time of object creation. This helps in avoiding NullPointerExceptions and other runtime errors. Additionally, it makes the class more testable as you can easily mock the dependency while writing unit tests. However, if you are using Spring 4.3 or later, you can omit the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor as Spring will automatically detect the constructor and inject the dependencies.
