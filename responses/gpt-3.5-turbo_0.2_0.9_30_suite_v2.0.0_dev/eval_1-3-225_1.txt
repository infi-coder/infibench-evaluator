Here's the revised code for the `pig_latin` function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
  words = text.split()
  pig_words = []
  for word in words:
    endString = word[1:].lower()
    startString = word[0].lower()
    pig_word = endString + startString + 'ay'
    pig_words.append(pig_word)
  return ' '.join(pig_words)
```

The problem with the original code is that the `return` statement is inside the `for` loop, so it returns the first word after the first iteration. Also, the `them` variable is unnecessary and the capitalization of the second letter is incorrect. The revised code creates an empty list `pig_words` to store the pig Latin words, loops through each word in `words`, and creates a new pig Latin word by slicing the original word and concatenating the end string, start string, and "ay". The pig Latin word is then appended to `pig_words`. Finally, the function returns the joined `pig_words` with a space separator.
