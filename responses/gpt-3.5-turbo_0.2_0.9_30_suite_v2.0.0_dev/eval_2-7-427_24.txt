For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server's clock is not synchronized with the client's clock, causing the token to expire before it is used. Another possibility is that the session is not being properly maintained on the server, causing the token to be lost or regenerated. You can try increasing the SESSION_LIFETIME to a higher value and see if that resolves the issue. Additionally, you can check if the server's timezone is set correctly.

For the second issue, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used by the server is not compatible with the SSL version being used by the client. You can try changing the encryption method to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' in your .env file and see if that resolves the issue. Additionally, you can try changing the port to 465, which is the default port for SSL/TLS encrypted connections. If that doesn't work, you can try contacting the email provider to see if they have any specific requirements for connecting to their SMTP server.
