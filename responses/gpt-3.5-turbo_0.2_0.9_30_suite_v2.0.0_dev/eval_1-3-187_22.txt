You can use list slicing and list comprehension to achieve this. Here's the implementation of the `ReplaceElementsByIndex` function:

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    # Replace the first 4 elements in b with the elements in rest
    b[:4] = rest
    
    # Replace the elements in last according to the matches with b to get the rest elements
    replaced_last = [rest[b.index(i)] if i in b else i for i in last]
    
    return replaced_last
```

Here's how you can use this function:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

replaced_last = ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last)
print(replaced_last)
```

Output:
```
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```
