There are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Make sure that the `@EnableSwagger2WebMvc` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application configuration class.

2. Check that the `@ComponentScan` annotation in your application configuration class includes the package where your Swagger configuration class is located.

3. Verify that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` property is set correctly in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. By default, it should be set to `/swagger-ui.html`.

4. Check that the `@OpenAPIDefinition` annotation is present in your Swagger configuration class, and that it includes the correct information about your API.

5. Verify that the `@Bean` annotation is present in your Swagger configuration class, and that it creates a `Docket` bean with the correct configuration.

If none of these steps solve the issue, you can try adding the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.webjars</groupId>
    <artifactId>swagger-ui</artifactId>
    <version>3.52.0</version>
</dependency>
```

This will include the Swagger UI files in your application, and you can access it at `localhost:8080/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html`.
