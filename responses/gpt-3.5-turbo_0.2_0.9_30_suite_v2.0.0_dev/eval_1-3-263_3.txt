The "f" in `print(f"...")` stands for "formatted string literals" in Python. It is a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`. 

In your example, the expressions inside the curly braces are `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory`. These expressions are evaluated and their values are inserted into the string at runtime. This makes it easier to create dynamic strings that include variables or other expressions.

For example, instead of concatenating strings and variables using the `+` operator, you can use formatted string literals like this:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

This will output: `My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.`
