The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is an extension that needs to be installed on your server or local machine.

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow the steps below:

1. Find out which version of PHP you are using by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -v
   ```

2. Install the `zip` extension for your version of PHP. For example, if you are using PHP 7.4 on Ubuntu, you can install the extension by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install php7.4-zip
   ```

3. Once the extension is installed, restart your web server or PHP-FPM service. For example, if you are using Apache, you can restart it by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo service apache2 restart
   ```

After completing these steps, you should be able to use the `zip` extension in your PHP code.
