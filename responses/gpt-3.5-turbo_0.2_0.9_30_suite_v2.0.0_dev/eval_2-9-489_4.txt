2. Add the following lines to the bottom of the file:

xpack.security.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning should disappear. If you still see the warning, make sure that you have the latest version of Elasticsearch installed and that you have followed the instructions in the link provided in the warning message.
