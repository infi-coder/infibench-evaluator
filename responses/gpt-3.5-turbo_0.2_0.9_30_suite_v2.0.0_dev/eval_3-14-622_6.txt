To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to define a `fill` method that takes a `ContentShape` and returns a `some View`. Here's an example implementation that uses `Color` as the fill style:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func fill<S>(_ shape: S) -> some View where S : Shape {
        shape.fill(Color.red)
    }
}
```

Then you can use `RedView()` as the fill style for your `Circle`:

```
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedView())
    }
}
```
