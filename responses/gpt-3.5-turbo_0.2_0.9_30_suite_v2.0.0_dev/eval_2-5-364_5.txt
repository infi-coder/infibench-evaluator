You can specify the path to the Java executable that you want to use by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. 

To do this, you can follow these steps:

1. Determine the path to the Java executable that you want to use. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   which java
   ```

   This will output the path to the Java executable that is currently being used.

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of the Java executable that you want to use. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/java` with the path to the Java executable that you want to use.

3. Run the Maven wrapper command as you normally would. Maven will now use the Java executable that you specified in the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

Alternatively, you can also set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in your system's environment variables. This will make it available to all terminal or command prompt sessions.
