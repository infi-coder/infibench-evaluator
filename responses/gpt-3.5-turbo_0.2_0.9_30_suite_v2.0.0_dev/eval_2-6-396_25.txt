The error message is indicating that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. In your case, you are trying to create an index on the `Gender` navigation property of the `User` entity.

To solve this problem, you can create an index on the `GenderId` property instead. Here's how you can modify your `OnModelCreating` method:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

This will create an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity, which should solve the problem.
