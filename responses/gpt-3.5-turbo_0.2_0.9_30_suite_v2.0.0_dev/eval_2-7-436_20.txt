The error message indicates that the version of PHP you are using is not compatible with Laravel 9. Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher.

You can check your current PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -v
```

If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you will need to upgrade your PHP version before installing Laravel 9.

Once you have upgraded your PHP version, you can try running the `composer create-project` command again to install Laravel 9.
