TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides utility classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. It doesn't provide a way to select elements using CSS selectors like `>`.

However, you can use the `@layer` directive in your CSS to define your own custom styles. Here's an example of how you can define a custom style to select the direct children of a `div` element with class `section`:

```css
@layer components {
  .section > * {
    /* Your styles here */
  }
}
```

This will select all direct children of a `div` element with class `section` and apply the styles you define inside the curly braces. You can then add the `section` class to your HTML element to apply this style:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div>Direct child 1</div>
  <div>Direct child 2</div>
</div>
``` 

Note that this approach requires you to define your own custom styles, which may not be as flexible as using CSS selectors directly.
