The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed on your server by running the following command in your terminal:
```
php -m | grep zip
```
If the extension is already installed, you should see `zip` in the list of installed modules.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The process for installing the extension varies depending on your operating system and web server. Here are some examples:

- For Ubuntu with Apache:
```
sudo apt-get install php-zip
sudo service apache2 restart
```

- For CentOS with Apache:
```
sudo yum install php-zip
sudo service httpd restart
```

- For macOS with Apache:
```
brew install php
brew install php-zip
sudo apachectl restart
```

3. After installing the extension, you should be able to run your PHP script without any issues.

Note: If you are using a different web server or operating system, you may need to adjust the installation steps accordingly.
