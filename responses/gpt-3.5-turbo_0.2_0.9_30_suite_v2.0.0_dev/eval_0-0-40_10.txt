It seems like there is an issue with the line endings in the `npm` file. You can fix this by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install dos2unix
sudo dos2unix /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm
```

This will install the `dos2unix` package and convert the line endings in the `npm` file to Unix format. After that, you should be able to run `npm -v` without any issues.
