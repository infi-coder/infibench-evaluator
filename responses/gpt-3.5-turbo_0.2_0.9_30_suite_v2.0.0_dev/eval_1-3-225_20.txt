Here's the revised code for the `pig_latin` function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
  words = text.split()
  pig_words = []
  for word in words:
    endString = word[1:].lower() + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
    pig_words.append(endString)
  return ' '.join(pig_words)
```

This code should work as expected. The changes made are:

- Instead of returning a single word at a time, we append each pig Latin word to a list `pig_words`.
- We use `word[1:].lower()` to get all the characters in the word except the first one, and convert them to lowercase.
- We use `word[0].lower()` to get the first character of the word, and convert it to lowercase.
- We append the string `'ay'` to the end of the modified word.
- We join all the pig Latin words in the list `pig_words` using a space separator, and return the resulting string.
