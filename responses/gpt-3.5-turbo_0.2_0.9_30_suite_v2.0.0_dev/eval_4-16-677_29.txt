You need to remove the single quotes around `$searchT` in the `if` statement. Single quotes prevent variable expansion, so `grep` is looking for the literal string `$searchT` instead of the value of the variable. Here's the corrected code:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

With this change, the script should correctly match the search term and output the number of matches and the matching lines if there are any, or "no match found" if there are no matches.
