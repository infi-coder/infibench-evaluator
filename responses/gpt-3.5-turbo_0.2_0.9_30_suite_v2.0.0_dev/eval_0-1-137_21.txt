The error is caused by the fact that you are missing a comma after the value of the "primary" color in your `$theme-colors` map. Here is the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here,
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace `#your-color-here` with the actual color value you want to use for the primary color.

Also, make sure that you have installed the required dependencies for compiling SASS. You can install them by running the following command:

```
npm install sass --save-dev
```

Then, you can compile your SCSS file to CSS by running the following command:

```
sass style.scss custom.css
```

This will compile your `style.scss` file to `custom.css` file.
