It seems like the package `aws-sdk-js` is not found in the npm registry. This could be due to a temporary issue with the registry or a typo in the package name. 

You can try running `npm cache clean` to clear the npm cache and then run `npm install` again. If that doesn't work, you can try installing a specific version of the package by running `npm install aws-sdk-js@<version>` where `<version>` is the version number you want to install. 

If the issue persists, you can check the npm registry status at https://status.npmjs.org/ to see if there are any ongoing issues.
