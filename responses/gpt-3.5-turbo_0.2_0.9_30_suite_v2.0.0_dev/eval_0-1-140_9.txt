With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for calling an icon has changed. You need to use the `font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"` or `font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Pro"` depending on the version you are using. Also, the content value should be the Unicode value of the icon, which you can find on the Font Awesome website.

Here's an example of how to update your code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

In this example, we're using the free version of Font Awesome 5, and the Unicode value for the icon is `\f107`. You can find the Unicode value for any icon on the Font Awesome website by clicking on the icon and looking for the value next to "Unicode".
