The error message "bad CPU type in executable" usually occurs when you are trying to run a binary that is not compatible with your CPU architecture. This error can occur if you are trying to run a 32-bit binary on a 64-bit system or vice versa.

In the case of pdftk, it is a 32-bit binary and it is not compatible with the latest version of MacOS Catalina which only supports 64-bit applications.

One solution to this problem is to use an alternative tool to pdftk that is compatible with 64-bit systems. Here are some alternatives:

1. PDFsam Basic: This is a free and open-source tool that can split, merge, and extract pages from PDF files.

2. Sejda PDF: This is a web-based tool that can perform various PDF operations such as merging, splitting, and compressing PDF files.

3. Adobe Acrobat Pro DC: This is a paid tool that can perform various PDF operations such as editing, converting, and signing PDF files.

If you still want to use pdftk, you can try installing an older version of MacOS that supports 32-bit applications or run pdftk in a virtual machine with an older version of MacOS.
