The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib first and then install Pillow again. Here are the steps to install zlib on Windows:

1. Download the pre-built binary for zlib from the GnuWin32 project: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/zlib.htm

2. Extract the downloaded file to a folder on your computer, for example, `C:\zlib`.

3. Add the `bin` folder of the extracted zlib to your system's PATH environment variable. To do this, follow these steps:

   a. Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables".
   
   b. Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
   
   c. Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
   
   d. Under "System Variables", scroll down and find the "Path" variable, then click "Edit".
   
   e. Click "New" and add the path to the `bin` folder of the extracted zlib, for example, `C:\zlib\bin`.
   
   f. Click "OK" to close all the windows.

4. Open a new command prompt and run `pip install pillow` again.

If the above steps do not work, you can try installing Pillow using a pre-built binary. You can download the appropriate binary for your Python version and operating system from the official Pillow website: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#binary-installation-on-windows.
