You can achieve this by using list indexing. Here is the implementation of the `ReplaceElementsByIndex` function:

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    for i in range(len(rest)):
        index = b.index(last[i])
        b[index] = rest[i]
        last[i] = rest[i]
    return last
```

Here, we are iterating over the elements of `rest` using a for loop. For each element, we are finding its index in `b` using the `index()` method. Then, we are replacing the element at that index in `b` with the corresponding element from `rest`. Finally, we are replacing the element at the same index in `last` with the corresponding element from `rest`.

You can call this function with your sample lists as follows:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

result = ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last)
print(result)
```

This will output:

```
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```
