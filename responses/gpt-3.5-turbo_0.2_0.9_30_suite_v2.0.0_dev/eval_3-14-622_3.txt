To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement the `fill` method that takes a `ContentShape` and returns a `some View`. Here's an example:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func fill<S>(_ shape: S) -> some View where S : Shape {
        Color.red
    }
}
```

Then you can use `RedView()` as the fill for your `Circle`:

```
Circle()
    .fill(RedView())
```
