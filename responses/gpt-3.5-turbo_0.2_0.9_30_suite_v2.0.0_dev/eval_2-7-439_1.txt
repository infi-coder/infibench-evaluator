The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed on your server by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -m | grep zip
   ```

   If the output contains `zip`, then the extension is already installed.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The installation process depends on your server's operating system. Here are the commands for some popular operating systems:

   - Ubuntu/Debian:

     ```
     sudo apt-get install php-zip
     ```

   - CentOS/Fedora:

     ```
     sudo yum install php-zip
     ```

   - macOS (with Homebrew):

     ```
     brew install php
     brew install php-zip
     ```

3. After installing the extension, restart your web server to apply the changes.

Once the `ext-zip` extension is installed on your server, you should be able to use it in your PHP code without any issues.
