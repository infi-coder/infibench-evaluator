The Rule of 5 is not outdated, as there are still cases where a user-defined constructor, destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment constructor, move constructor, or move assignment constructor is necessary. 

For example, if a class manages a resource that cannot be handled by a smart pointer, such as a file handle or a network connection, then a user-defined destructor is necessary to properly release that resource. Similarly, if a class has non-copyable or non-movable members, then a user-defined copy constructor, copy assignment constructor, move constructor, or move assignment constructor may be necessary to properly handle those members.

While it is true that smart pointers can often be used to manage resources, they are not always the best solution. Smart pointers can introduce overhead and may not be appropriate for all situations. Additionally, there may be cases where a class needs to manage multiple resources or have more complex resource management requirements that cannot be handled by a smart pointer alone.

In summary, while smart pointers can be a useful tool for managing resources, they are not always the best solution and there are still cases where a user-defined constructor, destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment constructor, move constructor, or move assignment constructor is necessary.
