When you set `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file, it means that the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your TypeScript code. 

Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. They are useful for debugging purposes, as they allow you to set breakpoints and step through your TypeScript code in the browser's developer tools.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the browser's developer tools will not be able to map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. This means that you will not be able to debug your TypeScript code in the browser's developer tools.

However, setting `"sourceMap": false` can have some benefits. Source maps can be quite large, and disabling them can reduce the size of your compiled JavaScript files. This can result in faster load times for your application.

Overall, whether or not to use source maps is a trade-off between debugging capabilities and file size. If you are actively developing and debugging your application, it is recommended to keep `"sourceMap": true`. If you are deploying your application to production, you may want to consider setting `"sourceMap": false` to reduce file size.
