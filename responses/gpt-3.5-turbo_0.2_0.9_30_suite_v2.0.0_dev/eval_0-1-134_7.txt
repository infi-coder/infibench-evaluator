It sounds like you might be referring to Emmet, a plugin for text editors that allows you to write HTML and CSS code using shorthand syntax. 

To use Emmet, you can type out the shorthand syntax and then press the "Tab" key to expand it into the full HTML or CSS code. For example, typing `.classname` and then pressing "Tab" should expand into `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, make sure that you have Emmet installed and enabled in your text editor. The specific steps for enabling Emmet will depend on the text editor you are using.
