The `FormatException` occurs when the JSON string is not properly formatted. In your case, it seems that the response body is not a valid JSON string. 

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Print the response body to see the actual content of the response. You can use `print(response.body)` to do this.

2. Check if the response body is a valid JSON string. You can use an online JSON validator to do this.

3. If the response body is not a valid JSON string, then you need to fix the PHP code that generates the response. Make sure that the response is a valid JSON string.

4. If the response body is a valid JSON string, then you need to check if the JSON string is properly formatted. You can use the `json.decode()` method to decode the JSON string. If the JSON string is not properly formatted, then the `json.decode()` method will throw a `FormatException`. In this case, you need to fix the JSON string.

5. If the JSON string is properly formatted, then the `json.decode()` method will return a `Map` or a `List` depending on the structure of the JSON string. You can then use this `Map` or `List` to extract the data that you need.

Hope this helps!
