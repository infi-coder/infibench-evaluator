You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate a Power Query. You can create a connection to the Power Query, refresh it, and then load the data to a worksheet. Here's an example code:

```
Sub RefreshPowerQuery()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Dim oledbConn As OLEDBConnection
    
    ' Get the connection to the Power Query
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections("Query - MyQueryName")
    Set oledbConn = conn.OLEDBConnection
    
    ' Refresh the query
    conn.Refresh
    
    ' Load the data to a worksheet
    With ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet2").ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:=oledbConn, Destination:=Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdSql
        .CommandText = oledbConn.CommandText
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With
End Sub
```

Replace "Query - MyQueryName" with the name of your Power Query connection, and "Sheet2" with the name of the worksheet where you want to load the data.
