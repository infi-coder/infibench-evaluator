You can use the `iter()` method to create an iterator over the vector and then use the `min()` method to get the minimum value. Here's an example:

```rust
let v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
let min_value = *v.iter().min().unwrap();
println!("Minimum value: {}", min_value);
```

The `iter()` method creates an iterator over the vector, and the `min()` method returns an `Option<&i32>` that contains the minimum value. The `unwrap()` method is used to extract the value from the `Option`. Finally, the `*` operator is used to dereference the value, since it is a reference to an `i32`.
