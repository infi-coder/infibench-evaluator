To disable the back button in Flutter when you have reached the login page after logging out, you can use the `WillPopScope` widget. Wrap your login page with `WillPopScope` and set its `onWillPop` property to return a `Future.value(false)`. This will prevent the user from going back to the previous page using the back button or the back gesture.

Here's an example:

```
WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () => Future.value(false),
  child: LoginPage(),
)
```

Note that this will only disable the back button for the current page. If you want to prevent the user from going back to the previous page even if they navigate away from the app and come back later, you will need to implement some sort of session management and redirect the user to the login page if they are not logged in.
