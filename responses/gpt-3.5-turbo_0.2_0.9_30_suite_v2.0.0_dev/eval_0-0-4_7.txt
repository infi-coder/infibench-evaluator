- Pressable and TouchableOpacity have the same basic functionalities. They both are for making a text/image clickable.

- Pressable has some new props, like `android_ripple` which you can use to define how far a touch can register away from the the wrapped element.

- On the other hand, TouchableOpacity also have some unique functionalities. For example, TouchableOpacity has automatic opacity change, where with Pressable you need to add your own custom opacity change with Pressable's `style` prop. Furthermore, TouchableOpacity adds the fade-out animation on press. 

So, if you need a simple clickable component, you can use either Pressable or TouchableOpacity. However, if you want to have an automatic opacity change and a fade-out animation on press, then TouchableOpacity is the better choice. If you need to customize the touch feedback, then Pressable is the way to go.
