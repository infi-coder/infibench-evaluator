Yes, you can use the `date_range` function in Pandas to create a range of dates for the given year and then calculate the length of the range to get the total number of days in the year. Here is an example function `DaysInYear` that takes a year as an argument and returns the total number of days in that year:

```python
import pandas as pd

def DaysInYear(year):
    start_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-01-01')
    end_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-12-31')
    days_in_year = len(pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date))
    return days_in_year
```

This function first creates a `start_date` and an `end_date` using the `to_datetime` function in Pandas. It then uses the `date_range` function to create a range of dates between the start and end dates, and calculates the length of the range to get the total number of days in the year.
