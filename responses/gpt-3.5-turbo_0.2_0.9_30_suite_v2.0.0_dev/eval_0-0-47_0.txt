You can define an interface for the object type you want to use in the array and then use that interface as the type for the array parameter. Here's an example:

```typescript
interface Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}

bagTotal = (products: Product[]) => {
  // function does stuff
}
```

This way, you can ensure that the `products` parameter is an array of objects that have the `name`, `price`, and `description` properties of the correct types.
