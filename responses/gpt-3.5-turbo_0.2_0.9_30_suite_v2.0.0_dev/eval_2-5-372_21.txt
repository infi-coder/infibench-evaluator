It seems that there is a version conflict between the Hibernate Validator version used by your Spring Boot application and the version resolved by Maven. 

Your application is using Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2, which is probably provided by JBoss, while Maven is resolving version 6.0.11. 

To solve this issue, you can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from the Spring Boot starter and add the desired version explicitly. Here's an example:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.5.Final-redhat-2</version>
</dependency>
```

This should ensure that your application uses the same version of Hibernate Validator as the one provided by JBoss.
