The issue with your code is that `rename()` method is used to rename the index or column labels, not the column values. To rename the column values, you can simply assign a new name to the column using the `df.columns` attribute. Here's the modified code that should work:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean()
    avg = avg.rename("mean").reset_index()
    df.columns = ["t", "mean", "x", "y", "z"]
    return df
```

In this code, we first group the DataFrame by "t" column and calculate the mean of "p" column. Then, we rename the resulting Series to "mean" and reset the index to convert it back to a DataFrame. Finally, we assign the new column names to the DataFrame using `df.columns` attribute.
