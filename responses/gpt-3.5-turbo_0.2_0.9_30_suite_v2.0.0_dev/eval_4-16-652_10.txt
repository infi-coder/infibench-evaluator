You can use the `--output` parameter to set the output format to `text` and then pipe the output to `/dev/null` to discard it. This will prevent the interactive pager from popping up and allow the `for` loop to continue to the next iteration without any manual intervention.

Here's an updated version of your bash script that implements this solution:

```
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo --output text >/dev/null; 
done
```

This will send the output of the AWS CLI command to `/dev/null`, which is a special file that discards all data written to it.
