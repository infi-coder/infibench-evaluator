You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after` pseudo-element in CSS and setting its `border-color` property to green. Here's an example:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    border-color: green;
}
```

You can add this CSS code to your stylesheet or add it to a `<style>` block in the `<head>` section of your HTML document.
