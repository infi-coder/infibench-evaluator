Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Run the following command to convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key:
```
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
3. You will be prompted to enter a passphrase for your private key. If you didn't set a passphrase when you created the key, just press Enter.
4. After you enter the passphrase (or press Enter), the key will be converted to RSA format and saved to `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (the same file as before).
5. You can verify that the key has been converted by checking the header of the file. It should now start with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

As for your second question, you don't need to transfer your `id_rsa.pub` file. This file contains your public key, which is used by the server to authenticate you. The format of the public key doesn't matter as long as it matches the private key. Since you're only converting the private key, you can continue to use the same `id_rsa.pub` file.
