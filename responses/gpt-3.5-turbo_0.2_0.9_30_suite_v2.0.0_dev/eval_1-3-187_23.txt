You can use list slicing to replace the first 4 elements of b with the elements in rest. Then, you can iterate over the elements in last and replace them with the corresponding element from rest if it exists in b.

Here's the implementation of the `ReplaceElementsByIndex` function:

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    b[:4] = rest
    for i in range(len(last)):
        if last[i] in b:
            last[i] = rest[b.index(last[i])]
    return last
```

Here's how you can use the function:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

replaced_list = ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last)
print(replaced_list)  # Output: [11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

The output is the replaced list as expected.
