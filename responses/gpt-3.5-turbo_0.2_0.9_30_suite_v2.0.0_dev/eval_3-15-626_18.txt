You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate Power Query. Here's an example code snippet:

```
Sub RefreshPowerQuery()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections("Query - MyQueryName")
    conn.Refresh
End Sub
```

Replace "Query - MyQueryName" with the name of your Power Query. You can also use `conn.OLEDBConnection.CommandText` to modify the query before refreshing.
