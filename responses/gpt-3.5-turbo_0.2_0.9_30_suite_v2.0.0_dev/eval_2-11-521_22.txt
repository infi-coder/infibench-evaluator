Yes, the above comment is true/correct. 

In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special method that is automatically invoked when an object is created. It is responsible for initializing the object's state and preparing it for use. 

Unlike regular methods, constructors cannot be called directly like a function. Instead, they are invoked automatically when a new object is created using the `new` keyword. 

Therefore, the statement "A constructor cannot be called, it is not a function. It is invoked automatically when a new object is created" is accurate.
