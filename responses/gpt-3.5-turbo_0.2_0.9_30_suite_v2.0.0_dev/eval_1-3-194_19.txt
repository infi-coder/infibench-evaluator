To write a list of lists into an Excel file using Python, we can use the `openpyxl` library. Here's the implementation of the `writeExcel()` function:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeExcel():
    # create a new workbook
    wb = openpyxl.Workbook()

    # select the active worksheet
    ws = wb.active

    # create the list of lists
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

    # write the list of lists to the worksheet
    for row in new_list:
        ws.append(row)

    # save the workbook
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new workbook using the `openpyxl.Workbook()` method, selects the active worksheet using the `wb.active` attribute, and writes the list of lists to the worksheet using a `for` loop and the `ws.append()` method. Finally, the workbook is saved using the `wb.save()` method with the filename "data.xlsx".
