It seems that the Dockerfile is unable to find the `app` module. You can try modifying the `COPY` command to include the parent directory of the `app` module. Here's an updated version of the Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /
RUN pip install --requirement /requirements.txt

COPY ./fastapi /app

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

In this version, we are copying the `fastapi` directory instead of the `app` directory. This should include the `app` module as a subdirectory. Then, when running the `uvicorn` command, we specify `app.main:app` to indicate that the `app` module is located within the `main` module.
