The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib first and then installing Pillow again. 

On Windows, you can download the pre-built binaries for zlib from the GnuWin32 project website (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/zlib.htm). After downloading, extract the files and add the bin directory to your system PATH environment variable.

Then, try installing Pillow again using pip:

```
pip install pillow
```

If that doesn't work, you can try installing Pillow from a wheel file. Download the appropriate wheel file for your system from https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/#files and install it using pip:

```
pip install path/to/Pillow-<version>-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
```

Replace `<version>` with the version number of the wheel file you downloaded.
