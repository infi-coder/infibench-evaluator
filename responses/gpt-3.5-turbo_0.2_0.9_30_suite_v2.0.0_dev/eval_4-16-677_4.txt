In your `if` statement, you are using single quotes around `$searchT`. Single quotes prevent variable expansion, so `$searchT` is not being replaced with the user input. To fix this, you can use double quotes instead of single quotes. Here's the corrected code:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

With this change, the script should now correctly match the user input against the contents of `test.txt`.
