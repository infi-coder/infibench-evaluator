TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides classes that can be used to style HTML elements. In order to select the direct children of a div with class "section" using TailwindCSS, you can use the `>` (direct child) selector in combination with the `class` utility.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="child">Child 1</div>
  <div class="child">Child 2</div>
  <div class="child">Child 3</div>
</div>
```

To select the direct children of the div with class "section", you can use the following TailwindCSS classes:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="class:child">Child 1</div>
  <div class="class:child">Child 2</div>
  <div class="class:child">Child 3</div>
</div>
```

In this example, the `class:child` utility is used to select the direct children of the div with class "section". This will apply the styles defined for the `.child` class to all direct children of the div with class "section".
