Sure! The correct definition of `FruitsAndColors` would be:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This creates an intersection type using the `&` operator, combining two separate mapped types. The first mapped type maps each `fruit` to a `number`, and the second mapped type maps each `color` to a `boolean`. By using the `&` operator, we combine these two mapped types into a single type that has both the numeric properties for each fruit and the boolean properties for each color.
