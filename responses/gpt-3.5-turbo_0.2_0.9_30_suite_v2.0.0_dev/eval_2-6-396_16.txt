The error message is caused by the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` in your `OnModelCreating` method. You are trying to create an index on the `Gender` property, which is actually a navigation property to the `Gender` entity.

To fix the error, you should remove the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` and instead create an index on the `GenderId` property, which is the foreign key to the `Gender` entity. Here's the updated `OnModelCreating` method:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

With this change, you should be able to run `dotnet ef add migration User` without any errors.
