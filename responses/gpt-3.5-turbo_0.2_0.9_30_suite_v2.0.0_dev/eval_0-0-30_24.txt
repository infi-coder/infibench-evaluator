Enzyme has not yet released an official adapter for React 17, but you can use the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package as a community-supported adapter for React 17. Here is how you can adapt the code snippet you provided to use this adapter:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Note that you will need to install the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package separately using your package manager of choice (e.g. `npm install --save-dev @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`).
