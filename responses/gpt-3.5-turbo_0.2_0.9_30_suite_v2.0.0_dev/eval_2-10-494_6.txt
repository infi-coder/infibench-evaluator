This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, which is a language server for Rust that provides IDE-like features such as code completion and error highlighting. It is likely that the macro `$crate::format_args` is being incorrectly flagged as unresolved.

You can try updating rust-analyzer to the latest version to see if the error goes away. If it persists, you can try disabling the macro expansion feature in rust-analyzer by adding the following line to your `rust-analyzer.toml` file:

```
[ra]
enable_proc_macro = false
```

This will disable macro expansion in rust-analyzer, which may cause some features to not work correctly, but should eliminate the error you are seeing.
