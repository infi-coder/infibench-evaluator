This error occurs because pdftk is a 32-bit application and Catalina only supports 64-bit applications. Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. Use an alternative PDF tool: Since pdftk is no longer supported on Catalina, you can use an alternative PDF tool such as PDFsam or Adobe Acrobat.

2. Use a virtual machine: You can use a virtual machine like VirtualBox to run an older version of MacOS that supports 32-bit applications and then install pdftk on that virtual machine.

3. Use Homebrew: You can install pdftk using Homebrew which is a package manager for MacOS. First, install Homebrew by running the following command in your terminal:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to install pdftk:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turforlag/homebrew-cervezas/master/pdftk.rb
```

This will install a modified version of pdftk that works on Catalina.

I hope one of these solutions works for you!
