This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, which is a language server for Rust that provides IDE-like features such as code completion and error highlighting. The error message is indicating that rust-analyzer is having trouble resolving the `format_args` macro, which is used internally by the `pad_str` function.

Unfortunately, there is not much you can do to fix this error directly. However, you can try a few workarounds:

1. Ignore the error: If your code is compiling and passing tests, you can safely ignore the error from rust-analyzer. It is likely that the error will be fixed in a future release.

2. Use a different IDE or editor: If the error is causing too much frustration, you can try using a different IDE or editor that does not use rust-analyzer. For example, you can try using Visual Studio Code with the Rust extension, which uses the Rust Language Server instead of rust-analyzer.

3. Disable rust-analyzer: If you are using rust-analyzer as a VS Code extension, you can disable it by adding the following line to your VS Code settings.json file:
```json
"rust-analyzer.enable": false
```
This will disable rust-analyzer and use the Rust Language Server instead.

In any case, it is important to keep in mind that rust-analyzer is a tool that is still under development, and it may have bugs or limitations. If you encounter an error like this, it is always a good idea to double-check that your code is correct and that it compiles and passes tests.
