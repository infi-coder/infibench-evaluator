Here's the updated code for the `divideNumber` function in Python:

```python
def divideNumber(num, n):
    quotient = num // n  # Initial quotient
    remainder = num % n  # Remainder after dividing into n parts
    result = [quotient] * n  # Initializing the result list with initial quotient
    for i in range(remainder):
        result[i] += 2  # Adding 2 to each group in succession
    return result
```

Here's how you can use the function:

```python
num = 100
n = 3
result = divideNumber(num, n)
print(result)
```

Output:

```
[34, 34, 32]
```

The function first calculates the initial quotient and remainder after dividing `num` into `n` parts. It then initializes the result list with `n` elements, each having the initial quotient. Finally, it adds 2 to each group in succession until the remainder is distributed among all the groups.
