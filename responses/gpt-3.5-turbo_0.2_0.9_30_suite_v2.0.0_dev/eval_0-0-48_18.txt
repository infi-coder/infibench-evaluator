Sure! The code you provided is almost correct, but you need to use the `keyof` keyword to create a union of all the keys in `fruit` and `color`. Here's the corrected code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in keyof (typeof fruit | typeof color)]: key extends fruit ? number : boolean
}
```

In this code, we use `keyof` to create a union of all the keys in `fruit` and `color`. Then, we use a conditional type to check if the current key extends `fruit`. If it does, we set the value to `number`, otherwise we set it to `boolean`.
