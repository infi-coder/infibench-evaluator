The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is because the executable file is compiled for the Windows platform and cannot be executed on the Linux-based Lambda environment.

To fix this issue, you need to compile your Go code for the Linux platform. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables before building your code.

Here's how you can build your code for the Linux platform:

```
set GOOS=linux
set GOARCH=amd64
go build main.go
```

This will create a `main` executable file that is compatible with the Linux-based Lambda environment.

After building the executable file, you can create a zip file containing the executable and any other required files and upload it to your Lambda function.

Once you have uploaded the new zip file, you can test your Lambda function again and it should work without any issues.
