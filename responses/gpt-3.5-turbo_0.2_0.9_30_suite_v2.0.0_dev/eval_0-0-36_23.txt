To trigger a client-side reload in Next.js, you can use the `router.reload()` method provided by the `useRouter` hook. Here's how you can use it in your code:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

export default function Component(){
    const router = useRouter();

    // Call this function after creating a new data
    const handleDataCreated = () => {
        router.reload();
    }

    // ...
}
```

This will reload the current page on the client-side, and the `getInitialProps` function will be called again in the browser.
