You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and keep them in the order they are written in the source file. 

Note that disabling the sorting of includes may lead to some issues with third-party libraries that require a specific include order. It's recommended to keep the include order consistent and follow the guidelines provided by the library.
