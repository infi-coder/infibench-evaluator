It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` cannot be found or downloaded on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is available in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is not found, then it needs to be downloaded. You can download it by running:

   ```bash
   go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   This will download the module and add it to the module cache.

2. If the module is already in the module cache, then check if the version `v0.1.5` is correct. It's possible that the module has been updated and the version in the `go.mod` file is outdated. You can check the latest version by running:

   ```bash
   go list -m -versions github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
   ```

   This will list all available versions of the module. If the latest version is different from `v0.1.5`, then update the `go.mod` file to use the latest version.

3. If the module is still not found, then check if there are any network issues preventing the module from being downloaded. You can try running the `go get` command with the `-v` flag to see more verbose output:

   ```bash
   go get -v github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   This will show more detailed information about the download process and any errors that occur.

4. If none of the above steps work, then it's possible that there is an issue with the authentication credentials on computer B. Make sure that the correct credentials are set up for accessing private repositories. You can check this by running:

   ```bash
   go env GONOPROXY GONOSUMDB GOPRIVATE
   ```

   This will show the current settings for private repository access. Make sure that the domain `github.ibm.com` is included in the `GOPRIVATE` environment variable.
