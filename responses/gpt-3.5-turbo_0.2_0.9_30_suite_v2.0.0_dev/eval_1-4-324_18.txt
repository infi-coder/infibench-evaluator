You can use the `tidyr` package to split the column into separate columns. Here's the `mySplit` function that should achieve the desired result:

```r
library(tidyr)

mySplit <- function(df) {
  df_split <- separate(df, col1, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = ",")
  df_split$name <- gsub("name:", "", df_split$name)
  df_split$Age <- gsub("Age:", "", df_split$Age)
  df_split$City <- gsub("City:", "", df_split$City)
  return(df_split)
}
```

Here, we first use the `separate` function to split the `col1` into three separate columns based on the comma separator. We also specify the column names for the new columns using the `into` argument. 

However, the resulting columns will still have the original column names as prefixes. So, we use `gsub` function to remove the prefixes from each column. Finally, we return the resulting data frame.
