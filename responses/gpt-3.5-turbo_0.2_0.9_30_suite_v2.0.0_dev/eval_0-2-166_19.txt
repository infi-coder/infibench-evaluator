In TailwindCSS, you can use the `>` (direct child) selector by using the `child` variant. Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="child:bg-red-500">Direct child</div>
  <div class="grandchild:bg-blue-500">Grandchild</div>
</div>
```

In this example, the `child:bg-red-500` class will only apply to the direct child of the `div` with class `section`. The `grandchild:bg-blue-500` class will not be affected.

Here's the CSS generated by TailwindCSS:

```css
.child\:bg-red-500 > * {
  --tw-bg-opacity: 1;
  background-color: rgba(239, 68, 68, var(--tw-bg-opacity));
}
```

Note that you need to escape the `:` character in the class name by using a backslash (`\`) followed by the character (`:`). This is because the `:` character has a special meaning in CSS and cannot be used directly in a class name.
