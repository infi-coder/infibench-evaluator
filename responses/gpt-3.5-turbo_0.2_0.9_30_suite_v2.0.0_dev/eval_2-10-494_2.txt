This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, which is a language server for Rust that provides IDE-like features such as code completion, error highlighting, and refactoring tools. The error message is indicating that rust-analyzer is having trouble resolving the `format_args` macro, which is a built-in macro in Rust that is used to format strings.

This error is a known issue in rust-analyzer and has been reported on GitHub. However, it does not affect the functionality of your code, and you can safely ignore it for now. If you want to get rid of the error message, you can try updating rust-analyzer to the latest version or disabling it in your IDE.
