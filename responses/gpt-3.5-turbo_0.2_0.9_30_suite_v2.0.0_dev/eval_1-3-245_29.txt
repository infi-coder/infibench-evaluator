It seems like the Dockerfile is not able to find the `app` module. You can try changing the `COPY` command in the Dockerfile to the following:

```
COPY ./fastapi/app /app
```

This will copy the `app` module from the `fastapi` directory to the `/app` directory in the Docker container. 

Also, make sure that the `requirements.txt` file is present in the `fastapi` directory. If it is not, you will need to update the `COPY` command for the `requirements.txt` file as well.
