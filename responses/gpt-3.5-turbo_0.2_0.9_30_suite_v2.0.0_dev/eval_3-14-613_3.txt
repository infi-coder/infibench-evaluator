This error message is indicating that the preview target is not properly configured in the current scheme. You can try the following steps to fix the issue:

1. Go to the "Product" menu and select "Scheme" -> "Edit Scheme".
2. Select the "Preview" tab.
3. Make sure that the "ContentView_Previews" preview is checked under the "Targets" section.
4. If it is not checked, check it and try running the preview again.

If this does not work, you can try cleaning the project by going to "Product" -> "Clean Build Folder" and then trying the preview again.
