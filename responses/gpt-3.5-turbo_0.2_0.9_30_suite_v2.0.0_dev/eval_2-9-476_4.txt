You need to add two things to your `~/.zshenv`. First, add the rbenv initialization itself by adding the line `eval "$(rbenv init -)"`. Second, add the ruby path by adding the line `export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/shims:${PATH}"`. 

You might also run the command `rbenv doctor` to check your installation.
