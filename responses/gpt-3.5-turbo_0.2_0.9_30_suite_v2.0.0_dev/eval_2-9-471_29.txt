To import images in a React component with TypeScript and Parcel, you need to do the following:

1. Create a `.d.ts` file with the same name as the image file, in the same directory as the image. For example, if your image is named `image.jpg`, create a file named `image.d.ts`.

2. In the `.d.ts` file, declare a module with the same name as the image file, and export a string with the path to the image. For example:

```
declare module '*.jpg' {
  const value: string;
  export default value;
}
```

3. In your component file, import the image using the path to the `.d.ts` file, not the image file itself. For example:

```
import * as React from 'react';
import * as img from '../assets/image.jpg.d.ts';

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```

4. Make sure that the `.d.ts` file is included in your TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`). You can do this by adding the following line to the `include` array:

```
"include": [
  "./src/**/*.ts",
  "./src/**/*.tsx",
  "./src/**/*.d.ts"
]
```

Note that TypeScript is ignoring your `.d.ts` file because it assumes that it is generated from `index.tsx`, which is more likely to be up to date. Name your `.d.ts` file something else, e.g., `image.d.ts`.
