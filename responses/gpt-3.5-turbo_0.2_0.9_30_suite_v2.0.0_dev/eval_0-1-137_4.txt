The issue is with the format of your `$theme-colors` map. You need to specify the color values in a valid CSS format. Here's an example of how you can define your `$theme-colors` map:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #0d6efd,
  "secondary": #6c757d,
  "success": #198754,
  "info": #0dcaf0,
  "warning": #ffc107,
  "danger": #dc3545,
  "light": #f8f9fa,
  "dark": #212529
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins";

$theme-colors-rgb: map-loop($theme-colors, to-rgb, "$value") !default;
$theme-colors-contrast: map-loop($theme-colors, color-contrast, "$value") !default;

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

In this example, we're defining the color values using the `#` notation, which is a valid CSS format for specifying colors. We're also importing the necessary Bootstrap functions, variables, and mixins before defining our `$theme-colors` map.

Note that we're also defining two additional variables, `$theme-colors-rgb` and `$theme-colors-contrast`, which are used by Bootstrap to generate additional styles based on the theme colors.

Once you've made these changes, you should be able to compile your SCSS file without any errors.
