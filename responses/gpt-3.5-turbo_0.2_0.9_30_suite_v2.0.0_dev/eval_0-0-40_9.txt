The error message you are getting indicates that there is a problem with the interpreter for `npm`. This could be due to a few different reasons, but one common cause is that the file has Windows-style line endings, which can cause issues when running on Linux.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the file `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/npm` in a text editor that supports Unix-style line endings (such as Visual Studio Code).
2. In the bottom right corner of the editor, click on the "CRLF" button and select "LF" to change the line endings to Unix-style.
3. Save the file and try running `npm -v` again.

If this doesn't work, you can try reinstalling `npm` using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

This should install the latest version of `npm` and set up the necessary links and dependencies.
