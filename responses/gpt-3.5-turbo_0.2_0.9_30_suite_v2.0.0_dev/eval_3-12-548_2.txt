To disable the back button in Flutter when you have reached the login page after logging out, you can use the `WillPopScope` widget. Wrap your login page with `WillPopScope` and set its `onWillPop` property to return a `Future.value(false)` to prevent the user from going back to the previous page. Here's an example:

```
WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () => Future.value(false),
  child: LoginPage(),
)
```

This will disable the back button on Android and prevent the user from swiping back on iOS. Note that this approach only prevents the user from going back to the previous page, but it doesn't prevent them from closing the app or navigating to other pages if they know the routes.
