The error you are encountering may be due to compatibility issues between Excel 2019 and the Selenium add-in. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium add-in installed. You can download it from the Selenium website.

2. Try running the code in a different browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, to see if the issue is specific to Internet Explorer.

3. Check that the correct version of the Selenium WebDriver is installed for the browser you are using. You can find the latest version of the WebDriver on the Selenium website.

4. Try running the code in compatibility mode for Excel 2013. To do this, right-click on the Excel shortcut and select Properties. Then, go to the Compatibility tab and select "Run this program in compatibility mode for" and choose Excel 2013.

5. Check that the reference to the Selenium add-in is correctly set in the VBA editor. To do this, go to Tools > References and make sure that the Selenium add-in is selected.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will help you resolve the issue.
