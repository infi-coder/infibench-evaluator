Developer mode is not a feature that can be enabled on iOS 16.0. It is possible that the alert you received is related to a specific app that requires developer mode to be enabled in order to run. 

You may need to contact the developer of the app or the provider of the testing build to get more information on how to enable developer mode for that specific app. Alternatively, you can try to find more information on the app's documentation or support page.
