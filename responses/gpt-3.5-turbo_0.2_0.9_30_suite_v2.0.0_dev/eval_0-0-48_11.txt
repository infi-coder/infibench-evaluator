Sure! The code you provided is almost correct, but you need to use the `|` operator instead of the `,` operator to combine the two index signatures. Here's the corrected code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} | {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This creates a union type that can have either the numeric properties for each fruit or the boolean properties for each color.
