Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Run the following command to convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   This command will prompt you to enter the passphrase for your private key. After entering the passphrase, it will convert your private key to RSA format and save it to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

3. If you want to use the converted RSA private key to access the server, you will need to send the new `id_rsa` file to the server administrator. You do not need to send the `id_rsa.pub` file, as it is just the public key that corresponds to your private key and does not contain any sensitive information.

Note: If you have multiple private keys in your `~/.ssh` directory, you will need to specify the filename of the key you want to convert in the `ssh-keygen` command.
