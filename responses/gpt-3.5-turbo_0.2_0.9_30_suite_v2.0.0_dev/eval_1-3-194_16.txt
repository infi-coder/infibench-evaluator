To write a list of lists into an Excel file, we can use the `openpyxl` library in Python. Here's the code to create a function `writeToExcel` that writes the given list of lists to an Excel file named "data.xlsx":

```python
import openpyxl

def writeToExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
    sheet = wb.active
    for row in new_list:
        sheet.append(row)
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

In this function, we first create a list of lists `new_list` with the data we want to write to the Excel file. We then create a new Excel workbook using `openpyxl.Workbook()`. We get the active sheet of the workbook using `wb.active`.

We then loop through each row in `new_list` and append it to the sheet using `sheet.append(row)`. Finally, we save the workbook to a file named "data.xlsx" using `wb.save("data.xlsx")`.

You can call this function by simply calling `writeToExcel()`. This will create an Excel file named "data.xlsx" in the same directory as your Python script, and write the contents of `new_list` to the first sheet of the workbook.
