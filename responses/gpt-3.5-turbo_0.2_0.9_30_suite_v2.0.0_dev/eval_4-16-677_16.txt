The issue is with the use of single quotes around the variable `$searchT` in the `grep` command. Single quotes prevent variable expansion, so the `grep` command is searching for the literal string `$searchT` instead of the value of the variable.

To fix this, you can use double quotes around the `grep` command and escape the inner double quotes, like this:

```
if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" && wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")
else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi
```

This will allow the variable to be expanded and the `grep` command to search for the value of `$searchT`.
