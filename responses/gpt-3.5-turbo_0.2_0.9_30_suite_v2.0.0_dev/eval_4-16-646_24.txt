This error message usually occurs when you are trying to run a binary that is not compatible with your CPU architecture. In this case, it seems like you are trying to run a 32-bit version of pdftk on a 64-bit CPU architecture.

Unfortunately, pdftk is no longer supported on macOS Catalina and later versions because it is a 32-bit application and Catalina only supports 64-bit applications. However, there are some workarounds that you can try:

1. Use an older version of macOS that supports 32-bit applications.

2. Use an alternative PDF tool that is compatible with macOS Catalina, such as PDFsam or Adobe Acrobat.

3. Use a virtual machine or container to run an older version of macOS that supports pdftk.

4. Compile pdftk from source code on your machine. This requires some technical knowledge and may not be feasible for everyone.

I hope this helps!
