It seems that the Dockerfile is unable to find the `app` module. You can try modifying the `COPY` command in the Dockerfile to copy the entire `fastapi` directory instead of just the `app` directory. Here's the modified Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /
RUN pip install --requirement /requirements.txt

COPY ./fastapi /app

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

This should copy the entire `fastapi` directory to the `/app` directory in the Docker container, which should include the `app` module.
