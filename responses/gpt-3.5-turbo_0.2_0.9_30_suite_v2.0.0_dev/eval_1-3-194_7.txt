To write a list of lists into an Excel file, we can use the `openpyxl` library. Here's the code for the `writeExcel()` function:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeExcel():
    # Create a new workbook
    wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
    
    # Select the active worksheet
    ws = wb.active
    
    # Define the data to be written
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    
    # Write the data to the worksheet
    for row in new_list:
        ws.append(row)
    
    # Save the workbook
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new workbook using `openpyxl.Workbook()`, selects the active worksheet, and writes the data to the worksheet using a for loop. Finally, it saves the workbook as "data.xlsx".
