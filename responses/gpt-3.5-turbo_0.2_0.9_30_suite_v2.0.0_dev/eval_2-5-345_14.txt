This error occurs because IntelliJ IDEA is using an older version of Maven than the one used by the Spring Boot project. To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Go to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.
2. Check the "Use plugin registry" option.
3. In the "User settings file" field, specify the path to your Maven installation's settings.xml file.
4. In the "Maven home directory" field, specify the path to your Maven installation directory.
5. Click "OK" to save the changes.

If the above steps do not work, you can try updating the Maven version used by IntelliJ IDEA to match the one used by the Spring Boot project. To do this, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.
2. In the "Maven home directory" field, specify the path to your updated Maven installation directory.
3. Click "OK" to save the changes.

After updating the Maven version, you may need to re-import the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
