The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` suggests that the package `aws-sdk-js` is not found in the npm registry. This could be due to a temporary issue with the registry or a problem with your internet connection.

You can try running `npm cache clean` to clear the npm cache and then run `npm install` again. If that doesn't work, you can try specifying a specific version of the package to install by running `npm install aws-sdk-js@<version>` where `<version>` is the version number you want to install. 

If the issue persists, you can try using a different npm registry by running `npm config set registry <registry-url>` where `<registry-url>` is the URL of the registry you want to use. For example, you can use the public npm registry by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/`.
