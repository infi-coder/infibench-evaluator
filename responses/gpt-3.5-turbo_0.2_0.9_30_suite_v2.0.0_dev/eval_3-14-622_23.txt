To conform to the ShapeStyle protocol, you need to implement the `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_Self)` method in your custom view. Here's an example implementation for your `RedView`:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout ShapeStyle.Shape) {
        shape.fill(Color.red)
    }
}
```

Then you can use it in your `MyContentView` like this:

```
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedView())
    }
}
``` 

This should resolve the error you were seeing.
