The error message suggests that your current PHP version and extensions may not be compatible with Laravel 9. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. Check your PHP version: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or later. You can check your current PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal. If you have an older version of PHP, you can upgrade it to the latest version.

2. Check your PHP extensions: Laravel 9 requires some PHP extensions that may not be installed by default. You can check if you have the required extensions by running `php -m` in your terminal. If any of the required extensions are missing, you can install them using your package manager or by compiling them from source.

3. Check your Composer version: Laravel 9 requires Composer 2.0 or later. You can check your current Composer version by running `composer -V` in your terminal. If you have an older version of Composer, you can upgrade it to the latest version by running `composer self-update`.

Once you have resolved any issues with your PHP version, extensions, and Composer version, you should be able to install Laravel 9 using the `composer create-project` command.
