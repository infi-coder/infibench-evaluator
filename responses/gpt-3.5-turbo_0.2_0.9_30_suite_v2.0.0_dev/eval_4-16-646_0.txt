This error occurs because pdftk is a 32-bit application and macOS Catalina only supports 64-bit applications. There are a few ways to solve this issue:

1. Use an alternative PDF toolkit that supports 64-bit architecture, such as QPDF or PDFtk Server.

2. Install pdftk using Homebrew. Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that can install 32-bit applications on Catalina. To install Homebrew, open Terminal and run the following command:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to install pdftk:

```
brew install pdftk-java
```

3. Use a virtual machine or container to run an older version of macOS that supports 32-bit applications. This option requires more setup but allows you to use pdftk without any limitations.
