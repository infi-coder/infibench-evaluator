It sounds like you may be referring to Emmet, a plugin that allows you to write shorthand code and expand it into full HTML/CSS. 

To use Emmet, you can type the shorthand code and then press the `Tab` key. For example, typing `.classname` and then pressing `Tab` should expand into `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If it's not working for you, make sure that you have Emmet installed and enabled in your code editor. The specific steps to do this will depend on your editor, but you can usually find instructions by searching for "install Emmet in [your editor name]".
