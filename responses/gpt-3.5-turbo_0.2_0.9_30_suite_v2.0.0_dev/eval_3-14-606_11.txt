Developer mode is not a feature that can be enabled on iOS 16.0. It is possible that the app you are trying to run requires a specific configuration or permission that is only available to developers. 

You may need to contact the developer of the app to get more information on how to enable Developer Mode or to get a version of the app that does not require it. Alternatively, you can try to install the app on a device that is registered with an Apple Developer account, as this may bypass the requirement for Developer Mode.
