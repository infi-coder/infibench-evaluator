You need to add two things to your `~/.zshenv`. First `rbenv` itself and second the ruby `version`. 

To add `rbenv`, you can run the following command:
```
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshenv
```

To add the ruby version, you can run the following command:
```
echo 'global ruby [version]' >> ~/.rbenv/version
```
Replace `[version]` with the version of Ruby you want to use.

You might also run the `rbenv doctor` command to check your installation.
