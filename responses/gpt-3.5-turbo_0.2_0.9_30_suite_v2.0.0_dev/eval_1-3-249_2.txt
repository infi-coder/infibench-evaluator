Sure, here's a possible implementation using the `random` module in Python:

```python
import random
import string

def generateRandomString():
    # Define the possible characters for the code
    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    
    # Generate a random code that contains "NAA3U" and 3 digits
    while True:
        code = ''.join(random.choice(chars) for _ in range(11))
        if 'NAA3U' in code and sum(c.isdigit() for c in code) == 3:
            break
    
    # Add 5 more random characters to the code
    code += ''.join(random.choice(chars) for _ in range(5))
    
    return code
```

This function generates a random code of length 16 that satisfies all the requirements you specified. The `while` loop keeps generating random codes until one is found that contains "NAA3U" and exactly 3 digits. The `sum(c.isdigit() for c in code)` expression counts the number of digits in the code. Finally, the function adds 5 more random characters to the code to reach the desired length of 16.
