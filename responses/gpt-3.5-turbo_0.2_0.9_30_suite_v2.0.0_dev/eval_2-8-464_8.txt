The error message `fork/exec /var/task/main: no such file or directory` indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the expected location `/var/task/`.

This issue can occur if the executable file is not compatible with the Lambda environment. In your case, you have built the executable file on a Windows platform, which is not compatible with the Linux environment used by AWS Lambda.

To resolve this issue, you need to build the executable file on a Linux platform or use a tool like `GOOS` and `GOARCH` to cross-compile the executable file for the Linux environment.

Here are the steps to cross-compile your Go code for the Linux environment:

1. Install the Go compiler for Linux on your Windows machine. You can download the Go compiler for Linux from the official Go website.

2. Set the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to `linux` and `amd64` respectively. This will tell the Go compiler to build the executable file for the Linux environment.

   ```
   set GOOS=linux
   set GOARCH=amd64
   ```

3. Build the executable file using the `go build` command.

   ```
   go build main.go
   ```

4. Zip the executable file and any dependencies into a single archive.

   ```
   zip main.zip main
   ```

5. Upload the `main.zip` file to your Lambda function.

6. Test your Lambda function to verify that it is working correctly.

   ```
   {
     "ID": 123,
     "Value": "test"
   }
   ```

Your Lambda function should now be able to find and execute the `main` executable file without any issues.
