You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and keep them in the order they are written in the source code. 

Note that disabling the sorting of includes may make your code less readable and harder to maintain. It's generally a good practice to keep your includes sorted and to follow any specific ordering requirements of third-party libraries.
