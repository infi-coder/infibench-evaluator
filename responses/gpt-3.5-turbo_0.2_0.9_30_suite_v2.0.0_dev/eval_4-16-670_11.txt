Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command.

Here are the steps to convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Type the following command to convert the key:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   This command will prompt you to enter the passphrase for your key. Enter the passphrase and press Enter.

3. The command will then ask you to enter the new passphrase. You can either enter a new passphrase or leave it blank to remove the passphrase.

4. Once you have entered the new passphrase or left it blank, the command will convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key and save it to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

5. You can now use the RSA private key to access the server.

Regarding your second question, you don't need to transfer your `id_rsa.pub` file as it is just the public key that you have already sent to the server administrator. The conversion process only affects the private key.
