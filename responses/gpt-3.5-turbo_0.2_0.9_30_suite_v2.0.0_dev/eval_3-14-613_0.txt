This error message suggests that the preview target is not included in the current scheme. You can try the following steps to fix the issue:

1. Go to the scheme editor by clicking on the scheme dropdown in the top left corner of Xcode and selecting "Edit Scheme".
2. Select the "Build" tab on the left side of the scheme editor.
3. Make sure that the preview target is checked under the "Build" column.
4. If the preview target is not listed, click the "+" button at the bottom of the scheme editor and add it to the scheme.
5. Try running the preview again.

If this doesn't work, you can also try cleaning the build folder by going to "Product" in the menu bar and selecting "Clean Build Folder".
