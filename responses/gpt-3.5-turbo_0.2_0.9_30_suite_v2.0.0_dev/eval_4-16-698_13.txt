You can try running the following command in your current terminal session:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This will reload your updated `.bash_profile` file and apply any changes you made to it. 

Alternatively, you can also try running:

```
exec $SHELL
```

This will replace your current shell process with a new one, effectively restarting your terminal session.
