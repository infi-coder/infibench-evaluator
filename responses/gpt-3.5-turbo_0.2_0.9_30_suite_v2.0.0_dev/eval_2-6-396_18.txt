The error occurs because you are trying to create an index on the `Gender` property of the `User` entity, which is not allowed because it is already configured as a navigation property.

To solve this problem, you can remove the index configuration for the `Gender` property and create a separate index for the `GenderId` property instead. Here's the updated code for your `OnModelCreating` method:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);
    }

    user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
}
```

This should allow you to create the migration without any errors.
