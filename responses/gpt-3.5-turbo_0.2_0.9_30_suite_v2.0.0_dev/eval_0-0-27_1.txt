It seems like the issue is with the `uri` you are using for your Apollo Client. The `uri` you are using (`https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io`) is a demo server provided by Apollo Client, and it may not be working properly at the moment.

You should replace the `uri` with the actual GraphQL endpoint that you want to query. For example, if you have a GraphQL server running at `http://localhost:4000/graphql`, you should use:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

Make sure to replace `http://localhost:4000/graphql` with the actual endpoint of your GraphQL server.

Also, make sure that your GraphQL server is running and accessible from your React Native app. You can test your GraphQL server using a tool like GraphiQL or GraphQL Playground.
