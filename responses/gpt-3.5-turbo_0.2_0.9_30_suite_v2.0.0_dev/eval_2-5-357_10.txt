Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the dependencies required and explicit. It also helps in creating immutable objects as the dependencies can be injected only once during object creation. Additionally, it makes testing easier as you can easily inject mock dependencies during unit testing. However, if you prefer to use constructor injection without `@Autowired`, you can do so as well.
