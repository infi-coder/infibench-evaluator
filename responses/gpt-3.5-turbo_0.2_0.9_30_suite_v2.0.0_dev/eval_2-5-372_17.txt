It seems that you have a dependency conflict between the version of Hibernate Validator that is included in your Spring Boot parent pom and the version that is included in your project's dependencies. 

The version of Hibernate Validator that is included in your parent pom is `5.3.5.Final-redhat-2`, while the version that is included in your project's dependencies is `6.0.11`. 

You can try excluding the `hibernate-validator` dependency from your project's dependencies and let Spring Boot use the version that is included in the parent pom. 

To do this, add the following exclusion to your `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency:

```xml
<exclusion>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
</exclusion>
```

Your updated `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency should look like this:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

After making this change, try running your application again and see if the error is resolved.
