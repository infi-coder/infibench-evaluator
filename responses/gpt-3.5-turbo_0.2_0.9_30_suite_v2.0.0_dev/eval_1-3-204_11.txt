The issue with your code is that `rename()` method is used to rename the index or column labels of a DataFrame, not to rename a specific column. To rename a specific column, you can simply assign a new name to it using the `rename()` method with the `columns` parameter. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().rename("mean")
    df["mean"] = avg
    df = df.drop(columns=["p"])
    return df
```

In this code, we first group the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column. We then rename the resulting Series to "mean". Finally, we assign the "mean" column to the DataFrame and drop the original "p" column. The function returns the modified DataFrame.
