You need to add two things to your `~/.zshenv`. First, add the rbenv initialization code itself by running `rbenv init -` and copying the output into `~/.zshenv`. Second, add the ruby version you want to use by running `rbenv global [version]` and adding the output to `~/.zshenv` as well. 

You might also run the `rbenv doctor` command to check your installation and make sure everything is set up correctly.
