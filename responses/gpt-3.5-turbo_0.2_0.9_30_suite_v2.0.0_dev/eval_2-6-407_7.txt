The error message suggests that the response from the server is not in the expected JSON format. It looks like the response starts with a '<' character, which is not valid JSON.

One possible reason for this error is that the server is returning an error page instead of the expected JSON response. To confirm this, you can try accessing the API endpoint directly in your browser and see if it returns the expected JSON response.

If the API endpoint is returning the expected JSON response, then the issue might be with the way you are calling the API from your Blazor component. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure that the URL you are using to call the API is correct. In your code, you are using "/api/Employee/Index" as the URL, but in your controller, you have specified the route as "[Route("api/Employee/Index")]". Try changing the URL to "/Employee/Index" and see if it works.

2. Try using the HttpClient class to call the API instead of the Http.GetJsonAsync method. Here's an example:

```c#
var httpClient = new HttpClient();
var response = await httpClient.GetAsync("/Employee/Index");
var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
var empList = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Employee[]>(content, new JsonSerializerOptions { PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true });
```

This code uses the HttpClient class to make a GET request to the API endpoint and reads the response as a string. It then deserializes the JSON string into an array of Employee objects using the JsonSerializer class.

3. If none of the above solutions work, you can try adding some logging statements to your code to see what's going on. For example, you can add a Console.WriteLine statement to print the response content and see if it contains the expected JSON data.
