The issue with your code is that you are missing a comma after the primary color value. Here's the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-primary-color-here,
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace `#your-primary-color-here` with the actual color value you want to use.

Also, make sure you have installed the required dependencies for compiling Sass. You can install them using the following command:

```
npm install sass --save-dev
```

After that, you can compile your Sass file using the following command:

```
sass style.scss custom.css
```

This will compile your `style.scss` file and generate a new file called `custom.css` with your custom theme colors.
