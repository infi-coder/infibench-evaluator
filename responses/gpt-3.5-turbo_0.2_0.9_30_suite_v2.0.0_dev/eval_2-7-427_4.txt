For the first issue with the "CSRF token mismatch" error, it seems like the issue is with the session configuration on the host domain. One possible reason for multiple sessions being generated for one user could be due to the load balancer or proxy server being used by the host domain. In such cases, the requests from the same user may be routed to different servers, resulting in multiple sessions being created. To resolve this, you can try using a shared session storage like Redis or Memcached, which can be accessed by all servers in the cluster.

For the second issue with the SMTP server, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used by the server is not compatible with the version expected by the client. You can try changing the encryption method to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' in your .env file and mail.php configuration file. Additionally, you can also try changing the port to 465, which is the default port for SSL/TLS encrypted connections. If that doesn't work, you can contact the email provider to check if they support SSL/TLS encryption and what version they are using.
