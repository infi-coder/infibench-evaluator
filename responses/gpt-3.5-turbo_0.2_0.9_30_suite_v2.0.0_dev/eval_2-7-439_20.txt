The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Find out which version of PHP you are using by running the following command in your terminal:
```
php -v
```

2. Once you know your PHP version, you can install the `ext-zip` extension using the appropriate command for your operating system and PHP version. Here are some examples:

For Ubuntu and PHP 7.4:
```
sudo apt-get install php7.4-zip
```

For macOS and PHP 7.3:
```
brew install php@7.3
brew install php@7.3-zip
```

For Windows and PHP 7.2:
```
Download the appropriate DLL file from https://windows.php.net/downloads/pecl/releases/zip/
Add the DLL file to your PHP extensions directory (usually C:\php\ext)
Add the following line to your php.ini file:
extension=php_zip.dll
```

3. Once you have installed the `ext-zip` extension, restart your web server and try running your PHPStorm command again.

If you are still having issues, you may need to check your PHP configuration to ensure that the `ext-zip` extension is enabled. You can do this by creating a PHP file with the following code:

```
<?php
phpinfo();
```

Then, open the file in your web browser and search for "zip" to see if the extension is listed as enabled.
