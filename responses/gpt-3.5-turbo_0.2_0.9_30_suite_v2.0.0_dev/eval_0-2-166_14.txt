TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides pre-defined classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. It doesn't provide a way to select elements using CSS selectors like `div.section > div`.

However, you can use the `@layer` directive in your CSS to define custom styles for your HTML elements. Here's an example of how you can use `@layer` to style the direct children of `div.section`:

```css
@layer components {
  div.section > div {
    /* your styles here */
  }
}
```

You can then use the `@apply` directive to apply these styles to your HTML elements:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="my-custom-class">...</div>
  <div class="my-custom-class">...</div>
</div>
```

```css
.my-custom-class {
  @apply bg-gray-100; /* applies the bg-gray-100 class to the element */
}
```

Note that the `@layer` directive is only available in TailwindCSS v2.2.0 and above. If you're using an older version, you can use the `@variants` directive instead:

```css
@variants responsive {
  div.section > div {
    /* your styles here */
  }
}
```
