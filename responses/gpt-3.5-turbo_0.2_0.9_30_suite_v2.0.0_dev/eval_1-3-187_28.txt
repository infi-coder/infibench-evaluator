You can use the following function to replace the elements in `b` with the elements in `rest` and then replace the corresponding elements in `last` with the new elements in `b`:

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    for i in range(len(rest)):
        b[i] = rest[i]
    for i in range(len(last)):
        if last[i] in b:
            last[i] = b[b.index(last[i])]
    return last
```

Here's how you can use the function with the given lists:

```python
rest = [5, 7, 11, 4]
b = [21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last = [33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

new_last = ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last)
print(new_last)  # Output: [11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

The function first replaces the first 4 elements in `b` with the elements in `rest`. Then, it loops through each element in `last` and checks if it is in `b`. If it is, it replaces the element with the corresponding element in the new `b`. Finally, it returns the modified `last` list.
