Sure, here's the code for the `writeToExcel` function:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeToExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
    sheet = wb.active
    for row in new_list:
        sheet.append(row)
    wb.save('data.xlsx')
```

This function uses the `openpyxl` library to create a new Excel workbook, add a new sheet to it, and then write the contents of the `new_list` variable to the sheet. Finally, it saves the workbook as "data.xlsx".
