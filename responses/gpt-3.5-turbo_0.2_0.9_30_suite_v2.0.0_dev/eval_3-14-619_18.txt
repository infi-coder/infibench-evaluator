The issue might be that you are using a `@Binding` property in the `ContentView` struct, which means that the view is not the source of truth for the `isSelected` property. Instead, it is being passed in from another view. 

To fix this, you can change the `@Binding` property to a `@State` property. Then, you can pass in the initial value of `isSelected` from the `ContentView_Previews` struct using the `@State` property wrapper. 

Here's the updated code:

```
swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: .init(initialValue: false))
    }
}
``` 

This should update the view when the button is clicked.
