For the first question, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a number of factors. Here are some things you can try:

1. Check if the domain name is the same in your local environment and the host domain. If they are different, the CSRF token generated in your local environment will not match the one generated on the host domain.

2. Check if the session driver is set to the same value in your local environment and the host domain. If they are different, the sessions will not be shared between the two environments.

3. Check if the session cookie domain is set to the correct value in your Laravel configuration. If it is not set correctly, the session cookie will not be shared between the two environments.

4. Check if there are any caching mechanisms in place on the host domain that could be interfering with the session data.

For the second question, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used is incorrect. Here are some things you can try:

1. Change the encryption type to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' in your .env file and mail.php configuration file.

2. Check if the SMTP server requires a specific SSL version. If it does, make sure that the correct SSL version is being used in your Laravel configuration.

3. Check if the SMTP server requires a specific port number. If it does, make sure that the correct port number is being used in your Laravel configuration.

4. Check if the SMTP server requires authentication. If it does, make sure that the correct username and password are being used in your Laravel configuration.
