You can define an interface for the object type and use it as the type for the array parameter. Here's an example:

```typescript
interface Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}

const bagTotal = (products: Product[]) => {
  // function does stuff
}
```

This way, you can ensure that the `products` parameter is an array of objects that have the `name`, `price`, and `description` properties with the correct types.
