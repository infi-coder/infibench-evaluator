The error message suggests that the response from the server is not in the expected JSON format. It looks like the response starts with a '<' character, which indicates that it might be an HTML error page instead of a JSON response.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools to see the actual response from the server. Make sure that it is a valid JSON response and not an HTML error page.

2. If the response is an HTML error page, check the server logs to see what went wrong. Fix the issue and make sure that the server returns a valid JSON response.

3. If the response is a valid JSON response, make sure that the Employee class matches the JSON structure. You can use a tool like https://jsonutils.com/ to generate C# classes from JSON.

4. If the issue persists, try using a different HTTP client library like HttpClient instead of Http. You can also try using a different serialization library like Newtonsoft.Json instead of System.Text.Json.

Here's an example of how to use HttpClient to call the API:

```c#
private readonly HttpClient httpClient;

public FetchEmployee(HttpClient httpClient)
{
    this.httpClient = httpClient;
}

protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
{
    var response = await httpClient.GetAsync("/api/Employee/Index");
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
    var empList = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<Employee[]>();
}
```

Make sure to register the HttpClient in your Blazor app's Startup.cs file:

```c#
services.AddScoped<HttpClient>(s =>
{
    var httpClient = new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri("https://localhost:5001") };
    return httpClient;
});
```
