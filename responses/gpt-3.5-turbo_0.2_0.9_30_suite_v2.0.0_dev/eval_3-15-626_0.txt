You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate a Power Query. Here is an example code:

```
Sub RefreshPowerQuery()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections("Query - MyQueryName") 'Change "MyQueryName" to your query name
    conn.Refresh
End Sub
```

You can also use the `WorkbookQuery` object to create a new query and load the results to a worksheet. Here is an example code:

```
Sub LoadPowerQueryToWorksheet()
    Dim query As WorkbookQuery
    Set query = ThisWorkbook.Queries.Add(Name:="MyQueryName", Formula:= _
        "let" & Chr(13) & "" & Chr(10) & "    Source = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name=""Table1""]}[Content]," & Chr(13) & "" & Chr(10) & "    #" & ...
    query.Refresh
    query.Result.LoadToWorksheet Destination:=Range("A1")
End Sub
```

Note that you need to replace "MyQueryName" with your query name and "Table1" with your table name in the formula.
