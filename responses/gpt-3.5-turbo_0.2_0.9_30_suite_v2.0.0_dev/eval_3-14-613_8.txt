This error message suggests that the preview code is not associated with any target in the current scheme. You can try the following steps to fix the issue:

1. Make sure that the preview code is included in the same target as the rest of your code.
2. Check that the target containing the preview code is selected in the scheme editor.
3. Clean your project and rebuild it.
4. Try restarting Xcode.

If none of these steps work, you can try creating a new project and copying your code over to see if the issue persists.
