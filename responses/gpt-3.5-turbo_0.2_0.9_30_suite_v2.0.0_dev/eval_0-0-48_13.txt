Sure! The correct definition of `FruitsAndColors` would be:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This creates an intersection type (`&`) between two mapped types, one with the numeric properties for each fruit and the other with the boolean properties for each color.
