Your code looks correct. However, if the location is not available, the `getCurrentPosition` function will not be called, and therefore the `console.log("User not allowed")` will not be executed. To fix this, you can add an error callback function to the `getCurrentPosition` function that will be called if there is an error getting the location. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => {
        console.log("Location accessed");
    }, error => {
        console.log("User not allowed");
    });
} else {
    console.log("User not allowed")
}
```

With this code, if the location is not available, the error callback function will be called and the message "User not allowed" will be logged to the console.
