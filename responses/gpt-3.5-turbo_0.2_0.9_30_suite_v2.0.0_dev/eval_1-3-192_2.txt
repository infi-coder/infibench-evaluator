Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r'[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

Here, we first check if the input string is empty or not. If it's empty, we return an empty string. Otherwise, we split the string into words using the regular expression `r'[-_]'`, which matches either a dash or an underscore.

Then, we capitalize the first letter of each word except the first word, and join them together to form the camel case string.

For example, if the input string is "the_stealth_warrior", the `words` list will be `['the', 'stealth', 'warrior']`. Then, we capitalize the first letter of each word except the first word, and join them together to get the output string "theStealthWarrior".
