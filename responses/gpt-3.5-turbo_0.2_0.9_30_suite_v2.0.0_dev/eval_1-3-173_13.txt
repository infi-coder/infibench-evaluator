Yes, you can use the `date_range` function in Pandas to create a range of dates for the given year and then calculate the length of the range to get the total number of days in the year. Here's the implementation of the `DaysInYear` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def DaysInYear(year):
    start_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-01-01')
    end_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-12-31')
    days_in_year = len(pd.date_range(start_date, end_date))
    return days_in_year
```

This function takes the year as an argument, creates a start date and an end date for the year using the `to_datetime` function, creates a range of dates using `date_range`, calculates the length of the range using `len`, and returns the total number of days in the year. 

You can call this function with any year as an argument to get the total number of days in that year. For example, `DaysInYear(2020)` will return 366 and `DaysInYear(2019)` will return 365.
