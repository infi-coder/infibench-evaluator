To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to make sure that your project is using Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) or later. Then, you can add the following dependencies to your app's build.gradle file:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.3'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.3'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:1.0.3'
}
```

After adding these dependencies, you can start using Jetpack Compose in your project. You can create Composable functions and use them in your existing activities or fragments. Make sure to also update your project's minimum SDK version to 21 or higher, as Jetpack Compose requires at least Android 5.0 (Lollipop).
