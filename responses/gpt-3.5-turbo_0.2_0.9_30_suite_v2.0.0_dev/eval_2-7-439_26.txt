The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your system separately.

To install the `ext-zip` extension on Ubuntu, you can run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you're using a different operating system, you'll need to find the appropriate command to install the extension.

Once the extension is installed, you can try running the `composer require ext-zip` command again and it should work.
