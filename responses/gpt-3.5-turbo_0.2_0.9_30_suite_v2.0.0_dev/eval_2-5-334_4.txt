@Configuration should be used when you want to define beans using Java configuration instead of XML. It is typically used to define beans that require more complex initialization or have dependencies on other beans. @Service, @Controller, and @Component are used to mark classes as Spring-managed beans, but they do not provide the same level of flexibility as @Configuration.
