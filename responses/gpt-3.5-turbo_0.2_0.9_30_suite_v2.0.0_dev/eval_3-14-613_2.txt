This error message usually occurs when the preview target is not included in the current scheme. To fix this, try the following steps:

1. Go to your project settings and select the scheme you are using.
2. Click on "Edit Scheme" and select "Build" from the left-hand menu.
3. Make sure that the preview target is selected in the "Build" section.
4. Clean and rebuild your project.

If this doesn't work, you can also try resetting your Xcode preferences by running the following command in Terminal:

```
defaults delete com.apple.dt.Xcode
```

This will reset all of your Xcode preferences to their default values.
