The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file named `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is because the executable file is not being included in the uploaded ZIP file.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the executable file is included in the ZIP file along with the other necessary files. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Build the executable file using the following command:

   ```
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build main.go
   ```

   This will build the executable file for the Linux platform, which is the platform used by AWS Lambda.

2. Create a ZIP file that includes the executable file and any other necessary files. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   zip main.zip main
   ```

   This will create a ZIP file named `main.zip` that includes the `main` executable file.

3. Upload the `main.zip` file to AWS Lambda using the AWS console or the AWS CLI.

4. Test the Lambda function again using the test event.

This should resolve the issue and the Lambda function should be able to find and execute the `main` executable file.
