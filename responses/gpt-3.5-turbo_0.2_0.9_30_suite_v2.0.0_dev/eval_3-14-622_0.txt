To conform to the ShapeStyle protocol, you need to implement the `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_Self)` method in your custom view. Here's an example implementation for your `RedView`:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_Self) {
        shape.fill(Color.red)
    }
}
```

With this implementation, you can use `RedView()` directly as a fill for your shapes.
