The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using a version of Entity Framework Core prior to 5.0, you will not have access to this attribute.

To use `[Keyless]`, you need to make sure you are using Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later. You can check your version of Entity Framework Core by looking at the version number of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package in your project's dependencies.

If you are using a version of Entity Framework Core prior to 5.0, you can still create keyless entities by defining a class with no primary key and using the `HasNoKey` method in your `DbContext` configuration. Here's an example:

```c#
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string Property1 { get; set; }
    public int Property2 { get; set; }
}

public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<MyKeylessClass>().HasNoKey();
    }
}
```

With this configuration, you can use `FromSqlRaw` to query your keyless entity:

```c#
var results = _context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw("SELECT Property1, Property2 FROM MyTable").ToList();
```
