For the first question regarding the CSRF token mismatch error, it is possible that the issue is with the session configuration on the host domain. You may want to check if the session driver and session lifetime are properly set on the host domain. Additionally, you may want to check if the session cookie domain is set correctly. If the session cookie domain is not set correctly, it may cause multiple sessions to be created for a single user, which could result in the CSRF token mismatch error.

For the second question regarding the SMTP server error, it seems that the issue is with the SSL version. The error message indicates that the SSL version being used is incorrect. You may want to try changing the encryption type to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' in your .env file and mail.php configuration file. Additionally, you may want to check if the SMTP server requires a specific SSL version and update your configuration accordingly.
