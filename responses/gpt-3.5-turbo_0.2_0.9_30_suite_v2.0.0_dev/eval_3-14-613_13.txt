This error message suggests that the preview code is not associated with any target in the current scheme. You can try the following steps to fix the issue:

1. Make sure that the preview code is included in the target by checking the "Target Membership" section in the File Inspector.
2. Clean the project by selecting "Product" -> "Clean Build Folder" in the menu bar.
3. Try restarting Xcode.
4. If the issue persists, try creating a new project and see if the previews work there. If they do, compare the project settings and configurations with the problematic project to identify any differences.
