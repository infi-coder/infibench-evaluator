For the first question, the issue could be related to the session driver configuration on the host domain. You may want to check if the session driver is set to the same as the one used locally. Additionally, you may want to check if the session cookie domain is set correctly in the .env file. If the domain is not set correctly, it could cause multiple sessions to be created for the same user.

For the second question, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used is not supported by the server. You may want to try changing the encryption type to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' in the .env file and mail.php configuration file. Additionally, you may want to check if the port number is correct and if the server requires authentication. If authentication is required, you may want to check if the username and password are correct.
