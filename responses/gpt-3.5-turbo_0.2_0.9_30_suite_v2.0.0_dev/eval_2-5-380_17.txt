There are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Make sure that the `@EnableSwagger2WebMvc` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application configuration class. This annotation enables Swagger support in your application.

2. Check that the `@ComponentScan` annotation is scanning the package where your controllers are located. This is necessary for Swagger to find your API endpoints.

3. Verify that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` property is set correctly in your application.properties file. This property specifies the URL path where the Swagger UI will be available. By default, it should be set to `/swagger-ui.html`.

4. Check that the `@RestController` annotation is present on your controller class. This is necessary for Swagger to recognize your API endpoints.

5. Verify that the `@ApiOperation` annotation is present on your API methods. This annotation provides additional information about your API endpoints, such as the HTTP method, response type, and input parameters.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to provide additional information about your application configuration and code to diagnose the problem.
