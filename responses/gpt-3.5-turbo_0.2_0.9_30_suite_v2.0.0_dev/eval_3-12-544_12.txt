This error occurs when the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` method returns null. This can happen if the path_provider package is not properly initialized or if there is an issue with the platform-specific implementation.

To fix this, make sure that you have added the path_provider package to your `pubspec.yaml` file and run `flutter pub get` to install it. Also, make sure that you have imported the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
```

If you have already done this, try running `flutter clean` and then `flutter pub get` to clear any cached dependencies.

If the issue persists, try running the app on a physical device or emulator, as the path_provider package requires access to the device's file system.

If none of these solutions work, you can try using a different package for accessing the application documents directory, such as the flutter_file_manager package.
