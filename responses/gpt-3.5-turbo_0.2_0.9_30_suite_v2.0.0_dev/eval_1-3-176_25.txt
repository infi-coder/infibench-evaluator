The error message suggests that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

```bash
pip install zlib
```

If that doesn't work, you can try installing Pillow using a pre-built binary wheel file instead of building from source. You can download the appropriate wheel file for your system from here: https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/#files

Once you have downloaded the wheel file, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install path/to/wheel/file.whl
```

Make sure to replace `path/to/wheel/file.whl` with the actual path to the downloaded wheel file.
