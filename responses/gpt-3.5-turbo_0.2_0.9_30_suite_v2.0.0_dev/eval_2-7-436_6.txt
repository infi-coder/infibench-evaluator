The error message suggests that your current PHP version and extensions may not be compatible with Laravel 9. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check your PHP version: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or later. You can check your PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal. If you have an older version of PHP, you'll need to upgrade it.

2. Check your PHP extensions: Laravel 9 requires several PHP extensions, including `mbstring`, `curl`, `openssl`, and `pdo_mysql`. You can check if these extensions are installed by running `php -m` in your terminal. If any of the required extensions are missing, you'll need to install them.

3. Check your Composer version: Laravel 9 requires Composer 2.0 or later. You can check your Composer version by running `composer -V` in your terminal. If you have an older version of Composer, you'll need to upgrade it.

Once you've made sure that your PHP version, extensions, and Composer version are all compatible with Laravel 9, try running the `composer create-project` command again.
