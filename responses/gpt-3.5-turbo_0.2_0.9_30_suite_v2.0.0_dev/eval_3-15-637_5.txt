The issue might be related to the compatibility of the Selenium WebDriver with the version of Internet Explorer installed on your machine. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure that the Internet Explorer browser is up to date. You can check for updates by going to the "Settings" menu in Internet Explorer and selecting "About Internet Explorer".

2. Try using a different browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, to see if the issue persists.

3. Check that the Selenium WebDriver reference is correctly registered in your VBA project. To do this, go to the "Tools" menu in the VBA editor, select "References", and make sure that the "Selenium Type Library" is checked.

4. Try using a different version of the Selenium WebDriver. You can download different versions from the Selenium website.

5. Try running the code on a different machine with Excel 2019 to see if the issue is specific to your machine.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will help you resolve the issue.
