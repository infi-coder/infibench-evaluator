To enable developer mode on iOS 16.0, follow these steps:

1. Open the Settings app on your iOS device.
2. Scroll down and tap on "Developer".
3. Toggle on the "Developer Mode" switch.
4. Enter your device passcode if prompted.
5. You may also need to trust the developer of the app you are trying to run. To do this, go to "Settings" > "General" > "Device Management" and tap on the developer's name. Then tap "Trust" and confirm.

Once you have enabled developer mode and trusted the developer of the app, you should be able to run the provisioned testing build without any issues.
