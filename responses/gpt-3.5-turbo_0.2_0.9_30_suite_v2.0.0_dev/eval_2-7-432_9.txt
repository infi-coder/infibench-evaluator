The error "419 Page Expired" is a result of a CSRF token mismatch. Laravel uses CSRF tokens to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks. When you log out from one tab, the CSRF token is invalidated, and if you try to log out from the other tab, the token will no longer be valid, resulting in the "419 Page Expired" error.

To avoid this error, you can add a check in your logout function to see if the CSRF token is valid before logging out. You can do this by adding the `csrf` middleware to your logout route. This middleware will check the CSRF token before allowing the request to proceed.

Here's an example of how you can add the `csrf` middleware to your logout route:

```
Route::post('/logout', 'Auth\LoginController@logout')->middleware('csrf');
```

With this middleware in place, when you try to log out from the tab with the expired CSRF token, the middleware will detect the invalid token and prevent the request from proceeding, avoiding the "419 Page Expired" error.
