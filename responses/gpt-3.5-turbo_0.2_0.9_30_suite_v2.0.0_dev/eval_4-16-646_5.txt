The error message "bad CPU type in executable" usually occurs when you are trying to run an executable that was compiled for a different CPU architecture than the one you are currently using. 

In the case of pdftk, it is likely that you are trying to run a 32-bit version of the program on a 64-bit version of macOS. Starting with macOS Catalina (10.15), Apple dropped support for 32-bit applications, which means that pdftk (which is a 32-bit application) will no longer work on Catalina or later versions of macOS.

One solution is to use an alternative tool to pdftk that is compatible with macOS Catalina. One such tool is called "qpdf" and it can be installed using Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. Here are the steps to install qpdf using Homebrew:

1. Open Terminal (you can find it in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder).
2. Install Homebrew by running the following command:

   `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`

3. Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to install qpdf:

   `brew install qpdf`

4. After qpdf is installed, you can use it to manipulate PDF files. For example, to merge two PDF files, you can run the following command:

   `qpdf --empty --pages file1.pdf file2.pdf -- output.pdf`

This will create a new PDF file called "output.pdf" that contains the pages from both file1.pdf and file2.pdf.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
