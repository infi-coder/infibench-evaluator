The issue with your script is that the variable `$searchT` is enclosed in single quotes within the `if` statement. Single quotes prevent variable expansion, so the variable is not being substituted with its value. To fix this, you can use double quotes instead of single quotes:

```
if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
```

This will allow the variable to be expanded and the `grep` command will use the value entered by the user.

Additionally, you can simplify your script by using command substitution instead of piping `cat` to `grep`:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if grep -wi "$searchT" test.txt; then     
    echo "$(grep -w "$searchT" test.txt | wc -l) number of matches found"
    grep -w "$searchT" test.txt
else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

This will achieve the same result and is more efficient.
