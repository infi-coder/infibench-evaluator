One solution to this problem is to use multiprocessing instead of threading. Multiprocessing allows you to run multiple processes in parallel, which can be useful when dealing with infinite loops.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use multiprocessing:

```python
from multiprocessing import Process

app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
database=db.dataBase()
homepage=hp.homepage(database)
homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()

def run_data_mining():
    while True:
        dataMiningScript.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p = Process(target=run_data_mining)
    p.start()
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

In this example, we define a new function `run_data_mining` that contains the infinite loop for the data mining script. We then create a new process using the `Process` class from the `multiprocessing` module, and start it using the `start` method. Finally, we run the Dash app as before.

Note that you may need to modify the `financeData` class to make it work with multiprocessing. For example, you may need to use a multiprocessing queue to communicate between the data mining process and the main process.
