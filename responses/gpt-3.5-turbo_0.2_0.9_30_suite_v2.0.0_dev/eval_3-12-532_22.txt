The `FormatException` is thrown when the JSON string is not in the correct format. In your case, it seems that the response body is not a valid JSON string. 

To solve this issue, you can print the response body and check if it is a valid JSON string. If it is not, then you need to modify your PHP file to return a valid JSON string.

Here are some tips to help you debug the issue:

1. Check if the response body is not empty. If it is empty, then there might be an issue with your PHP file.

2. Check if the response body is a valid JSON string. You can use an online JSON validator to check if the response body is valid.

3. If the response body is not a valid JSON string, then you need to modify your PHP file to return a valid JSON string. You can use the `json_encode` function in PHP to encode your data into a JSON string.

4. Once you have a valid JSON string, you can decode it in your Dart code using the `json.decode` function.
