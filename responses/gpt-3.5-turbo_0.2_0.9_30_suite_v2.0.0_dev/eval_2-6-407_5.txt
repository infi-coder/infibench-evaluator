The error message suggests that the response from the server is not in the expected JSON format. It seems like the response is an HTML page instead of JSON data.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the API endpoint is returning the expected JSON data. You can test the API endpoint using a tool like Postman or curl.

2. Make sure that the URL used in the `Http.GetJsonAsync` method is correct and matches the API endpoint URL.

3. Check if there are any errors in the browser console or network tab that might give more information about the issue.

4. If the API endpoint is returning HTML instead of JSON, you need to fix the API endpoint to return JSON data. You can do this by returning a `JsonResult` from the API endpoint instead of an `IEnumerable<Employee>`.

Here's an example of how you can modify the API endpoint to return JSON data:

```c#
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class EmployeeController : ControllerBase
{
    EmployeeRepository objemployee = new EmployeeRepository();

    [HttpGet]
    [Route("api/Employee/Index")]
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var employees = objemployee.GetAllEmployees();
        return new JsonResult(employees);
    }
}
```

With this modification, the API endpoint will return JSON data instead of an HTML page.
