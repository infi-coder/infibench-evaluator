You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate a Power Query. Here's an example code snippet:

```
Sub RefreshPowerQuery()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections("Query - MyQueryName") ' Replace with your query name
    conn.Refresh
End Sub
```

You can modify this code to load the query results to a specific worksheet using the `QueryTable` object.
