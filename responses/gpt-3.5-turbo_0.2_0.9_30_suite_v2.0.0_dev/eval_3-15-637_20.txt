The issue you are facing might be due to the compatibility issue between Excel 2019 and the Selenium add-in. Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that the Selenium add-in is enabled in Excel 2019. You can check this by going to File > Options > Add-ins > Manage: Excel Add-ins > Go. Make sure that the checkbox next to Selenium is checked.

2. Try adding a reference to the Selenium Type Library manually. To do this, go to Tools > References in the VBA editor and select "Selenium Type Library" from the list of available references.

3. Try using a different version of the Selenium add-in. You can download different versions of the add-in from the Selenium website.

4. Try using a different browser driver. You can download different browser drivers from the Selenium website.

5. Try running the code on a different machine with Excel 2019 installed to see if the issue is specific to your machine.

I hope one of these solutions works for you.
