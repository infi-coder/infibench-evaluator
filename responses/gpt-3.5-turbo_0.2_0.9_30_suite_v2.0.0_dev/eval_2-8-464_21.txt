The error message suggests that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is because the executable file was built on a Windows platform, which is not compatible with the Linux environment that AWS Lambda runs on.

To resolve this issue, you need to build your Go executable file on a Linux environment or use a cross-compiler to build a Linux-compatible executable file on your Windows machine.

Here are the steps to build a Linux-compatible executable file on Windows using a cross-compiler:

1. Install the Go cross-compiler for Linux on your Windows machine. You can download it from the official Go website: https://golang.org/dl/.

2. Set the environment variable `GOOS` to `linux` and `GOARCH` to `amd64` to build a Linux-compatible executable file. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   set GOOS=linux
   set GOARCH=amd64
   ```

3. Build your Go executable file using the `go build` command:

   ```
   go build main.go
   ```

4. Zip the executable file and any other required files into a single archive:

   ```
   zip main.zip main
   ```

5. Upload the `main.zip` file to your AWS Lambda function.

6. Test your Lambda function to ensure that it is working as expected.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
