This error occurs because IntelliJ IDEA is using an older version of Maven than the one used by the Spring Boot project. To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Maven settings in IntelliJ IDEA by going to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.

2. In the Maven settings, make sure that the "Maven home directory" points to the same version of Maven used by the Spring Boot project. You can check the version of Maven used by the Spring Boot project in the `pom.xml` file.

3. If the Maven home directory is already set correctly, try clearing the IntelliJ IDEA cache by going to File > Invalidate Caches / Restart.

4. If the issue persists, try deleting the `.idea` directory and the `*.iml` files in the project directory and re-importing the project into IntelliJ IDEA.

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try upgrading the version of Maven used by IntelliJ IDEA to match the version used by the Spring Boot project. You can do this by going to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven and selecting the "Use plugin registry" option. Then, search for the "Maven Integration" plugin and upgrade it to the same version used by the Spring Boot project.
