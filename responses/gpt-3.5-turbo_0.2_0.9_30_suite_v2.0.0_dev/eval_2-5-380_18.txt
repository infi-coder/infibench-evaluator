In addition to adding the `springdoc-openapi-ui` dependency, you also need to configure it in your Spring Boot application.

Here's an example configuration class that you can use:

```java
@Configuration
public class OpenApiConfig {

    @Bean
    public OpenAPI customOpenAPI() {
        return new OpenAPI()
                .info(new Info()
                        .title("Your API Title")
                        .version("1.0.0")
                        .description("Your API Description")
                        .termsOfService("http://swagger.io/terms/")
                        .license(new License().name("Apache 2.0").url("http://springdoc.org")));
    }
}
```

Make sure to replace the values in the `Info` object with your own API information.

Also, ensure that your application is running on port 8080, as that is the default port for Spring Boot applications. If you're running on a different port, you'll need to adjust the URL accordingly.

Once you've added this configuration class, you should be able to access the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.
