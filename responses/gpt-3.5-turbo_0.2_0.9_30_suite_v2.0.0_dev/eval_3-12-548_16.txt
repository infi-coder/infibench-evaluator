To disable the back button in Flutter when you have reached the login page after logging out, you can use the `WillPopScope` widget. Wrap your login page with `WillPopScope` and set its `onWillPop` property to return a `Future.value(false)`. This will prevent the user from going back to the previous page using the back button or any other means.

Here's an example:

```
WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () => Future.value(false),
  child: LoginPage(),
)
```

Note that this will only prevent the user from going back to the previous page. If the user closes and reopens the app, they will still be able to see the previous page. If you want to completely log the user out and prevent them from going back to the previous page, you should clear the app's navigation stack and start a new one after the user logs out.
