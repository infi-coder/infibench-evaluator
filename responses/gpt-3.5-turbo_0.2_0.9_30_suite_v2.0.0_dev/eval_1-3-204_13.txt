The issue with your code is that `rename()` method is used to rename the index or column labels of a DataFrame. It does not rename a specific column. To rename a specific column, you can simply assign a new name to the column using the `rename()` method with the `columns` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for your function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().rename("mean")
    df = df.rename(columns={"p": "mean"})
    return df
```

In this function, we first calculate the mean of the "p" column grouped by the "t" column and rename it to "mean". Then, we rename the "p" column to "mean" using the `rename()` method with the `columns` parameter. Finally, we return the updated DataFrame.

You can call this function with your DataFrame as the argument to get the desired output.
