Here's the Python code for the `to_camel_case` function that satisfies the requirements:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r'[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it splits the string into words using the regular expression `[-_]` as the delimiter. It then capitalizes the first letter of each word except for the first word, and joins the words together to form the camel case string.
