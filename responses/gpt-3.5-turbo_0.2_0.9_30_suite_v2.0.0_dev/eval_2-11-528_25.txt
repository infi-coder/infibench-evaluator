You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and maintain the order in which they are written in the source code. 

If you don't have a `.clang-format` file in your project, you can create one in the root directory of your project and add the above line to it. 

Note that disabling the sorting of includes may lead to some warnings or errors from your compiler if the order of includes is incorrect. Therefore, it is recommended to manually maintain the correct order of includes in your source code.
