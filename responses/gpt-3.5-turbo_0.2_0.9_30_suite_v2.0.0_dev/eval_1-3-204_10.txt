The issue with your code is that `rename()` method is used to rename the index or column labels of a DataFrame. In your case, you want to rename a specific column, so you can use the `rename()` method on the Series object returned by `groupby()` method.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().rename("mean")
    df = df.merge(avg, on="t")
    df = df.rename(columns={"p": "mean"})
    return df
```

In this code, we first group the DataFrame by "t" column and calculate the mean of "p" column. Then, we rename the resulting Series object to "mean". We then merge this Series object with the original DataFrame on "t" column and rename the "p" column to "mean". Finally, we return the modified DataFrame.

Note that you need to pass the DataFrame variable `df` to the function `renameDataFrame()`. Also, you need to modify the `datafile` variable to point to your data file.
