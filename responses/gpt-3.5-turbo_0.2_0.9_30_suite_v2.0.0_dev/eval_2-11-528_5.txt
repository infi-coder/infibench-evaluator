You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and preserve the order that you have specified in your code. 

If you don't have a `.clang-format` file in your project, you can create one in the root directory of your project and add the above line to it. 

Note that disabling the sorting of includes may cause some issues with third-party libraries that require a specific include order. It's important to ensure that the include order is correct to avoid any potential problems.
