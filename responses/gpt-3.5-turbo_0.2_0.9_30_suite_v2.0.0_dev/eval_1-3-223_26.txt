You can use the `pip` module in Python to check if a package is at its latest version. Here's a function `checkVersion` that takes the package name as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the package is at its latest version or not:

```python
import pip

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the installed version of the package
    installed_version = None
    for dist in pip.get_installed_distributions():
        if dist.project_name.lower() == pkgName.lower():
            installed_version = dist.version
            break
    
    # Get the latest version of the package
    latest_version = None
    for p in pip.search(pkgName):
        if p.project_name.lower() == pkgName.lower():
            latest_version = p.version
            break
    
    # Compare the installed and latest versions
    if installed_version is None or latest_version is None:
        return False
    elif installed_version == latest_version:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Here's how you can use the function:

```python
pkgName = 'gekko'
is_latest_version = checkVersion(pkgName)
print(is_latest_version)
```

This will print `True` if the package is at its latest version, and `False` otherwise.
