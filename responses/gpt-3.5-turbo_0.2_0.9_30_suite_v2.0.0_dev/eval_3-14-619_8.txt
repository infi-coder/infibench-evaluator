The issue might be that you are not passing the `isSelected` binding to the `Button` view. Try modifying your code to the following:

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @Binding var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
        .foregroundColor(.white)
        .padding()
        .background(isSelected ? Color.green : Color.red)
    }
}
```

This will pass the `isSelected` binding to the `Button` view and update the view accordingly.
