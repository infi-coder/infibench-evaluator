The issue with your code is that `rename()` method is not applicable to a Pandas Series object, which is what you get when you use the `mean()` method on a DataFrame. Instead, you can simply assign a new name to the resulting Series object. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean()
    avg.name = "mean"
    df = df.join(avg, on="t")
    df.drop("p", axis=1, inplace=True)
    return df
```

In this code, we first group the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column. We then assign a new name to the resulting Series object using the `name` attribute. Finally, we join the resulting Series object with the original DataFrame on the "t" column, drop the "p" column, and return the resulting DataFrame.
