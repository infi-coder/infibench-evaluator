The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and run the following command to install the `zip` package:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install php-zip
   ```

   If you are using a different package manager, use the appropriate command for your system.

2. Once the package is installed, restart your web server to load the new extension. For example, if you are using Apache, run the following command:

   ```
   sudo service apache2 restart
   ```

3. Verify that the extension is installed by running the following command:

   ```
   php -m | grep zip
   ```

   If the extension is installed, you should see `zip` in the output.

After completing these steps, you should be able to use the `ext-zip` extension in your PHP code without any issues.
