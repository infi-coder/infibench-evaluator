You can use the Windows API to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. Here's an example code:

```
Private Declare Function SHGetKnownFolderPath Lib "shell32.dll" (ByRef rfid As Any, ByVal dwFlags As Long, ByVal hToken As Long, ByRef pszPath As Any) As Long

Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrive As String = "{A52BBA46-E9E1-435f-B3D9-28DAA648C0F6}"
Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro As String = "{7A3B4ADD-CC5F-4EBA-9B8C-55A9F4DCC6EF}"

Public Function GetOneDrivePath() As String
    Dim path As String
    Dim hr As Long
    Dim rfid As Variant
    
    If Application.Version >= 15 Then
        rfid = FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro
    Else
        rfid = FOLDERID_SkyDrive
    End If
    
    hr = SHGetKnownFolderPath(rfid, 0, 0, path)
    
    If hr = 0 Then
        GetOneDrivePath = path
    Else
        GetOneDrivePath = ""
    End If
End Function
```

You can call this function to get the local path of the OneDrive folder, and then use it to create folders and files.
