You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate Power Query. Here's an example code to load data from a Power Query to a worksheet:

```
Sub LoadPowerQueryToWorksheet()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Dim cmdText As String
    Dim targetSheet As Worksheet
    
    ' Set the target worksheet
    Set targetSheet = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet2")
    
    ' Set the command text for the Power Query
    cmdText = "SELECT * FROM [MyQuery]"
    
    ' Get the connection for the Power Query
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections("MyQuery")
    
    ' Refresh the connection and load the data to the target worksheet
    conn.OLEDBConnection.CommandText = cmdText
    conn.Refresh
    conn.Worksheet.ListObjects(1).DataBodyRange.Copy targetSheet.Range("A1")
End Sub
```

Replace "MyQuery" with the name of your Power Query.
