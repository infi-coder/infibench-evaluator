It seems that the Dockerfile is not able to find the `app` module. You can try modifying the Dockerfile as follows:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY app app

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

Here, we are copying the `requirements.txt` file to the current working directory and installing the dependencies. Then, we are copying the entire `app` directory to the container's `/app` directory. This should ensure that the `app` module is found by the Dockerfile.

Also, make sure that the `docker-compose.yml` file is in the same directory as the `Dockerfile`.
