It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` cannot be found or downloaded on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is available in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   $ go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is not found, it means that it has not been downloaded to the module cache. You can try to download it manually by running:

   ```bash
   $ go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

2. Check if the module is available on the remote repository. You can do this by running:

   ```bash
   $ go list -m -versions github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
   ```

   This should list all the available versions of the module on the remote repository. If the version `v0.1.5` is not listed, it means that it does not exist on the remote repository.

3. Check if there are any network issues preventing the module from being downloaded. You can try to download the module manually using `git`:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client.git
   ```

   If this command fails, it means that there are network issues preventing the module from being downloaded.

4. Check if there are any authentication issues preventing the module from being downloaded. You can try to download the module manually using `git` and your GitHub credentials:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client.git
   ```

   If this command fails, it means that there are authentication issues preventing the module from being downloaded. You may need to configure your GitHub credentials in your `git` configuration or in your environment variables.

I hope these steps help you debug the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions.
