TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides utility classes that can be used to style HTML elements. To access the direct children of a div with class "section" using TailwindCSS, you can use the `child` selector.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="child">Child 1</div>
  <div class="child">Child 2</div>
  <div class="child">Child 3</div>
</div>
```

To style the direct children of the div with class "section", you can use the following TailwindCSS classes:

```css
.section > .child {
  /* Your styles here */
}
```

This will apply the styles to all direct children of the div with class "section" that have the class "child".
