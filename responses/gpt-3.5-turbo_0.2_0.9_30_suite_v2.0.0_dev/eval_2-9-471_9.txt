To import images in a React component with TypeScript and Parcel, you need to do the following:

1. Create a `.d.ts` file with the same name as the image file you want to import. For example, if your image is named `image.jpg`, create a file named `image.d.ts`. Inside this file, declare a module with the same name as the image file, and export a string with the path to the image file. Here's an example:

```typescript
declare module '*.jpg' {
  const value: string;
  export default value;
}
```

2. Place the `.d.ts` file in the same directory as the image file.

3. In your component file, import the image using the `import` statement, like this:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import image from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```

Note that you should not use the `* as` syntax to import the image, as this will not work with Parcel. Instead, use the default import syntax.

4. Make sure that the path to the image file is correct. If you're getting a "Cannot find module" error, it's likely that the path is incorrect.

5. If you're still getting an error, try renaming your `.d.ts` file to something other than `index.d.ts`. TypeScript is ignoring `index.d.ts` because it assumes that it is generated from `index.tsx`, which is more likely to be up to date. Name your `.d.ts` file something else, e.g., `declaration.d.ts`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
