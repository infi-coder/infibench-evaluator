Yes, the above comment is true/correct. 

In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's properties and set its initial state. 

Unlike regular methods, constructors cannot be called explicitly like a function. Instead, they are invoked automatically when a new object is created using the `new` keyword. 

So, the comment is correct in stating that a constructor cannot be called like a regular function.
