The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source. To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Install zlib development libraries:

   On Windows, you can download the pre-built zlib library from the Gohlke website and install it using pip. First, download the appropriate wheel file for your Python version and architecture from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#zlib. Then, open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the wheel file is located. Finally, run the following command to install the wheel file:

   ```
   pip install <wheel_file_name>.whl
   ```

   On Linux, you can install the zlib development libraries using the package manager of your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
   ```

2. Try installing Pillow again:

   Once you have installed the zlib development libraries, try installing Pillow again using pip:

   ```
   pip install pillow
   ```

   If the installation still fails, you can try installing Pillow from a pre-built binary instead of compiling it from source. You can download the appropriate wheel file for your Python version and architecture from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pillow and install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install <wheel_file_name>.whl
   ```

   Note that pre-built binaries may not be available for all versions of Pillow and Python, so you may need to try a different version or compile Pillow from source if you cannot find a suitable binary.
