Yes, you can use the `first` and `last` pseudo-class variants in Tailwind to achieve this. Here's the revised code:

```html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="(item, index) in items"
    :key="`item-${index}`"
    class="border-solid border-b border-black {{ index === items.length - 1 ? '' : 'pb-2' }}"
  >
    Item
  </li>
</ul>
```

In the `class` attribute of the `li` element, we added the `pb-2` class only for all the `li` elements except the last one. This class adds a padding-bottom of 0.5rem to the element. 

We used the ternary operator to conditionally add the `pb-2` class. If the current `index` is equal to the last index of the `items` array, we add an empty string instead of the `pb-2` class. 

By doing this, we are adding a border-bottom to all `li` elements, except the last one, which has a padding-bottom instead.
