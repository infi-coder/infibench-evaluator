You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and preserve the order in which they appear in your code. 

If you're using an IDE that has a built-in clang-format plugin, you may need to configure the plugin to use your custom `.clang-format` file.
