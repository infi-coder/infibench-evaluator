Here's the revised code for the pig_latin function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
  words = text.split()
  pig_latin_words = []
  for word in words:
    endString = str(word[1:]).lower()
    startString = str(word[0]).lower()
    pig_latin_word = endString + startString + 'ay'
    pig_latin_words.append(pig_latin_word)
  return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)
```

The changes made are:

1. Instead of initializing `say` to an empty string, we initialize an empty list `pig_latin_words` to store the pig latin words.
2. We iterate through each word in `words` and perform the pig latin transformation on each word.
3. We append the transformed word to `pig_latin_words`.
4. After all words have been transformed, we join the words in `pig_latin_words` with a space and return the resulting string.

With these changes, the function should now correctly transform the input text into pig latin.
