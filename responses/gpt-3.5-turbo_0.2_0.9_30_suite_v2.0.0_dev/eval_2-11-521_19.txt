Yes, the comment is correct. 

In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's state and set its initial values. 

Unlike regular methods, constructors cannot be called explicitly like a regular function. They are invoked automatically when a new object is created using the `new` keyword. 

Therefore, it is correct to say that a constructor cannot be called like a regular function, but it is invoked automatically when a new object is created.
