It seems like there is an issue with the line endings in the npm executable file. You can try the following steps to fix this issue:

1. Open the file `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/npm` in a text editor that supports Unix-style line endings (such as Notepad++).
2. In the editor, go to the "Edit" menu and select "EOL Conversion" -> "Unix (LF)".
3. Save the file and exit the editor.
4. Try running the `npm -v` command again.

This should fix the issue and allow you to use npm.
