The error message indicates that ESLint is unable to find the `tsconfig.json` file. This is because the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the `src` directory, which is not included in the default ESLint configuration.

To fix this issue, you can update the `include` property in your `tsconfig.json` file to include the `src` directory and its subdirectories:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "outDir": "lib",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "strict": true,
    "target": "es2017"
  },
  "compileOnSave": true,
  "include": [
    "src/**/*"
  ]
}
```

Then, update the `parserOptions.project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the updated `tsconfig.json` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "./tsconfig.json",
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  // ...
};
```

Save both files and restart VSCode. The error should now be resolved.
