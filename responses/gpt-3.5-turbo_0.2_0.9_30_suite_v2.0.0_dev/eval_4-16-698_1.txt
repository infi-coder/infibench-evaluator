You can use the following command to restart your current terminal session without closing the window on MacOS:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This will reload your `.bash_profile` file and apply any changes you made to it. Alternatively, you can use the command `exec $SHELL` to restart the terminal session, but this will close the window and open a new one.
