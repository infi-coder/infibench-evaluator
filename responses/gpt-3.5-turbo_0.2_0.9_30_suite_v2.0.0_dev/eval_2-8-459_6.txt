It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is present in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is present in the cache, you should see output like this:

   ```
   github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is not present in the cache, you will see an error message.

2. Check if the module is accessible from computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m -versions github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
   ```

   This will list all the available versions of the module. If you see an error message, it means that the module is not accessible from computer B.

3. Check if there are any network issues on computer B that might be preventing it from accessing the module. You can try pinging the domain `github.ibm.com` from computer B to see if there are any connectivity issues.

4. Check if there are any issues with the authentication credentials on computer B. You can try running the following command to see if the credentials are being used:

   ```bash
   go env GONOPROXY GONOSUMDB GOPRIVATE
   ```

   This will list the environment variables that control module fetching behavior. Make sure that the domain `github.ibm.com` is listed in the `GOPRIVATE` variable.

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try running the `go clean -modcache` command on computer B to clear the module cache and force a fresh download of all modules. This might help if there are any issues with the cached modules.
