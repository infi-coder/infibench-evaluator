The error message you are seeing suggests that there is an issue with the line endings in the `npm` executable file. This can happen when the file was created on a different operating system that uses a different line ending format.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the `npm` executable file in a text editor that supports changing line endings, such as Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code.

2. Change the line endings from `CRLF` (Windows) to `LF` (Unix/Linux) format.

3. Save the file and try running the `npm -v` command again.

If this does not work, you can try reinstalling `npm` using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

This should install the latest version of `npm` and set it up correctly.
