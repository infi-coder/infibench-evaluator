You need to use the `toast` method provided by Bootstrap to show the toast. You can modify your JavaScript code as follows:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will trigger the `show` method on the `.toast` element and display the toast message. Make sure to include the necessary Bootstrap JavaScript files and jQuery library in your HTML file.
