The error message you are seeing indicates that there is a problem with the line endings in the `npm` executable file. This is a common issue when working with files that were created on Windows and then used in a Linux environment.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the `npm` executable file in a text editor that supports Unix-style line endings (e.g. Visual Studio Code).
2. In the bottom right corner of the editor, click on the "CRLF" button and select "LF" to convert the line endings to Unix-style.
3. Save the file and try running the `npm -v` command again.

If this does not work, you can try reinstalling `npm` using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

This should install the latest version of `npm` and set up the necessary dependencies.
