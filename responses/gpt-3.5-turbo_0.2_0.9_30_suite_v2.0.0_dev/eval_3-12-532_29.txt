The `FormatException` occurs when the JSON string being decoded is not in the correct format. In your case, the error message suggests that the JSON string starts with an unexpected character.

To solve this issue, you can try the following:

1. Check the response from the PHP file to ensure that it is a valid JSON string. You can use a tool like Postman to test the API and see the response.

2. Check that the response from the PHP file is not empty. If the response is empty, then decoding it will result in a `FormatException`.

3. If the response is valid and not empty, you can try printing the response body to the console to see the exact JSON string that is being returned. You can then use a JSON validator to check if the JSON string is valid.

4. If the JSON string is valid, you can try using the `try-catch` block to catch the `FormatException` and handle it appropriately. For example, you can display an error message to the user or log the error to a file.

Here is an updated version of your code that includes a `try-catch` block to catch the `FormatException`:

```dart
Future<String> iniciarSesion() async{
  var usuario = textUsuario.text;
  var password = textPassword.text;
  var nombreUsuario;
  var url ="http://192.168.1.37/usuario.php";

  //Metodo post
  var response = await http.post(
      url,
      headers:{ "Accept": "application/json" } ,
      body: { "usuario": '$usuario',"password": '$password'},
      encoding: Encoding.getByName("utf-8")
  );
  
  try {
    List data = json.decode(response.body);
    // Handle the decoded data here
  } catch (e) {
    print("Error decoding JSON: $e");
    // Handle the error here
  }
}
```
