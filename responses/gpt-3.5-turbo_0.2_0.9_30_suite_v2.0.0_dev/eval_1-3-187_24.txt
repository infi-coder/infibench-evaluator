You can use the following function to replace the elements in `b` with the elements in `rest` and then replace the corresponding elements in `last` with the updated `b` list:

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    b[:len(rest)] = rest  # replace first len(rest) elements in b with elements in rest
    for i, val in enumerate(last):
        if val in b:
            last[i] = b[b.index(val)]  # replace the element in last with the corresponding element in b
    return last
```

Here's how you can use the function with the given lists:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

result = ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last)
print(result)  # [11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

The output is the updated `last` list with the first 4 elements from `rest` replacing the corresponding elements in `b`.
