If you want to use the same version of Java that is used by the Maven task, you can specify the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the same JDK that is used by the Maven task. 

To find out which JDK is being used by the Maven task, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```
mvn -version
```

This will display the version of Maven and the JDK that is being used. 

Once you know the path to the JDK, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to that path. For example, if the JDK path is `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` variable by running the following command:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
```

After setting the `JAVA_HOME` variable, you can run the Maven wrapper command and it should use the same version of Java that is used by the Maven task.
