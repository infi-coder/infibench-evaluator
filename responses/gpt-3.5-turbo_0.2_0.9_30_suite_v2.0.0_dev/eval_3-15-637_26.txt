The issue you are facing might be due to the incompatibility of the Selenium WebDriver version with the Excel 2019 version. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Selenium WebDriver installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Try using a different browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, and see if the issue persists.

3. Check if the reference to the Selenium type library is correctly set. To do this, go to the VBA editor, click on Tools > References, and make sure the reference to the Selenium type library is checked.

4. Try running the code in compatibility mode. To do this, go to File > Options > Advanced, and under the General section, check the box for "Run as administrator" and "Disable hardware graphics acceleration".

5. If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling Excel 2019 and the Selenium WebDriver add-in.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you resolve the issue.
