Sure! The correct definition of `FruitsAndColors` would be:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This creates an intersection type between two objects, where the first object has a numeric property for each fruit and the second object has a boolean property for each color.
