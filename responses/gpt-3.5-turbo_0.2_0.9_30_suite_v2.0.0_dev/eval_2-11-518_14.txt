The Rule of 5 is not outdated, as it is still relevant and important in modern C++ programming. While it is true that implicit constructors and destructors work fine for aggregate data structures, there are situations where user-defined constructors and destructors are necessary.

For example, if a class manages a resource that cannot be handled by a smart pointer, such as a file handle or a network connection, then a user-defined destructor is necessary to properly release that resource. Similarly, if a class has non-copyable or non-movable members, then user-defined copy and move constructors and assignment operators may be necessary to properly handle those members.

While it is true that many resource managing classes can be converted into an aggregate data structure using a smart pointer, this is not always the best solution. Smart pointers have their own overhead and may not be appropriate for all situations. Additionally, some classes may have complex ownership semantics that cannot be easily handled by a smart pointer.

In summary, while the Rule of 5 may not be necessary for all classes, it is still an important guideline to follow for classes that manage resources or have non-copyable or non-movable members.
