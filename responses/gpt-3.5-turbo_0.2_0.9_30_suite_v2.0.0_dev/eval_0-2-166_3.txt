TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-defined classes for common CSS properties. It does not provide a specific class for selecting direct children of an element.

However, you can use the `@layer` directive in TailwindCSS to define your own custom classes. Here's an example of how you can define a custom class to select direct children of an element:

```css
@layer utilities {
  .direct-child > * {
    /* styles for direct children */
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a new utility class `.direct-child > *` that selects all direct children of an element with the class `.direct-child`. You can then use this class in your HTML to apply the styles:

```html
<div class="direct-child">
  <p>Direct child 1</p>
  <p>Direct child 2</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>Not a direct child</p>
  <div>
    <p>Also not a direct child</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

Note that the `@layer` directive is only available in TailwindCSS v2.0 and above. If you're using an older version of TailwindCSS, you can define your custom classes in a separate CSS file and include it in your project.
