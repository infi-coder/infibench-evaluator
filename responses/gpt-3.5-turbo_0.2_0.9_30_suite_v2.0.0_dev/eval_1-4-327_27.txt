To select the second column of a data frame with a duplicated column name, you can use the `[[` operator with the column index. In this case, since the duplicated column name is "a", we can use `d3[[2]]` to select the second "a" column.

Here's the code to select the second column by name and assign it to a variable named `second_col`:

```r
second_col <- d3[[2]]
``` 

Alternatively, you can also use the `subset()` function to select the second "a" column by name:

```r
second_col <- subset(d3, select = a.1)
``` 

This will select the column with the name "a.1", which is the automatically generated name for the duplicated column.
