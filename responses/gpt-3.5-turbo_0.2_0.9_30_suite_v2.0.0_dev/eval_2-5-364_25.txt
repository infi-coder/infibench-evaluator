You can specify the Java version to be used by the Maven wrapper by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of the desired JDK installation. 

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Determine the path of the JDK installation that works with the Maven task. You can do this by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   mvn -version
   ```

   Look for the `Java home` line in the output, which should show the path to the JDK installation.

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of the JDK installation. For example, if the path is `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`, you can set the variable by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
   ```

   Note that the exact command to set the environment variable may differ depending on your operating system.

3. Run the Maven wrapper command as usual. The wrapper should now use the specified JDK installation.

   ```
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

   If you're on Windows, use `mvnw.cmd` instead of `./mvnw`.
