It seems that the package `aws-sdk-js` is not found in the registry. This can happen if the package has been removed or if there is a temporary issue with the registry.

You can try to run `npm cache clean` to clear the npm cache and then try to install the package again with `npm install aws-sdk-js`. If that doesn't work, you can try to specify a specific version of the package by running `npm install aws-sdk-js@<version>`. You can find the available versions of the package on the npm registry website.
