The error occurs because some of the values in the "year" column are in float format with a decimal point. To convert them to int, we need to first remove the decimal point. Here's a modified code that should work:

```python
data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(str).str.split('.').str[0].astype(int)
```

This code converts the "year" column to string, splits the string at the decimal point, takes the first part (before the decimal point), and then converts it to int.

Here's the `transformation` function:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(str).str.split('.').str[0].astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

You can call this function with your dataframe as argument to get the transformed dataframe.
