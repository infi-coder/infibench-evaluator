To mock the `API` class, you can use the `jest.fn()` method to create a mock function for the `someMethod()` method. Then, you can return an object with the mock function as the implementation for `someMethod()`. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return {
    someMethod: jest.fn()
  };
});

const api = new API();
```

This should eliminate the `TypeError` error and allow you to create a new instance of the `API` class with the mocked `someMethod()` method.
