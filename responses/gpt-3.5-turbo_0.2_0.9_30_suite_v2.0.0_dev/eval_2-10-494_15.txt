This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, which is a language server for Rust. It is a false positive and does not actually indicate an issue with your code. You can safely ignore this error for now.

However, if you want to get rid of the error, you can try updating your Rust toolchain and rust-analyzer to the latest versions. If that doesn't work, you can try disabling rust-analyzer's macro expansion feature by adding the following line to your `settings.json` file in VS Code:
```
"rust-analyzer.procMacro.enable": false
```
This will disable macro expansion in rust-analyzer and should get rid of the error.
