You can use the `pip` package to check the latest version of a package and compare it with the installed version. Here's a function `checkVersion` that takes the package name as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the package is up-to-date or not:

```python
import pip

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the latest version of the package from PyPI
    latest_version = str(pip.get_installed_distributions()[0]).split(' ')[1]
    # Get the installed version of the package
    installed_version = str(pip.get_installed_distributions(local_only=True)[0]).split(' ')[1]
    # Compare the versions and return True if the package is up-to-date
    return latest_version == installed_version
```

You can call this function with the package name as an argument to check if it's up-to-date or not. For example:

```python
if checkVersion('gekko'):
    print('gekko is up-to-date')
else:
    print('gekko is not up-to-date')
```
