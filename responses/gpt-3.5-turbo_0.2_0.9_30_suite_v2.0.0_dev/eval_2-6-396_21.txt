The error message is telling you that you cannot use the `Gender` property as a regular property on the `User` entity because it is already configured as a navigation property in the `OnModelCreating` method. 

To fix this issue, you can remove the `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` line from the `OnModelCreating` method. This line is trying to create an index on the `Gender` property, which is not allowed because it is already a navigation property.

Your updated `OnModelCreating` method should look like this:
```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);
    }
}
```

After making this change, you should be able to run the `dotnet ef add migration User` command without any errors.
