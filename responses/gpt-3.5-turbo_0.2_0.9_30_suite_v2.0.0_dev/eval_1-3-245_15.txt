It seems like the Dockerfile is not able to find the `app` module. You can try changing the `COPY` command in the Dockerfile to:

```
COPY ./fastapi/app /app
```

This will copy the `app` directory from the `fastapi` directory to the `/app` directory in the Docker container.

Also, make sure that the `requirements.txt` file is in the `fastapi` directory and not in the `app` directory. If it is in the `app` directory, you will need to change the `COPY` command to:

```
COPY ./fastapi /app
```

After making these changes, rebuild the Docker image using the command:

```
docker-compose build
```

And then start the container using:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This should resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` issue.
