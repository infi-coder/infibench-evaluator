Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly indicates that the class has a dependency on another class, and it ensures that the dependency is satisfied before the class is used. Additionally, it allows for the class to be immutable, which can be beneficial for testing and thread-safety. However, if you prefer to use constructor injection without `@Autowired`, that is also a valid approach.
