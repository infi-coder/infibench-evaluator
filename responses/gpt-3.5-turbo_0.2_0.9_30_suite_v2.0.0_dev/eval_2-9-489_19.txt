This warning is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled, which means that your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone without authentication. To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch security.

Here are the steps to enable Elasticsearch security:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` in your Rails app.

2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:

```
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning should disappear. If you still see the warning, you may need to update your Searchkick configuration to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.

Note: If you're using Elasticsearch version 7.13.1 or later, you'll need to use the `xpack.security` settings instead of the `security` settings.
