You can use the Windows API function `SHGetKnownFolderPath` to retrieve the local path of the OneDrive folder. Here's an example code snippet:

```
Private Declare PtrSafe Function SHGetKnownFolderPath Lib "shell32.dll" (ByRef rfid As Any, ByVal dwFlags As Long, ByVal hToken As LongPtr, ByRef pszPath As Any) As Long

Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrive = "{A52BBA46-E9E1-435f-B3D9-28DAA648C0F6}"
Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro = "{7C9D8867-D853-4E60-841E-AB360140D6F4}"

Sub GetOneDriveLocalPath()
    Dim path As String
    Dim result As Long
    
    result = SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_SkyDrive, 0, 0, path)
    If result <> 0 Then
        result = SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro, 0, 0, path)
    End If
    
    If result = 0 Then
        MsgBox path
    Else
        MsgBox "Failed to retrieve OneDrive local path."
    End If
End Sub
```

This code will retrieve the local path of the OneDrive folder and display it in a message box. You can modify it to suit your needs.
