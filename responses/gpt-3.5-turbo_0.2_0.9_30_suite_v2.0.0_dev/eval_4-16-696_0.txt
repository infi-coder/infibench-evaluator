You can try using the `rename` command instead of `mv` to rename the files. Here's an example command that should work for your case:

```
find . -type f -name '*\?*' -exec rename 's/\?.*//' {} \;
```

This command will find all files with a question mark in their name, and rename them by removing the question mark and everything after it.
