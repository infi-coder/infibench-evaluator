Yes, in Flutter you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw a vertical line between components. 

Here's an example:

```
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        height: 100,
        color: Colors.blue,
      ),
    ),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        height: 100,
        color: Colors.red,
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a `Row` widget is used to display two `Container` widgets with a vertical line between them. The `VerticalDivider` widget is used to draw the line, and you can customize its appearance using the `color`, `thickness`, and `width` properties.
