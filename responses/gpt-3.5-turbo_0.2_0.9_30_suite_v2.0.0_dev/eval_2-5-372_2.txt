It seems that there is a version conflict between the Hibernate Validator version that is included in your Spring Boot parent pom and the version that is resolved by Maven. 

You can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from your Spring Boot parent pom and add the desired version as a direct dependency in your pom.xml file. 

To do this, add the following to your pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

Then, exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from your Spring Boot parent pom by adding the following to your pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.4.RELEASE</version>
    <relativePath/>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

This should resolve the version conflict and allow you to use the @NotEmpty and @NotBlank annotations without errors.
