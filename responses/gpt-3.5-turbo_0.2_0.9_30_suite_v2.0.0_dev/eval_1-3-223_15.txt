You can use the `pip` module in Python to check if a package is at its latest version. Here's an implementation of the `checkVersion` function that takes the package name as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the package is at its latest version or not:

```python
import pip

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the installed version of the package
    installed_version = None
    for dist in pip.get_installed_distributions():
        if dist.project_name.lower() == pkgName.lower():
            installed_version = dist.version
            break

    # Get the latest version of the package available on PyPI
    latest_version = None
    try:
        package_info = pip.get_installed_distributions(pkgName)
        latest_version = package_info[0].version
    except:
        pass

    # Compare the installed version with the latest version
    if installed_version and latest_version:
        return installed_version == latest_version
    else:
        return False
```

Here's how you can use the `checkVersion` function:

```python
pkgName = 'gekko'
is_latest_version = checkVersion(pkgName)
print(is_latest_version)
```

This will print `True` if the package is at its latest version, and `False` otherwise.
