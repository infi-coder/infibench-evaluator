The code you provided looks correct. However, it's possible that the code is not working because the user has not granted permission to access their location. In this case, the `getCurrentPosition` method will fail silently and the `else` block will not be executed.

To handle this case, you can add an error callback to the `getCurrentPosition` method to log the error message. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

With this code, if the user denies permission to access their location, the error callback will be executed and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console.
