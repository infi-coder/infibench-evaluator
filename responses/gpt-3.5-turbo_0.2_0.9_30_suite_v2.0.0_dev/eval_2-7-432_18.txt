The error message "419 Page Expired" usually occurs when the CSRF token expires. This token is used to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. 

To avoid this error message, you can try the following solutions:

1. Use a different browser or incognito mode: When you open a new tab in the same browser, it may use the same session and CSRF token. Using a different browser or incognito mode can create a new session and CSRF token.

2. Use a different token for each tab: You can modify the logout link to include a unique token for each tab. This way, when you logout from one tab, it won't affect the other tabs. Here's an example:

   ```
   <a href="{{ route('logout') }}?token={{ uniqid() }}">Logout</a>
   ```

   This will generate a unique token for each logout link.

3. Increase the CSRF token lifetime: By default, the CSRF token lifetime is set to 120 minutes. You can increase this value in the `App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken` middleware. Here's an example:

   ```
   protected $addHttpCookie = true;
   protected $except = [
       //
   ];
   protected $csrfTokenLifetime = 1440; // 24 hours
   ```

   This will increase the CSRF token lifetime to 24 hours.

I hope one of these solutions will work for you.
