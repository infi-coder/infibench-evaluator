For the first issue with the "CSRF token mismatch" error, it seems like the issue could be related to the session driver configuration on the host domain. You mentioned that multiple sessions are being generated for one user, which could indicate that the session driver is not properly configured to handle sessions across multiple requests. You may want to try changing the session driver to a different option, such as database or redis, to see if that resolves the issue.

For the second issue with the email configuration, it looks like the error message is indicating that the SSL version being used is incorrect. You have specified "ssl" as the encryption type in your .env file, but in your mail.php file, you have set the encryption to use the value of the MAIL_ENCRYPTION environment variable, which is "tls" by default. You may want to try changing the encryption type to "tls" in your .env file and see if that resolves the issue. Additionally, you may want to check with your client to confirm the correct SMTP settings for their server, as it's possible that the port or encryption type may be different than what you have configured.
