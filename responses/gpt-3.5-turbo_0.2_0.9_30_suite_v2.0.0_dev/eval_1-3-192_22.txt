Here's a possible implementation of the `to_camel_case` function in Python:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r"[_-]", text)
    return words[0] + "".join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function first checks if the input string is empty, and returns an empty string in that case. It then splits the input string into words using a regular expression that matches either underscores or dashes as delimiters. The first word is left as is, and the remaining words are capitalized and concatenated together. The resulting string is the camel case version of the input string.

You will also need to import the `re` module at the beginning of your code to use regular expressions.
