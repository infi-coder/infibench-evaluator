It seems like the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` only, which means it won't be accessible from outside the container. To fix this, you need to tell Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0`, which will make it accessible from any IP address.

To do this, you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0' // Add this line
    }
})
```

This will tell Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`.

Once you've made this change, rebuild your Docker image and run the container again. You should now be able to access the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.

Also, make sure that your firewall is not blocking the port. You can check this by running `sudo ufw status` on your host machine. If the firewall is enabled, you may need to add a rule to allow incoming traffic on port 8080.
