You can use the following command to restart your current terminal session without closing the window on MacOS:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This will reload your updated `.bash_profile` file and apply any changes you made to it, including your new prompt and aliases. 

Alternatively, you can use the following command to reload your current shell:

```
exec $SHELL
```

This will also reload your `.bash_profile` file and apply any changes you made to it.
