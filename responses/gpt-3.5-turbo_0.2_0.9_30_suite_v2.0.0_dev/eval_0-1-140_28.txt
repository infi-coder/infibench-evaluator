With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for using icons in CSS has changed. You need to use the `font-family` property with the value `"Font Awesome 5 Free"` or `"Font Awesome 5 Pro"` instead of `"FontAwesome"`. Additionally, you need to use the `content` property with the value `"\\f107"` instead of `"\f107"`. Here's the updated code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

Note that you may need to adjust the `font-weight` property as well, depending on which style of icon you are using (solid, regular, light, etc.).
