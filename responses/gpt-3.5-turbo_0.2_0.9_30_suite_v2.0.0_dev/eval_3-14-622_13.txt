To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to define a `fill` method that takes a `ContentShape` and a `View` as parameters and returns a `View`. Here's an example implementation for your `RedView`:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(Color.red)
    }
}
```

Then, you can use it like this:

```
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedView())
    }
}
```
