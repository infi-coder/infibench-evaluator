Yes, you can use the `pd.date_range()` function to create a range of dates for the entire year and then count the number of days in that range. Here's an example function `DaysInYear` that takes a year as an argument and returns the total number of days in that year:

```python
import pandas as pd

def DaysInYear(year):
    start_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-01-01')
    end_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-12-31')
    days_in_year = (end_date - start_date).days + 1
    return days_in_year
```

This function first creates a `start_date` and `end_date` using the `pd.to_datetime()` function. It then calculates the number of days between these two dates using the `.days` attribute of the resulting `Timedelta` object. Finally, it adds 1 to the result to include the last day of the year.
