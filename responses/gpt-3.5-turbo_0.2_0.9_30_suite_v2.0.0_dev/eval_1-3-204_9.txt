The issue with your code is that the `rename()` method is not applicable to a Pandas Series object, which is what you get when you call `.mean()` on a DataFrame column. Instead, you can use the `to_frame()` method to convert the Series to a DataFrame, and then use `rename()` to rename the column.

Here's the modified code that should work:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().to_frame().rename(columns={"p": "mean"})
    return avg
```

In this function, we first create a DataFrame `df` with the given column names. Then we group the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column. The result is a Pandas Series object, which we convert to a DataFrame using the `to_frame()` method. Finally, we use the `rename()` method to rename the column from "p" to "mean". The resulting DataFrame is returned by the function.
