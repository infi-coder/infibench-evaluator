This error occurs because pdftk is a 32-bit application and Catalina only supports 64-bit applications. Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. Use an alternative tool: Since pdftk is no longer supported on Catalina, you can use an alternative tool such as PDFsam or qpdf.

2. Use a virtual machine: You can use a virtual machine to run an older version of MacOS that supports 32-bit applications. You can then install pdftk on the virtual machine and use it from there.

3. Use Docker: You can use Docker to run pdftk in a container. This will allow you to use pdftk on Catalina without any issues.

4. Compile pdftk from source: You can download the source code for pdftk and compile it on your Mac. This will create a 64-bit version of pdftk that can be used on Catalina.

I hope one of these solutions works for you!
