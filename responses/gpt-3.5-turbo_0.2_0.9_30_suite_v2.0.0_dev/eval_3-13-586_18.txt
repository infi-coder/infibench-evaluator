The error message indicates that when creating a PendingIntent, you need to specify one of the flags FLAG_IMMUTABLE or FLAG_MUTABLE. As the error message suggests, you can use FLAG_IMMUTABLE unless you need the PendingIntent to be mutable for some specific functionality.

In your case, you can modify the code that creates the PendingIntent to include the FLAG_IMMUTABLE flag. You can do this by replacing the line:

```
mbrIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context,
    0/* requestCode, ignored */, mediaButtonIntent,
    PENDING_INTENT_FLAG_MUTABLE);
```

with:

```
mbrIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context,
    0/* requestCode, ignored */, mediaButtonIntent,
    PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE);
```

This should resolve the issue and allow your application to target Android SDK 31.
