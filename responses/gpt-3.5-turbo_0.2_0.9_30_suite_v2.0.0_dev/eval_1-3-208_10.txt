The issue with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is present in the `correct` string, which is not what you want. Instead, you should check if all characters in the input string are present in the `correct` string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    for char in text:
        if char not in correct:
            return False
    return True
```

This function takes a string `text` as input and checks if all characters in the string are either letters (uppercase or lowercase) or digits. If any character is not in this set, the function returns `False`. If all characters are in the set, the function returns `True`.

You can call this function with the input string as follows:

```python
text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
``` 

This will print "Success" if the input string contains only letters and digits, and "Failure" otherwise.
