Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Type the following command to convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key:
```
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
3. You will be prompted to enter your passphrase (if you have one). Enter it and press Enter.
4. You will then be prompted to enter a new passphrase (if you want to change it). You can also press Enter to keep the same passphrase.
5. Your OpenSSH private key will now be converted to an RSA private key and saved in the same location with the filename `id_rsa`. The header will now be `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

As for your second question, you do not need to transfer your `id_rsa.pub` file as it is just the public key and does not contain any private information. You can continue to use the same `id_rsa.pub` file to access the server.
