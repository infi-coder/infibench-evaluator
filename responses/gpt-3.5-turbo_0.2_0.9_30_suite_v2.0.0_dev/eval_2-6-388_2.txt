The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0, so you need to make sure that you are using EF Core 5.0 or later in your project. 

To check the version of EF Core in your project, you can open the NuGet Package Manager and look for the version of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package. If it's not 5.0 or later, you can update it to the latest version by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```
Update-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
```

After updating to EF Core 5.0 or later, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class.
