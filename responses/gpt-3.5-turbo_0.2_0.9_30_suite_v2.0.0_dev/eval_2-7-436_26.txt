Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You need to make sure that your PHP version is compatible with Laravel 9.

You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -v
```

If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you need to upgrade your PHP version. You can follow the instructions on the official PHP website to upgrade your PHP version.

Once you have upgraded your PHP version, you can try running the `composer create-project` command again to install Laravel 9.
