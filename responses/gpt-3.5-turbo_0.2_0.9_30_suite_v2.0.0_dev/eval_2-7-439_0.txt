The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -m | grep zip
   ```

   If the output contains `zip`, then the extension is already installed.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The method of installation depends on your operating system and PHP version. Here are some examples:

   - For Ubuntu with PHP 7.4, run the following command:

     ```
     sudo apt-get install php7.4-zip
     ```

   - For CentOS with PHP 7.4, run the following command:

     ```
     sudo yum install php74-php-zip
     ```

   - For macOS with PHP 7.4 installed via Homebrew, run the following command:

     ```
     brew install php@7.4
     brew install php@7.4-zip
     ```

3. After installing the extension, restart your web server and try running your PHPStorm command again.
