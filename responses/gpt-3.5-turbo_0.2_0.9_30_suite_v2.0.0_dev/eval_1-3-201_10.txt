One solution to this problem is to use multiprocessing instead of threading. Multiprocessing allows you to run multiple processes in parallel, which can be useful when dealing with infinite loops. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use multiprocessing:

```python
import multiprocessing as mp

def run_data_mining(database):
    dataMiningScript = fd.financeData(database, 1600)

def run_webpage(database):
    app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
    homepage = hp.homepage(database)
    homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
    homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()
    app.run_server(debug=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    database = db.dataBase()
    p1 = mp.Process(target=run_data_mining, args=(database,))
    p2 = mp.Process(target=run_webpage, args=(database,))
    p1.start()
    p2.start()
    p1.join()
    p2.join()
```

In this modified code, we define two functions `run_data_mining` and `run_webpage` that will be run in separate processes. We then create two `Process` objects `p1` and `p2` that will run these functions, passing the `database` object as an argument. We start both processes using the `start()` method, and then wait for them to finish using the `join()` method. This way, both processes will run in parallel and won't block each other.
