There are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Make sure that the `@EnableSwagger2WebMvc` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application configuration class. This annotation enables Swagger support for Spring MVC.

2. Check that the `@ComponentScan` annotation is scanning the package where your Swagger configuration class is located. This is necessary for Spring to find and load the Swagger configuration.

3. Verify that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` property is set correctly in your application.properties or application.yml file. By default, the Swagger UI is available at `/swagger-ui.html`, but you can customize this path by setting the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` property.

4. Check that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled` property is set to `true` in your application.properties or application.yml file. This property enables or disables the Swagger UI.

5. If you are using Spring Security, make sure that you have configured it to allow access to the Swagger UI endpoint. You can do this by adding a security configuration that permits access to the Swagger UI URL.

If none of these steps solve the issue, you can try to debug the application to see if there are any errors or exceptions being thrown during startup.
