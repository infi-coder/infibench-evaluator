You can use `grep` with a regular expression to match the `lang` attribute and extract its value. Here's an example command that should work for both cases:

```
curl -Ls yahoo.com | grep -oP 'lang="\K[^"]+' | head -1
```

This uses the `-o` option to only output the matching part of the line, and the `-P` option to enable Perl-compatible regular expressions. The regular expression `lang="\K[^"]+` matches the `lang` attribute followed by its value, and the `\K` discards the `lang="` part so that only the value is output. The `head -1` command is used to only output the first match.

Note that this assumes that the `lang` attribute is always enclosed in double quotes. If it's enclosed in single quotes or there are other attributes between the `lang` attribute and its value, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.
