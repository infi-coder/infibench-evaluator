You need to use the `toast()` method to show the toast. Here's an example:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast with the default settings. If you want to customize the toast, you can pass an options object to the `toast()` method. For example:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast({
  delay: 2000 // The toast will be shown for 2 seconds
}).toast('show');
```

Make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap and jQuery files in your HTML file.
