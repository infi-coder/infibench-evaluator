You need to add a `go_package` option to your proto file. This option specifies the Go package name and import path for the generated code. 

For example, you can add the following line to your proto file:

```go
option go_package = "github.com/your-username/your-repo/your-package-name";
```

Replace `github.com/your-username/your-repo/your-package-name` with the actual import path for your Go package.

Then, run the protoc command again with the `--go_out` flag and the `M` argument:

```bash
protoc --go_out=plugins=grpc,M<your-package-name>=github.com/your-username/your-repo/your-package-name:. simple.proto
```

Replace `<your-package-name>` with the actual name of your Go package.

This should generate the Go code for your proto file.
