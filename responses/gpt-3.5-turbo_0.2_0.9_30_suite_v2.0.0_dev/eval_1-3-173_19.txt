Yes, you can use the `date_range` function from Pandas to create a range of dates for the given year and then calculate the length of the range to get the total number of days in the year. Here's an example function `DaysInYear` that takes a year as an integer argument and returns the number of days in that year:

```python
import pandas as pd

def DaysInYear(year):
    start_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-01-01')
    end_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-12-31')
    days_in_year = len(pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date))
    return days_in_year
```

This function first creates a `start_date` and an `end_date` using the `to_datetime` function from Pandas. It then uses the `date_range` function to create a range of dates from the `start_date` to the `end_date`. Finally, it calculates the length of the range using the `len` function and returns the result as the number of days in the year. 

You can call this function with a year as an argument to get the number of days in that year. For example:

```python
print(DaysInYear(2020)) # Output: 366
print(DaysInYear(2019)) # Output: 365
```
