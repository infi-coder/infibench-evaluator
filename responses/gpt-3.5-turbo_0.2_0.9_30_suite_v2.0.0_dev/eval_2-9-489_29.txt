This warning message is related to Elasticsearch built-in security features not being enabled. Without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone. 

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch security features. Here are the steps to enable Elasticsearch security features:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` in your Rails app.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

```
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning message should disappear. 

Note: If you are using Elasticsearch version 7.8 or later, you need to install the X-Pack plugin to enable security features. You can install the X-Pack plugin by running the following command:

```
bin/elasticsearch-plugin install x-pack
```

If you are using a version of Elasticsearch earlier than 7.8, security features are included in the Elasticsearch distribution and you do not need to install any additional plugins.
