To disable the back button in Flutter when the user has reached the login page after logging out, you can use the `WillPopScope` widget. This widget allows you to intercept the back button press and handle it as you wish. 

To use `WillPopScope`, wrap your login page widget with it and set the `onWillPop` property to return `false`. This will prevent the user from going back to the previous page using the back button. 

Here's an example:

```
WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () async => false,
  child: LoginPage(),
)
```

Note that this will only disable the back button on Android devices. On iOS devices, the back button is typically handled by the system and cannot be disabled.
