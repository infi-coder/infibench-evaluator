The issue with your code is that the `rename()` method is used to rename the index or column labels of a DataFrame. In your case, you want to rename a specific column, which can be done using the `rename()` method on the DataFrame itself.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index().rename(columns={"p": "mean"})
    return avg
```

In this code, we first create the DataFrame `df` with the specified column names. Then, we group the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column. We reset the index to make the "t" column a regular column, and then rename the "p" column to "mean". Finally, we return the resulting DataFrame `avg`.

Note that I have assumed that the variable `datafile` is defined somewhere else in your code. If not, you can replace `datafile` with the actual file name or path.
