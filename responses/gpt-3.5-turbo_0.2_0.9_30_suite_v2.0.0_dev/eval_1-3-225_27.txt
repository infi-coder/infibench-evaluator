Here's the revised code for the `pig_latin` function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:].lower()
        startString = word[0].upper()
        pig_latin_words.append(endString + startString + 'ay')
    return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)
```

The main changes are:

- Instead of returning a single word, we append each pig Latin word to a list `pig_latin_words`.
- We split the word into two parts: the end string (everything after the first letter) and the start string (the first letter). We convert the end string to lowercase and the start string to uppercase.
- We append the end string, start string, and "ay" to create the pig Latin word.
- Finally, we join all the pig Latin words with spaces and return the resulting string.
