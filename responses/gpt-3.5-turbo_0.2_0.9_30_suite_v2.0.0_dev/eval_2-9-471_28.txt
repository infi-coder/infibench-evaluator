When you create a `.d.ts` file, TypeScript assumes that it is generated from a corresponding `.ts` or `.tsx` file. In your case, TypeScript is ignoring `index.d.ts` because it assumes that it is generated from `index.tsx`, which is more likely to be up to date. 

To fix this, you can rename `index.d.ts` to something else, e.g., `declaration.d.ts`. Then, you can add `"include": ["./src/declaration.d.ts"]` to `tsconfig.json`. 

After that, you should be able to import the image in your component like this:

```
import * as React from 'react';
import image from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```

Note that you don't need to use `* as` when importing the image. Also, you should use `import image from` instead of `import * as image from`.
