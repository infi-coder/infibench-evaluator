To use the Swagger UI with Spring Boot, you need to configure the SpringDoc OpenAPI plugin in your application.

Here's an example of how to configure it in your Spring Boot application:

```java
@Configuration
public class OpenApiConfig {

    @Bean
    public OpenAPI customOpenAPI() {
        return new OpenAPI()
                .info(new Info()
                        .title("Your API Title")
                        .version("1.0.0")
                        .description("Your API description"));
    }
}
```

Make sure to replace "Your API Title" and "Your API description" with your own values.

Also, make sure that your Spring Boot application has the following annotation:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class YourApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(YourApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

With these configurations in place, you should be able to access the Swagger UI at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.
