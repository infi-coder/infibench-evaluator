- Pressable and TouchableOpacity have the same basic functionalities. They both are for making a text/image tappable.

- Pressable has some new props, like `android_disableSound` which you can use to define how far a touch can register away from the the wrapped element.

- On the other hand, TouchableOpacity also have some unique functionalities. For example, TouchableOpacity has automatic opacity change, where with Pressable you need to add your own custom opacity with Pressable's `style` prop. Furthermore, TouchableOpacity adds the fade-out animation on press. 

In general, if you need a simple tappable component, either Pressable or TouchableOpacity can be used. However, if you need more customization options or specific animations, you may want to choose one over the other. Additionally, if you are building a mobile app, TouchableOpacity may be a better choice as it has been around for longer and is more widely used.
