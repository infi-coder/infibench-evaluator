The error message suggests that the response from the server is not in the expected JSON format. It looks like the response starts with a '<' character, which indicates that it might be an HTML error page instead of a JSON response.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the URL of the API endpoint. Make sure it is correct and matches the route defined in the controller.

2. Test the API endpoint using a tool like Postman or curl to see if it returns the expected JSON response.

3. If the API endpoint is working correctly, check if there are any errors in the Blazor code that might be causing the issue. For example, make sure that the HttpClient is configured correctly and that the response is being parsed correctly.

4. If you are still unable to resolve the issue, you can try adding some logging statements to the Blazor code to see what is happening. For example, you can log the response from the server to see if it is in the expected format.

Here is an updated version of the Blazor code that logs the response from the server:

```c#
@page "/fetchemployee"
@inject HttpClient Http
@using System.Net.Http.Json

<h1>Employee Details</h1>

@if (empList == null)
{
    <p><em>Loading...</em></p>
}
else
{
    <table class='table'>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Employee ID</th>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Gender</th>
                <th>Department</th>
                <th>City</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            @foreach (var emp in empList)
            {
                <tr>
                    <td>@emp.EmployeeID</td>
                    <td>@emp.Name</td>
                    <td>@emp.Gender</td>
                    <td>@emp.Department</td>
                    <td>@emp.City</td>
                </tr>
            }
        </tbody>
    </table>
}

@code {
    private Employee[] empList;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        try
        {
            empList = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<Employee[]>("/api/Employee/Index");
            Console.WriteLine("Response from server: " + JsonSerializer.Serialize(empList));
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message
