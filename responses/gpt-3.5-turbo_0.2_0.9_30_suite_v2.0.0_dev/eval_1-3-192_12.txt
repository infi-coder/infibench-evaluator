Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r'[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function first checks if the input string is empty or not. If it's empty, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it splits the string into words using the regular expression `[-_]`. It then capitalizes the first letter of each word except the first word and joins them together to form the camel case string.

You will also need to import the `re` module at the beginning of your code to use the `re.split()` function.
