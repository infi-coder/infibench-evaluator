You can use the `--output` parameter to set the output format to `json` and then pipe the output to `/dev/null` to discard it. This will prevent the pager from opening up and interrupting your script. Here's an example:

```
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo --output json >/dev/null; 
done
```

This will send the output to `/dev/null` instead of displaying it on the screen. You can also redirect the output to a file if you want to save it for later analysis.
