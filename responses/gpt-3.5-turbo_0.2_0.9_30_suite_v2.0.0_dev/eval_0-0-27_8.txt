It seems like you are trying to fetch data from a GraphQL API that is not working properly. The `uri` you are using in your `ApolloClient` configuration is not responding, which is causing the `useQuery` hook to hang at the `loading` state.

You can try using a different GraphQL API to test your code. Here are a few options:

- [GraphQL Pokemon API](https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/)
- [GraphQL Star Wars API](https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index)
- [GraphQL Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql)

Replace the `uri` in your `ApolloClient` configuration with one of the above APIs and see if it works. If it does, then the issue was with the original API you were using.
