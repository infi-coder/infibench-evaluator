It seems like the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost`, which means that it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0`, which will allow it to accept connections from any IP address.

To do this, you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0' // Add this line
    }
})
```

This will bind the Vite server to `0.0.0.0`, which should allow you to access it from outside the Docker container.

Also, make sure that you are running the `npm run vite` command inside the Docker container and not on your local machine.
