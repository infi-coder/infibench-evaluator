You need to add two things to your `~/.zshenv`. First, add the rbenv initialization itself by adding the line `eval "$(rbenv init -)"`. Second, add the path to the ruby binaries by adding the line `export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"`. 

To check your installation, you might also run the command `rbenv doctor`. This will check if your rbenv installation is working correctly and if there are any issues with your configuration.
