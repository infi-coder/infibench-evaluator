To disable the back button in Flutter when the user has reached the login page after logging out, you can use the `WillPopScope` widget. Wrap your login page widget with `WillPopScope` and set its `onWillPop` property to return a `Future.value(false)`. This will prevent the user from going back to the previous page using the back button or any other means.

Here's an example:

```
WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () => Future.value(false),
  child: LoginPage(),
)
```

Note that this will only prevent the user from going back to the previous page. If the user closes the app and reopens it, they will still be logged out. To handle this case, you can use a state management solution like `Provider` or `Bloc` to keep track of the user's authentication status and redirect them to the appropriate page when the app is reopened.
