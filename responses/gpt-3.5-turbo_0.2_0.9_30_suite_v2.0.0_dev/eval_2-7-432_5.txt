The error message "419 Page Expired" usually occurs when the CSRF token expires. This can happen when the user stays on a page for too long before submitting a form or when the user has multiple tabs open with the same session.

To avoid this error message, you can add a check in your logout function to see if the CSRF token has expired. If it has, you can regenerate a new CSRF token and then log the user out.

Here's an example of how you can do this in Laravel:

```
public function logout(Request $request)
{
    if ($request->session()->regenerateToken()) {
        Auth::logout();
        $request->session()->invalidate();
        return redirect('/');
    }
}
```

This code regenerates the CSRF token and then logs the user out. If the CSRF token cannot be regenerated, the user is not logged out and an error message is displayed.

By doing this, you can ensure that the user is always logged out, even if the CSRF token has expired.
