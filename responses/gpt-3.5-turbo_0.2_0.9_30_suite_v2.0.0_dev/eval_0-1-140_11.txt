With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for using icons has changed. You need to use the `font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"` property instead of `font-family: "FontAwesome"`. Also, the syntax for using icons has changed from `\f107` to `content: "\f107";` to `content: "\f107"; font-weight: 900;`. So, the updated code should be:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

Make sure that you have included the Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project.
