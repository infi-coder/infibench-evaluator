You can specify the Java version to use with the Maven wrapper by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of the desired JDK installation. 

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Locate the path of the JDK installation that works with the Maven task. This can typically be found in the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable on the machine where the Maven task is running.

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of the JDK installation. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/jdk` with the actual path to the JDK installation.

3. Run the Maven wrapper command as usual. It should now use the specified JDK version.

Alternatively, you can also specify the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable directly in the Maven wrapper command by adding the `-Dmaven.compiler.fork=true -Dmaven.compiler.executable=/path/to/jdk/bin/javac` options. 

For example:

```
./mvnw -Dmaven.compiler.fork=true -Dmaven.compiler.executable=/path/to/jdk/bin/javac clean install
```

Replace `/path/to/jdk` with the actual path to the JDK installation.
