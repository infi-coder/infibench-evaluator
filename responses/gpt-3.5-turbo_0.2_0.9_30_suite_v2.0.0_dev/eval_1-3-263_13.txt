The `f` before the opening quotation mark indicates that this is an f-string, which is a feature introduced in Python 3.6. 

An f-string is a string literal that is prefixed with an `f` or `F`. It allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`. The expressions inside the curly braces are evaluated at runtime and their values are inserted into the string.

In your example, the expressions inside the curly braces are `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory`. These expressions are evaluated at runtime and their values are inserted into the string. The resulting string is then printed to the console.

For example, if `args.input_directory` is `"input"` and `args.output_directory` is `"output"`, the output of the two print statements would be:

```
Input directory: input
Output directory: output
```
