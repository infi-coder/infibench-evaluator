This error occurs because IntelliJ IDEA is using an older version of Maven than the one used to generate the project. To fix this error, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Maven settings in IntelliJ IDEA by going to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.
2. Check the "Use plugin registry" option.
3. Click on the "Apply" button to save the changes.
4. Re-import the Maven project by going to File > New > Project from Existing Sources and selecting the pom.xml file of the project.
5. Wait for the project to be imported and built.

If the above steps do not work, you can try updating the Maven version used by IntelliJ IDEA to match the one used to generate the project. To do this, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of Maven from the official website.
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a directory on your computer.
3. Open the Maven settings in IntelliJ IDEA by going to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.
4. Click on the "Add" button and select the directory where you extracted Maven.
5. Click on the "Apply" button to save the changes.
6. Re-import the Maven project by going to File > New > Project from Existing Sources and selecting the pom.xml file of the project.
7. Wait for the project to be imported and built.

These steps should help you resolve the error and successfully import the project into IntelliJ IDEA.
