It seems like ESLint is unable to find your `tsconfig.json` file. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project.

2. In your `.eslintrc.js` file, update the `parserOptions` property to include the `tsconfigRootDir` property. This property tells ESLint where to find the `tsconfig.json` file.

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./tsconfig.json",
  tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

3. If the above step does not work, try specifying the absolute path to the `tsconfig.json` file in the `parserOptions` property.

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "/absolute/path/to/tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

4. If the issue still persists, try installing the `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` package and update your `.eslintrc.js` file to use it.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  settings: {
    "import/resolver": {
      typescript: {},
    },
  },
};
```

I hope one of these steps helps you resolve the issue.
