Here's the bash script you can use to install Python 3.6.5 using brew:

```
brew install python@3.6
```

This will install the latest version of Python 3.6 available in brew. If you want to install a specific version, you can use the following command:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/<commit-hash>/Formula/python.rb
```

Replace `<commit-hash>` with the commit hash of the version you want to install. You can find the commit hash of a specific version in the Homebrew Core repository on GitHub.
