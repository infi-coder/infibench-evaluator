Sure! The code you provided is almost correct, but you need to use the `keyof` keyword to reference the union types `fruit` and `color`:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in keyof fruit]: number;
  [key in keyof color]: boolean;
};
```

This will create a type with a numeric property for each fruit and a boolean property for each color.
