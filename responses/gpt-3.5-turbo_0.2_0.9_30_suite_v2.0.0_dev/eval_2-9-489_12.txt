This warning message is related to Elasticsearch built-in security features that are not enabled. Without authentication, your cluster could be accessible to anyone. To fix this, you can enable Elasticsearch security features by following these steps:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file located at `config/elasticsearch.yml`.

2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:
```
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning message should disappear. If you still see the warning message, you may need to update your Searchkick configuration to use the correct Elasticsearch URL and credentials. You can refer to the Searchkick documentation for more information on how to configure Elasticsearch with Searchkick.
