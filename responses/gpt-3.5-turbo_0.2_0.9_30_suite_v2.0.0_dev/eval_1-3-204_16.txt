The issue with your code is that the `rename()` method is used to rename the index or column labels of a DataFrame, not to rename a specific column. To rename a specific column, you can simply assign a new name to the column using the `rename()` method on the DataFrame.

Here's the modified code that should work:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().rename("mean")
    df["mean"] = avg
    df = df.drop("p", axis=1)
    return df
```

In this code, we first group the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column. We then rename the resulting Series to "mean". Finally, we assign the "mean" column to the DataFrame and drop the original "p" column.

Note that the `axis=1` argument in the `drop()` method specifies that we want to drop a column, not a row.
