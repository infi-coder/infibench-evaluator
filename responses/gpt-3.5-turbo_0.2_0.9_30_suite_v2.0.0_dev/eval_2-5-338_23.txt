The error message suggests that Jackson (the JSON serialization library used by Spring) is unable to serialize the `ByteArrayInputStream` object that is part of the `MultipartFile` object. 

To solve this, you can configure Jackson to ignore the `ByteArrayInputStream` property by adding the following line to your application configuration:

```java
spring.jackson.serialization.FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS=false
```

Alternatively, you can exclude the `ByteArrayInputStream` property from serialization by annotating the `MultipartFile` field with `@JsonIgnore`:

```java
@JsonIgnore
private MultipartFile circularAttachment;
```

This will prevent Jackson from attempting to serialize the `ByteArrayInputStream` property and should resolve the error.
