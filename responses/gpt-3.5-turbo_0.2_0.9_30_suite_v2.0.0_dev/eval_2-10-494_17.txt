This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, which is a language server for Rust that provides IDE-like features such as code completion and error highlighting. The error message is indicating that rust-analyzer is having trouble resolving the `format_args` macro, which is used internally by the `pad_str` function.

Fortunately, this error does not indicate a problem with your code, and you can safely ignore it. If your code compiles and passes tests, then it is working correctly.

If the error message is bothering you, you can try updating rust-analyzer to the latest version, or disabling it entirely. To disable rust-analyzer in VS Code, you can add the following line to your settings.json file:

```json
"rust-analyzer.enable": false
```

This will disable rust-analyzer for all Rust projects in VS Code.
