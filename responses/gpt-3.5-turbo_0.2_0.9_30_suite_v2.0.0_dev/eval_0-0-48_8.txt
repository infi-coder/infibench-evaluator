Sure! The code you provided is almost correct, but you need to use the `|` operator instead of `,` when defining the type `FruitsAndColors`. Here's the corrected code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit | color]: key extends fruit ? number : boolean
}
```

This code creates a mapped type that iterates over each key in the union of `fruit` and `color`. For each key, it checks whether it extends `fruit` or `color`. If it extends `fruit`, the corresponding property in `FruitsAndColors` is assigned the type `number`. Otherwise, it is assigned the type `boolean`.
