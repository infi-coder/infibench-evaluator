The issue might be that `ContentView` is not being updated when `isSelected` changes. Try wrapping the `Text` view in a `VStack` and adding a `Spacer` to fill the remaining space. This should force the view to update when `isSelected` changes. Here's the modified code:

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @Binding var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button(action: {
                self.isSelected.toggle()
            }) {
                Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
            }
            Spacer()
        }
    }
}
```
