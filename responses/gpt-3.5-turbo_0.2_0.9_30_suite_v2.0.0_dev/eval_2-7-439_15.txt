The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed by running `php -m | grep zip`. If you see `zip` in the output, then the extension is already installed.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The method for doing this depends on your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install php-zip` to install the extension.

3. Once the extension is installed, restart your web server (e.g. Apache or Nginx) and try running your PHP script again.

If you are still having issues, make sure that the extension is enabled in your `php.ini` file. You can check this by running `php -i | grep zip`. If you see `zip` in the output, then the extension is enabled. If not, you need to add the following line to your `php.ini` file:

```
extension=zip.so
```

Make sure to restart your web server after making changes to the `php.ini` file.
