It seems that the Dockerfile is unable to find the `app` module. You can try changing the `COPY` command in your Dockerfile to:

```
COPY ./fastapi/app /app
```

This will copy the `app` directory inside the `fastapi` directory to the `/app` directory in the Docker container.

Your revised Dockerfile should look like this:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /
RUN pip install --requirement /requirements.txt

COPY ./fastapi/app /app

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

After making this change, rebuild your Docker image and try running it again using `docker-compose up -d`.
