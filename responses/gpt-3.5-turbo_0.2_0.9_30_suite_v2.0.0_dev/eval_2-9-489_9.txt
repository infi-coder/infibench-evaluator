The warning message is indicating that Elasticsearch built-in security features are not enabled and your cluster could be accessible to anyone. To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch security features.

Here are the steps to enable Elasticsearch security features:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` located in the `config` directory of your Rails app.

2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:

```
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning message should disappear. If you still see the warning message, you may need to update your Searchkick gem to a version that supports Elasticsearch 7.13.1.
