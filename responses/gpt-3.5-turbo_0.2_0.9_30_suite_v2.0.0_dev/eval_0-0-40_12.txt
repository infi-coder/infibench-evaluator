It seems like there is an issue with the line endings in the npm executable file. You can try the following steps to fix the issue:

1. Open the npm executable file in a text editor using the command `sudo nano /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm`.

2. Convert the line endings from Windows (CRLF) to Unix (LF) using the command `dos2unix /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm`.

3. Save the file and exit the text editor.

4. Try running the `npm -v` command again.

If the above steps do not work, you can try reinstalling npm using the command `sudo apt-get install -y npm`.
