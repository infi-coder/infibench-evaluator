The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` suggests that the package `aws-sdk-js` cannot be found in the npm registry. This could be due to a temporary issue with the registry or a problem with your internet connection.

You can try running `npm cache clean` to clear the npm cache and then run `npm install` again. If that doesn't work, you can try specifying a specific version of the package by running `npm install aws-sdk-js@2.0.0` (replace `2.0.0` with the version you want to install).

If the issue persists, you can try switching to a different npm registry by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/` and then running `npm install` again.
