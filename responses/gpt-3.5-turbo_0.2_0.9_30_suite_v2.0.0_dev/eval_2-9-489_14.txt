This warning is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled, which could potentially make your cluster accessible to anyone. To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch security features.

Here are the steps to enable Elasticsearch security features:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` in your Rails app.

2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:

```
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning should disappear. If you still see the warning, you may need to check your Elasticsearch version and ensure that it supports security features.

Note: If you're using a version of Elasticsearch prior to 7.8, you'll need to install the X-Pack plugin to enable security features.
