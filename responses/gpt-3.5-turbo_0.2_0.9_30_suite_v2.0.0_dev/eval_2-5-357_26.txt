Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly shows the dependencies that are required for the class to function properly. Also, it ensures that the required dependencies are available at the time of object creation. 

However, if you are using Spring 4.3 or later versions, you can omit the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor if the class has only one constructor. Spring will automatically inject the dependencies based on the type of the constructor arguments.
