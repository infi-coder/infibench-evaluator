Here's the revised code for the `pig_latin` function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        pig_latin_word = word[1:].lower() + word[0].lower() + "ay"
        pig_latin_words.append(pig_latin_word)
    return " ".join(pig_latin_words)
```

In this revised code, we first split the input text into individual words using the `split()` method. Then, we loop through each word and create a new pig Latin word by moving the first character to the end, converting the rest of the word to lowercase, and appending "ay" to the end. We then add the pig Latin word to a list of pig Latin words.

Finally, we join the list of pig Latin words back into a string using the `join()` method and return the result.

Note that we also changed the variable names to be more descriptive and removed the unnecessary `say` variable.
