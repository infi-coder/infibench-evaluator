The issue is that you are missing a comma after the color value of the "primary" key in your `$theme-colors` map. Here's the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here,
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace `#your-color-here` with the actual color value you want to use for the primary color.

Also, make sure you have installed the required dependencies for compiling Sass. You can install them using npm by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install sass --save-dev
```

After that, you can compile your Sass file to CSS using the following command:

```
sass style.scss custom.css
```

This will create a `custom.css` file with your custom Bootstrap theme.
