It seems like the response from the server is not in the expected JSON format, which is causing the `System.Text.Json.JsonException`. 

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the response from the server using a tool like Postman or Fiddler. Make sure that the response is in the expected JSON format.

2. If the response is not in the expected format, you may need to modify your API controller to return the data in the correct format.

3. If the response is in the correct format, you can try using a different method to deserialize the JSON. For example, you can try using the `Newtonsoft.Json` library instead of `System.Text.Json`.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use `Newtonsoft.Json`:

1. Install the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.HttpClient` and `Newtonsoft.Json` packages.

2. Modify your code to use `HttpClient` and `Newtonsoft.Json`:

```c#
using Newtonsoft.Json;

...

private HttpClient httpClient;

...

protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
{
    httpClient = new HttpClient();

    var response = await httpClient.GetAsync("/api/Employee/Index");

    if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        var json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        var empList = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Employee[]>(json);
    }
}
```

This code uses `HttpClient` to make the request to the server and `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject` to deserialize the JSON response.
