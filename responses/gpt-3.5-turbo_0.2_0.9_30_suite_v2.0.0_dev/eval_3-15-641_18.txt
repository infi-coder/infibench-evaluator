You can use the Windows API to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. Here's some sample code:

```
Private Declare PtrSafe Function SHGetKnownFolderPath Lib "shell32.dll" (ByRef rfid As Any, ByVal dwFlags As Long, ByVal hToken As LongPtr, ByRef pszPath As Any) As Long

Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrive As String = "{A52BBA46-E9E1-435f-B3D9-28DAA648C0F6}"
Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro As String = "{7A3B0AD3-CD84-4E57-AD72-2F3D8507F596}"

Public Function GetOneDriveFolderPath() As String
    Dim path As String
    Dim hr As Long
    
    hr = SHGetKnownFolderPath(StrPtr(FOLDERID_SkyDrive), 0, 0, path)
    
    If hr <> 0 Then
        hr = SHGetKnownFolderPath(StrPtr(FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro), 0, 0, path)
    End If
    
    If hr = 0 Then
        GetOneDriveFolderPath = path
    Else
        GetOneDriveFolderPath = ""
    End If
End Function
```

This code uses the `SHGetKnownFolderPath` function to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. You can call this function from your VBA code to get the path and use it to create folders and files on OneDrive.
