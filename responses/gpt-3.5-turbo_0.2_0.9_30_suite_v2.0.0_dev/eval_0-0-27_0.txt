It seems that the issue is related to the URI you are using. The URI `https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io` is a public GraphQL API provided by Apollo, but it may not be working properly at the moment.

To fix the issue, you can try using a different GraphQL API or creating your own GraphQL server. Here are the steps to create a simple GraphQL server using Apollo Server:

1. Install the required packages:

   ```
   npm install apollo-server graphql
   ```

2. Create a new file named `server.js` and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');

   const typeDefs = gql`
     type Query {
       hello: String
     }
   `;

   const resolvers = {
     Query: {
       hello: () => 'Hello world!',
     },
   };

   const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

   server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
     console.log(`Server ready at ${url}`);
   });
   ```

   This code defines a simple GraphQL schema with a single query `hello` that returns the string "Hello world!".

3. Start the server by running the following command:

   ```
   node server.js
   ```

   This will start the server at `http://localhost:4000`.

4. Update the `uri` in `ApolloClient` to `http://localhost:4000`:

   ```javascript
   const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
     uri: 'http://localhost:4000',
     cache: new InMemoryCache(),
   });
   ```

   This will connect your Apollo Client to the GraphQL server running on your local machine.

After making these changes, you should be able to fetch data using `useQuery` without any issues.
