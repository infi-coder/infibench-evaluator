You can use `grep` with a regular expression to match the `lang` attribute regardless of its position in the HTML tag. Here's an example:

```
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -oP 'lang="\K[^"]+'
```

This will output `he-IL` for the example you provided. Here's how it works:

- `-o` tells `grep` to only output the matching part of the line
- `-P` tells `grep` to use Perl-compatible regular expressions
- `lang="\K` matches `lang="` but doesn't include it in the output (thanks to `\K`)
- `[^"]+` matches one or more characters that are not a double quote, which is the value of the `lang` attribute
