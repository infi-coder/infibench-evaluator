Yes, in Flutter you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here's an example of how to use it:

```
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        height: 100,
        color: Colors.blue,
      ),
    ),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        height: 100,
        color: Colors.green,
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a `Row` widget is used to display two `Container` widgets with a `VerticalDivider` in between. The `color` property of the `VerticalDivider` is set to grey, the `thickness` property is set to 1, and the `width` property is set to 20. This will create a vertical line that is 1 pixel thick and 20 pixels wide.
