The issue seems to be with the `uri` you are using in your `ApolloClient`. The `uri` you are using (`https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io`) is a sample GraphQL server provided by Apollo, and it may not be working properly at the moment.

You should replace the `uri` with the endpoint of your own GraphQL server. If you don't have a GraphQL server, you can create one using services like Apollo Server, Hasura, or AWS AppSync.

Once you have your own GraphQL server, replace the `uri` in your `ApolloClient` with the endpoint of your server, like this:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://your-graphql-server-endpoint.com/graphql',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

Make sure to replace `https://your-graphql-server-endpoint.com/graphql` with the actual endpoint of your GraphQL server.

Also, make sure that your GraphQL server is properly configured and running. You can test your GraphQL server using tools like GraphiQL or GraphQL Playground.
