The error message you are seeing is related to ESLint, which is a popular linting tool used to analyze code for potential errors and style issues. In your case, ESLint is trying to read your `tsconfig.json` file but is unable to find it, which is causing the error.

To fix this issue, you need to make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project. If it is already in the root directory, then you can try specifying the full path to the file in your `.eslintrc.js` file.

To specify the full path to your `tsconfig.json` file, you can modify the `parserOptions` section of your `.eslintrc.js` file as follows:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This assumes that your `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project. If it is located in a different directory, you will need to modify the path accordingly.

Once you have made this change, save the file and restart VSCode. The error message should no longer appear in your `.ts` files.
