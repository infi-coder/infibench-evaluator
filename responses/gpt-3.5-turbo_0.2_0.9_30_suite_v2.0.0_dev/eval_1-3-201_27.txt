You can use multiprocessing to run the two scripts simultaneously. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use multiprocessing:

```python
import multiprocessing

if __name__ == "__main__":
    database = db.dataBase()
    homepage = hp.homepage(database)
    homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
    homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
    dataMiningScript = fd.financeData(database, 1600)

    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()

    # Create two processes, one for each script
    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=dataMiningScript.run)
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=app.run_server, kwargs={"debug": True})

    # Start the processes
    p1.start()
    p2.start()

    # Wait for the processes to finish
    p1.join()
    p2.join()
```

In this example, we create two processes, one for `dataMiningScript` and one for `app.run_server()`. We start both processes and wait for them to finish using the `join()` method. Note that you may need to modify the `run()` method of `dataMiningScript` to include a loop that continuously updates the database.
