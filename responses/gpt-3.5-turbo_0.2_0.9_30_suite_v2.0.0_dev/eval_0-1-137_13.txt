The issue is that you are missing a comma after the value of the "primary" color. Here's the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here,
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace "#your-color-here" with the actual color value you want to use.

Also, make sure that you have installed Bootstrap's dependencies and are using the correct version of SASS. You can install Bootstrap's dependencies by running `npm install` in your project directory.
