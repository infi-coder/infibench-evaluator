You can use the `pip` module in Python to check if a package is at its latest version. Here's a function `checkVersion` that takes the package name as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the package is at its latest version or not:

```python
import pip

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the package information
    package_info = pip.get_installed_distributions()
    # Loop through the packages and check if the package is installed
    for package in package_info:
        if package.project_name.lower() == pkgName.lower():
            # Check if the package is at its latest version
            latest_version = pip.get_latest_version(pkgName)
            if package.version == latest_version:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    # If the package is not installed, return False
    return False
```

You can call this function with the package name as an argument, like this:

```python
result = checkVersion('gekko')
print(result)
```

This will print `True` if the package is at its latest version, and `False` otherwise.
