The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
```

If you are using Windows, you can download the pre-built binaries for zlib from the following link: https://www.zlib.net/

Once you have installed zlib, try installing Pillow again using pip:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

If the above steps do not work, you can try installing Pillow from a wheel file. Download the appropriate wheel file for your system from the following link: https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/#files

Then, install the wheel file using pip:

```bash
pip install path/to/wheel/file.whl
```

Replace `path/to/wheel/file.whl` with the actual path to the downloaded wheel file.
