With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for using icons has changed. You need to use the `font-weight` property instead of `font-family`. Here's how you can modify your code to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-weight: 900;
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

In this code, we are using the `font-weight` property to specify the weight of the icon. The value `900` corresponds to the solid style of the icon. We are also specifying the font family as `"Font Awesome 5 Free"`, which is the name of the font family for Font Awesome 5 icons.
