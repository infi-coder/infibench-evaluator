It seems that there might be a conflict between the version of Hibernate Validator that is included in your project and the one that is included in JBoss. The version that is included in your project is 6.0.11, while the one in JBoss is 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2.

To solve this issue, you can try excluding the Hibernate Validator dependency from your project and let JBoss provide it. To do this, add the following exclusion to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

This will exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from the spring-boot-starter-validation dependency. Then, you can add the following dependency to your pom.xml to use the version of Hibernate Validator that is included in JBoss:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.5.Final-redhat-2</version>
</dependency>
```

This should solve the conflict and allow you to use the @NotEmpty and @NotBlank annotations.
