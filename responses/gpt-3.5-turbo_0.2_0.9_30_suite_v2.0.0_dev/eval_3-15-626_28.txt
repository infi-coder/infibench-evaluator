You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate Power Query. Here is an example code snippet:

```
Sub RefreshPowerQuery()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections("Query - MyQueryName")
    conn.Refresh
End Sub
```

Replace "Query - MyQueryName" with the name of your Power Query. You can also modify this code to load the query results to a specific worksheet.
