With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for using icons has changed. You need to use the `font-weight` property instead of `font-family`. Here's how you can modify your code to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-weight: 900;
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

In this code, we're using the `font-weight` property to specify the weight of the icon. The value `900` corresponds to the solid style of the icon. We're also using the `font-family` property to specify the font family for Font Awesome 5. Note that the font family name is different from Font Awesome 4. 

Make sure that you have included the Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project and that the font files are in the correct location.
