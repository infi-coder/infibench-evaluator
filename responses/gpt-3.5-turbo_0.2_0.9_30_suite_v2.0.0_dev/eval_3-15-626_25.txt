You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate a Power Query. Here is an example code to load the query results to a worksheet:

```
Sub LoadPowerQueryToWorksheet()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Dim cmdText As String
    Dim targetSheet As Worksheet
    
    ' Set the target worksheet
    Set targetSheet = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet2")
    
    ' Set the connection string and command text
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections.Add2("MyPowerQuery", "My Power Query Connection")
    conn.OLEDBConnection.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM [MyPowerQuery]"
    
    ' Load the query results to the target worksheet
    With targetSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=xlSrcExternal, Source:=conn, Destination:=targetSheet.Range("A1")).QueryTable
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With
    
    ' Delete the connection
    conn.Delete
End Sub
```

Replace "MyPowerQuery" with the name of your Power Query.
