@Configuration should be used when you want to define beans using Java-based configuration instead of XML configuration. It is typically used to define beans that require complex initialization or wiring, or when you need to define beans that are not part of your application's core functionality. @Service, @Controller, and @Component are used to annotate classes that provide specific functionality within your application.
