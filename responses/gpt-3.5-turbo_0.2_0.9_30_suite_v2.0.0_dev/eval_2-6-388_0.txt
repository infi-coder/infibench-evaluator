The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you will not have access to this attribute.

To use `[Keyless]`, you need to make sure you are using Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later. You can check the version of Entity Framework Core you are using by looking at the version number of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package in your project's dependencies.

If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you will need to add a primary key to your keyless entity. You can do this by using the `[Key]` attribute on one or more properties of the entity, or by overriding the `OnModelCreating` method in your `DbContext` and using the `HasKey` method to specify a primary key for the entity.
