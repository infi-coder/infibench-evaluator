For the first question regarding the CSRF token mismatch error, it seems like the issue could be related to the session configuration on the host domain. One possible cause could be that the session storage path is not writable by the web server user. You can try changing the session storage path to a writable directory or check the file permissions of the current storage path. Another possible cause could be that the session cookie domain is not set correctly. You can try setting the session cookie domain to the domain of your application in the session configuration file.

For the second question regarding the SMTP error, it seems like the issue could be related to the SSL encryption. The error message indicates that the SSL version number is incorrect. You can try changing the encryption type to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' in the .env file and the mail.php configuration file. Additionally, you can try changing the port number to 465 instead of 587, as some SMTP servers use this port for SSL encryption. If these solutions do not work, you can try contacting the email provider for further assistance.
