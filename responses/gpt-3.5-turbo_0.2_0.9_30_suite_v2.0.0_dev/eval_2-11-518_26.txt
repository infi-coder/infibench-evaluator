The Rule of 5 is not outdated and is still relevant today. While it is true that implicit constructors and destructors work fine for aggregate data structures, there are cases where user-defined constructors and destructors are necessary.

For example, if a class manages a resource that cannot be handled by a smart pointer, such as a file handle or a network socket, then a user-defined destructor is necessary to properly release that resource. Similarly, if a class has non-copyable or non-movable members, then user-defined copy and move constructors and assignment operators are necessary to properly handle those members.

While it is true that many resource managing classes can be converted into an aggregate data structure using a smart pointer, this is not always the best solution. Smart pointers have overhead and can introduce additional complexity, and in some cases, it may be more efficient or simpler to manage the resource directly in the class.

In summary, while the Rule of 5 may not be necessary for all classes, it is still an important guideline to follow for classes that manage resources or have non-copyable or non-movable members.
