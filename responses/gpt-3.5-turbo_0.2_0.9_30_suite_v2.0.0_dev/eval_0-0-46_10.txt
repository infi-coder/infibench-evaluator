The error you are seeing is related to ESLint, which is a tool used to analyze and enforce coding standards in your codebase. It seems that ESLint is trying to read your `tsconfig.json` file but is unable to find it. 

To fix this issue, you need to make sure that the `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project. If it is already there, try specifying the path to the `tsconfig.json` file in your `.eslintrc.js` file. 

To do this, update the `parserOptions` object in your `.eslintrc.js` file to include the `tsconfigRootDir` property, like this:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./tsconfig.json",
  tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This tells ESLint where to find the `tsconfig.json` file. The `__dirname` variable is a Node.js global variable that represents the directory of the current module, which in this case is the `.eslintrc.js` file.

After making this change, restart VSCode and see if the error goes away. If it doesn't, try running `npm install` to make sure all dependencies are up to date.
