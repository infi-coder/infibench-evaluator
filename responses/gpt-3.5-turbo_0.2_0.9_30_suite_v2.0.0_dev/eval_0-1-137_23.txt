The issue is that you are missing a comma after the value of the "primary" color in your `$theme-colors` map. Here's the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here,
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace `#your-color-here` with the actual color value you want to use. After making this change, you should be able to compile your SCSS file without any errors.
