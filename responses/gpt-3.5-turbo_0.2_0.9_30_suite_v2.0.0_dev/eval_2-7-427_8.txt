For the first question, the issue could be related to the session configuration on the host domain. You can try checking the session configuration on the host domain and ensure that it is set up correctly. Also, make sure that the session driver is set to the same value on both the local and host environments.

For the second question, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used is incorrect. You can try changing the encryption method to `tls` instead of `ssl` in your `.env` file and see if that resolves the issue. Additionally, you can try changing the port to `465` instead of `587` and see if that works. If the issue persists, you may need to contact the email provider for further assistance.
