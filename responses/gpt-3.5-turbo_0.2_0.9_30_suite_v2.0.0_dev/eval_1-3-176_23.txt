The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib first and then install Pillow again. 

On Windows, you can install zlib using the following steps:

1. Download the pre-built zlib library from the official website: https://www.zlib.net/
2. Extract the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.
3. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted the zlib files.
4. Run the following command to build and install zlib:

```
nmake -f win32/Makefile.msc
nmake -f win32/Makefile.msc install
```

After installing zlib, try installing Pillow again using `pip install pillow`.
