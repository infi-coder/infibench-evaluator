Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the following command:

```
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you to enter your current passphrase for the key, and then it will ask you to enter a new passphrase (you can leave it blank if you don't want to set a new passphrase). After that, the key will be converted to the RSA format and saved in the same file (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

As for your second question, you don't need to transfer your `id_rsa.pub` file because it is just the public key that corresponds to your private key. The server administrator already has this file, and they only need your private key to grant you access to the server.
