Yes, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to retrieve the description of a Windows Service. Here's an example:

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description | Out-GridView
```

This will display a grid view with the name, display name, and description of all Windows Services. You can also filter the results by name or display name using the `Where-Object` cmdlet. For example:

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "wuauserv"} | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description
```

This will display the name, display name, and description of the "Windows Update" service.
