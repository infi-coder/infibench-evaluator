The `f` in `print(f"...")` stands for f-strings, which is a feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allows you to embed expressions inside string literals. 

In the example you provided, the `f` before the string literal allows you to embed the values of `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` into the string. The expressions inside the curly braces `{}` are evaluated at runtime and their values are inserted into the string.

For example, if `args.input_directory` is `"/path/to/input"` and `args.output_directory` is `"/path/to/output"`, the output of the `print` statements would be:

```
Input directory: /path/to/input
Output directory: /path/to/output
```

Using f-strings can make your code more concise and easier to read, especially when you need to include variables or expressions in your string literals.
