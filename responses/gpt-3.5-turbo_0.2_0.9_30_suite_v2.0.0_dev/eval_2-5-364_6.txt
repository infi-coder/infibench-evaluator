You can specify the path to the Java executable that you want to use by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. Here's how you can do it:

1. Find the path to the Java executable that works with the Maven task. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   mvn -version
   ```

   Look for the `Java home` line in the output. It should look something like this:

   ```
   Java home: /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre
   ```

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path you found in step 1. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre
   ```

   Replace the path with the one you found in step 1.

3. Run the Maven wrapper command again. It should now use the Java executable that you specified in the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

   ```
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

   Note that you need to use `./mvnw` instead of `mvn` to run the Maven wrapper.
