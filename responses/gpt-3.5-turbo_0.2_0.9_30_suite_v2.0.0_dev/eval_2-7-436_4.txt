The error message suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, and Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9. 

Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your current PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -v
```

If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you need to upgrade it to install Laravel 9.

Additionally, make sure that you have the required PHP extensions installed. Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions:

- BCMath
- Ctype
- Fileinfo
- JSON
- Mbstring
- OpenSSL
- PDO
- Tokenizer
- XML
- cURL

You can check if these extensions are installed by running the following command:

```bash
php -m
```

If any of these extensions are missing, you need to install them.

Finally, make sure that you have the latest version of Composer installed. You can update Composer by running the following command:

```bash
composer self-update
```

After upgrading PHP, installing the required extensions, and updating Composer, try running the `composer create-project` command again to install Laravel 9.
