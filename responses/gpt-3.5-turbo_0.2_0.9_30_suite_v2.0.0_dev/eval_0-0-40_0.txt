The error message indicates that there is an issue with the interpreter for the `npm` command. This could be due to a line ending issue in the npm script file. 

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the npm script file using the command `sudo nano /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm`
2. Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `O` to enable the conversion of line endings to Unix format.
3. Press `Ctrl` + `X` to save and exit the file.
4. Try running the `npm -v` command again.

If the above steps do not work, you can try reinstalling `npm` using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

This should install the latest version of `npm` and fix any issues with the script file.
