The `FormatException` is thrown when the JSON string is not properly formatted. In your case, the error message suggests that the first character of the JSON string is unexpected.

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the response body to ensure that it is a valid JSON string. You can print the response body to the console to see the actual JSON string returned by the PHP file.

2. If the response body is not a valid JSON string, you need to fix the PHP file to return a valid JSON string. You can use a JSON validator to check the validity of the JSON string.

3. If the response body is a valid JSON string, you can try to decode it using the `try-catch` block to handle the `FormatException`:

```dart
try {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} catch (e) {
  print('Error decoding JSON: $e');
}
```

This will catch the `FormatException` and print the error message to the console. You can then investigate the error message to determine the cause of the issue.
