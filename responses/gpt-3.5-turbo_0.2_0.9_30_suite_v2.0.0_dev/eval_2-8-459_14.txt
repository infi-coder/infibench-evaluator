It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is present in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
```
If the module is not present in the cache, it means that it is not being downloaded. In this case, you can try the next step.

2. Check if there are any network issues preventing the module from being downloaded. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
go env -w GOPRIVATE=github.ibm.com
```
This will tell Go to treat all modules under `github.ibm.com` as private and use the credentials you have set up for that domain. Then, try running `go build` again and see if the module is downloaded.

3. Check if the module is available on the remote repository. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
go list -m -versions github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
```
This will list all available versions of the module. If the version you are trying to use (`v0.1.5`) is not listed, it means that it does not exist on the remote repository. In this case, you can try using a different version or contacting the module owner to see if they can provide more information.

4. Check if there are any issues with the module's `go.mod` file. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
go mod verify
```
This will verify that all modules in the dependency graph are consistent with the contents of their `go.mod` files. If there are any inconsistencies, it will report them.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you debug the issue and get the module downloaded on computer B.
