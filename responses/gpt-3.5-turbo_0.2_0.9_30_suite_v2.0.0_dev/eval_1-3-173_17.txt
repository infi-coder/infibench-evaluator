Yes, you can use the `date_range` function in Pandas to create a range of dates for the given year and then calculate the length of the range to get the total number of days in the year. Here is the implementation of the `DaysInYear` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def DaysInYear(year):
    start_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-01-01')
    end_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-12-31')
    days_in_year = len(pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date))
    return days_in_year
```

This function takes the year as an argument and converts it into a start date and an end date using the `to_datetime` function. Then it creates a range of dates using `date_range` and calculates the length of the range to get the total number of days in the year.
