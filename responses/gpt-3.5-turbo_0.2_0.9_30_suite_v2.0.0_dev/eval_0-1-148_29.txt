Yes, you can use the `first` and `last` pseudo-class variants of Tailwind to achieve this. Here's the revised code:

```html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="(item, index) in items"
    :key="`item-${index}`"
    class="border-solid border-b border-black {{ index === items.length - 1 ? '' : 'pb-2' }}"
  >
    Item
  </li>
</ul>
```

In the `class` attribute of the `li` element, we added `pb-2` (padding-bottom of 0.5rem) to all items except the last one. We used a ternary operator to conditionally apply this class based on whether the current item is the last one or not.

Note that we also removed the `border-b` class from the `li` element and added it to the `ul` element instead. This is because we don't want a border-bottom on the last item, so we need to apply it to the `ul` element instead. Here's the CSS for the `ul` element:

```css
ul > *:not(:last-child) {
  border-bottom-width: 1px;
}
```

This CSS selector targets all direct children of the `ul` element that are not the last child, and applies a border-bottom with a width of 1px to them.
