You can disable the animation in ViewPager2 by setting the `offscreenPageLimit` to 0. This will prevent the ViewPager2 from preloading any pages and will show the new fragment immediately when the tab is clicked. Here's an example:

```kotlin
viewPager2.offscreenPageLimit = 0
```

You can also disable the swipe animation by setting the `isUserInputEnabled` property to false:

```kotlin
viewPager2.isUserInputEnabled = false
```

However, this will also disable the ability to swipe between pages, so it may not be what you want.
