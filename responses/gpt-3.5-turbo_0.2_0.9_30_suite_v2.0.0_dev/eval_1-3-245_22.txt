It seems that the Dockerfile is not able to find the `app` module. You can try changing the `COPY` command in the Dockerfile to:

```
COPY ./fastapi/app /app
```

This will copy the `app` module from the `fastapi` directory to the `/app` directory in the Docker container.

Also, make sure that the `requirements.txt` file is in the same directory as the Dockerfile and has the necessary dependencies for the `app` module.

After making these changes, rebuild the Docker image using:

```
docker-compose build
```

And then run the container using:

```
docker-compose up -d
```
