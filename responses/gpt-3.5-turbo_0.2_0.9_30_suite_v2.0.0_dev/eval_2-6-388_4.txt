The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you will not have access to this attribute.

To use `[Keyless]`, you need to make sure that you have installed Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later. You can check the version of Entity Framework Core that you are using by looking at the version number of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package in your project's dependencies.

If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you can still create keyless entities by defining a class that does not have a primary key property, and then using the `EntityTypeBuilder.HasNoKey` method to configure the entity type as keyless in your `DbContext` class. Here's an example:

```c#
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string Property1 { get; set; }
    public int Property2 { get; set; }
}

public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<MyKeylessClass>().HasNoKey();
    }
}
```

With this configuration, you can use `FromSqlRaw` to query the keyless entity without having to define a primary key.
