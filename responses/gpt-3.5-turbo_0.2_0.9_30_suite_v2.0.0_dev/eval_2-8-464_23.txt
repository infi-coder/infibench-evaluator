The error message `fork/exec /var/task/main: no such file or directory` indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the expected location `/var/task/`. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The executable file was not properly included in the ZIP file that was uploaded to AWS Lambda.
2. The executable file was not built for the correct platform (Linux) and architecture (x86_64) that AWS Lambda uses.
3. The handler name specified in the AWS Lambda function configuration does not match the name of the executable file.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Ensure that you have built the executable file for the correct platform and architecture. You can do this by building the executable file on a Linux machine or by using a tool like `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build main.go` to build the executable file for Linux and x86_64 architecture.
2. Ensure that the executable file is included in the ZIP file that is uploaded to AWS Lambda. You can do this by creating a new ZIP file that includes the executable file and any other necessary files, and then uploading the new ZIP file to AWS Lambda.
3. Ensure that the handler name specified in the AWS Lambda function configuration matches the name of the executable file. In this case, the handler name should be `main`.

After making these changes, you can test the Lambda function again to see if the issue has been resolved.
