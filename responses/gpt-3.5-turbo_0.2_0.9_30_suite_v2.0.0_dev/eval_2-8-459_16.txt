It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is present in the module cache on computer B. You can find the module cache location by running `go env GOMODCACHE`. If the module is not present, try running `go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5` to download it.

2. Check if the module is accessible from computer B. Try running `go list -m -versions github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` to see if the module and its versions are listed. If not, it could be a network issue or a problem with the module's accessibility.

3. Check if the module's version is correct. It's possible that the version specified in the `go.mod` file is incorrect or outdated. Try running `go list -m all` to see the versions of all modules in the project.

4. Check if the module's source code has been updated. If the module has been updated on computer A but not on computer B, it could cause version conflicts. Try running `go mod download` to update all modules in the project.

5. Check if there are any conflicting modules. It's possible that another module in the project is conflicting with `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client`. Try running `go mod why -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` to see if there are any conflicts.

I hope these steps help you debug the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions!
