It seems that the issue is related to the network configuration of your app. The `uri` you are using in your `ApolloClient` configuration is not accessible from your React Native app. 

You can try using a different `uri` that is accessible from your app. You can use a local GraphQL server or a public GraphQL API that is accessible from your app.

For example, you can use the following `uri` to fetch data from the SpaceX GraphQL API:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://api.spacex.land/graphql/',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

Also, make sure that your device or emulator is connected to the internet and that there are no network restrictions or firewalls that prevent your app from accessing the `uri`.

If the issue persists, you can try enabling network debugging in your app to see if there are any network errors or issues. You can use the `react-native-debugger` tool or the `Flipper` tool to debug network requests and responses in your app.
