The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is likely because the file was not properly included in the ZIP file that was uploaded to AWS Lambda.

Here are some steps you can follow to ensure that the executable file is included in the ZIP file:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where your `main.exe` file is located.
2. Create a new directory named `bin` in the same directory as `main.exe`.
3. Move `main.exe` into the `bin` directory.
4. Create a new ZIP file that includes the `bin` directory and its contents. You can do this by right-clicking on the `bin` directory and selecting "Send to" -> "Compressed (zipped) folder" (on Windows) or by running the following command in a terminal window:

   ```
   zip -r main.zip bin/
   ```

5. Upload the `main.zip` file to AWS Lambda and test the function again.

Your updated code should look like this:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
)

// Request represents the requested object
type Request struct {
    ID    int    `json:"ID"`
    Value string `json:"Value"`
}

// Response represents the Response object
type Response struct {
    Message string `json:"Message"`
    Ok      bool   `json:"Ok"`
}

// Handler represents the Handler of lambda
func Handler(request Request) (Response, error) {
    return Response{
        Message: fmt.Sprint("Process Request Id %f", request.ID),
        Ok:      true,
    }, nil
}

func main() {
    lambda.Start(Handler)
}
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
