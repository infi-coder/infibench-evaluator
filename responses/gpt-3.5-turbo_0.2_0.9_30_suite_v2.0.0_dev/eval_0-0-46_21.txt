The error message you are seeing is related to ESLint, which is a popular tool used for linting JavaScript and TypeScript code. It seems that ESLint is unable to find your `tsconfig.json` file, which is needed to properly parse your TypeScript code.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project. If it is not, you will need to update the `parserOptions.project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the correct location of your `tsconfig.json` file.

2. If your `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project, you can try updating the `parserOptions.project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the correct location of your `tsconfig.json` file. For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is located in the `src` directory, you can update the property to `"parserOptions.project": "./src/tsconfig.json"`.

3. If the above steps do not work, you can try running the following command in your terminal to clear the ESLint cache: `npx eslint --clear-cache`.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try reinstalling ESLint by running the following command in your terminal: `npm uninstall eslint && npm install eslint`.

After trying these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and see the red lines disappear in your `.ts` files.
