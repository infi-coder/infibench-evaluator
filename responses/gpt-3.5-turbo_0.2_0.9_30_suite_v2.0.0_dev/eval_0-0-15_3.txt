To mock the `API` class properly, you need to return a constructor function that returns an object with the mocked methods. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {
      someMethod: jest.fn()
    };
  });
});

// Now you can create a new instance of the mocked API class
const api = new API();
```

This code creates a mock implementation of the `API` class constructor that returns an object with the `someMethod` method. The `jest.fn()` function is used to create a mock function for `someMethod` so that you can spy on it in your tests.
