The Rule of 5 is not outdated, as there are still cases where you may need to define these special member functions. 

For example, if your class manages a resource that cannot be handled by a smart pointer (such as a file handle or a network socket), you will need to define a destructor to properly release the resource. 

Similarly, if your class has non-copyable or non-movable members, you will need to define the corresponding copy or move constructors/assignment operators to properly handle those members.

While it is true that smart pointers can often be used to manage resources, they are not always the best solution. In some cases, you may want more fine-grained control over the lifetime of the resource, or you may need to use a custom allocator. In these cases, defining your own constructors and destructors may be necessary.

In summary, while the Rule of 5 may not apply to all classes, it is still an important guideline to follow when designing classes that manage resources or have non-copyable/non-movable members.
