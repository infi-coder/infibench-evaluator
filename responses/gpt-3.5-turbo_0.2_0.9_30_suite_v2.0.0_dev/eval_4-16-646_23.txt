This error message usually appears when you are trying to run a binary that was compiled for a different CPU architecture than the one you are currently using. In this case, it seems that the pdftk binary you are trying to run was compiled for a 32-bit architecture, which is no longer supported on the latest versions of macOS.

One solution is to install a 64-bit version of pdftk. You can do this by using the Homebrew package manager. Here are the steps:

1. Install Homebrew by running the following command in your terminal:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to install pdftk:

```
brew install pdftk-java
```

This will install a Java-based version of pdftk that is compatible with macOS Catalina.

3. After installation, you can run pdftk by typing the following command in your terminal:

```
pdftk
```

This should launch pdftk and you should be able to use it without any issues.

I hope this helps!
