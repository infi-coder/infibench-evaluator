The warning message is indicating that Elasticsearch built-in security features are not enabled, which means that your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone without authentication. To fix this, you need to enable security features in Elasticsearch.

Here are the steps to enable security features in Elasticsearch:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` in your Rails app.

2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:

```
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning message should disappear. If you still see the warning message, you may need to check if there are any other Elasticsearch configuration files that need to be updated.

Note: If you are using Elasticsearch version 7.11 or later, you will need to install the Elasticsearch security plugin separately. You can do this by running the following command:

```
bin/elasticsearch-plugin install -b https://d3g5vo6xdbdb9a.cloudfront.net/downloads/elasticsearch-plugins/security/security-7.13.1.zip
```

Replace `7.13.1` with your Elasticsearch version.
