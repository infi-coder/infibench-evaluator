Yes, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to retrieve the detailed description of a Windows service. Here's an example:

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description | Out-GridView
```

This will display a grid view of all Windows services, including their name, display name, and description. You can also filter the results by specifying the name of a specific service:

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service -Filter "Name='wuauserv'" | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description
```

This will display the name, display name, and description of the "Windows Update" service.
