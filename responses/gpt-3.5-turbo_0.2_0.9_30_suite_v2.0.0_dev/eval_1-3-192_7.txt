Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r'[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

Here, we first check if the input string is empty or not. If it's empty, we return an empty string. Otherwise, we split the string into words using the regular expression `[-_]` which matches either a dash or an underscore. Then, we capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one, and join them together to form the camel case string.
