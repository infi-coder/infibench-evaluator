To mock the `API` class, you need to return a constructor function that creates an object with the mocked methods. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {
      someMethod: jest.fn()
    };
  });
});

const api = new API();
```

This code creates a mock implementation of the `API` class by returning a constructor function that creates an object with the mocked `someMethod` method. The `jest.fn()` function is used to create a mock function for the `someMethod` method. 

When you call `new API()`, Jest will use the mocked constructor function to create a new instance of the `API` class with the mocked methods.
