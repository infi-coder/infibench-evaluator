The error message suggests that the version of PHP you are using is not compatible with Laravel 9. Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. 

You can check your current PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -v
```

If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you will need to upgrade your PHP version first. You can do this by following the instructions for your operating system.

Once you have upgraded your PHP version, try running the `composer create-project` command again. It should now be able to find and install the Laravel 9 package.
