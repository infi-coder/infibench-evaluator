The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file for your Go code. This is because the executable file generated by the `go build` command is specific to the operating system and architecture on which it was built. In your case, you built the executable on a Windows platform, but Lambda runs on a Linux platform.

To fix this issue, you need to build your Go code for the Linux platform. You can do this by cross-compiling your code on a Linux machine or by using a Docker container to build your code for the Linux platform.

Here's how you can use Docker to build your code for the Linux platform:

1. Install Docker on your Windows machine if you haven't already done so.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to your project directory.
3. Run the following command to pull the official Go Docker image:

   ```
   docker pull golang
   ```

4. Run the following command to start a Docker container and mount your project directory as a volume:

   ```
   docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/go/src/app -w /go/src/app golang:latest go build -o main main.go
   ```

   This command will build your Go code for the Linux platform and generate an executable file named `main`.

5. Zip the `main` executable file and upload it to your Lambda function.

   ```
   zip main.zip main
   ```

6. Update the handler name in your Lambda function to `main`.

   ```
   main
   ```

7. Test your Lambda function again using the test event.

   Your Lambda function should now be able to find the `main` executable file and execute your Go code.
