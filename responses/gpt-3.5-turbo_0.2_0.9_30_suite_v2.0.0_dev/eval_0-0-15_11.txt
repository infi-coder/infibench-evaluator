To mock a class with Jest, you need to return a constructor function that creates an instance of the class. Here's the revised code that should eliminate the error:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  // Returns a constructor function
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {
      someMethod: () => {}
    };
  });
});

const api = new API();
```

This code creates a mock implementation of the `API` class that returns an object with a `someMethod` function. The mock implementation is returned by a constructor function that is created by `jest.fn()`. When you call `new API()`, Jest will use this constructor function to create an instance of the mock implementation.
