The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is because the executable file is compiled for the Windows platform and is not compatible with the Linux environment in which AWS Lambda runs.

To fix this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code for the Linux environment. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables before building your code.

Here are the steps to cross-compile your Go code for AWS Lambda:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Go code is located.

2. Set the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to `linux` and `amd64` respectively. This will ensure that your code is compiled for the Linux environment.

   ```
   set GOOS=linux
   set GOARCH=amd64
   ```

3. Build your code using the `go build` command.

   ```
   go build main.go
   ```

4. Zip the executable file and any other required files into a single archive.

   ```
   zip main.zip main
   ```

5. Upload the `main.zip` file to your AWS Lambda function.

6. Test your Lambda function to ensure that it is working as expected.

   If you still face any issues, you can check the CloudWatch logs for your Lambda function to get more information about the error.
