It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is present in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is present in the cache, you should see output similar to the following:

   ```
   github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is not present in the cache, you will see an error message.

2. Check if the module is accessible from computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m -versions github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
   ```

   This will list all the available versions of the module. If the module is not accessible, you will see an error message.

3. Check if there are any network issues preventing the module from being downloaded. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go env GONOPROXY GONOSUMDB GOPRIVATE
   ```

   This will show you the values of the environment variables that control module fetching. Make sure that the module is not excluded by any of these variables.

4. Try to download the module manually using `go get`. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   This will download the module and its dependencies to the module cache. If there are any issues with the network or authentication, you will see an error message.

Once you have identified the issue, you can take steps to resolve it. For example, if the module is not accessible, you may need to check your access permissions. If there are network issues, you may need to configure your proxy settings or check your network connection.
