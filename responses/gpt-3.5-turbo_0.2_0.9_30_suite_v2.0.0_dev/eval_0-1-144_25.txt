You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after` pseudo-element and setting its `border-color` property to green. Here's an example CSS code:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    border-color: green;
}
```

You can add this code to your CSS file or add it inside a `<style>` tag in your HTML file. Make sure to include this code after the Bootstrap CSS file to override the default styles.
