You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate a Power Query. Here's an example code:

```
Sub RefreshPowerQuery()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Dim oledbConn As OLEDBConnection
    
    ' Get the connection for the Power Query
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections("Query - SalesData")
    
    ' Cast the connection to an OLEDBConnection
    Set oledbConn = conn.OLEDBConnection
    
    ' Refresh the connection
    oledbConn.BackgroundQuery = False
    conn.Refresh
End Sub
```

Replace "Query - SalesData" with the name of your Power Query connection.
