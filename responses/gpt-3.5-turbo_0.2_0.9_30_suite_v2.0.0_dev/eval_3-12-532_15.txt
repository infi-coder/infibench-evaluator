The `FormatException` error occurs when the JSON string is not properly formatted. In your case, the error is most likely caused by an invalid JSON response from the PHP file.

To solve this error, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the response from the PHP file by printing it to the console before decoding it. This will help you identify any syntax errors or unexpected characters in the response.

```dart
print(response.body);
```

2. If the response is not valid JSON, you can modify the PHP file to return a valid JSON response. You can use a JSON validator to check the validity of the response.

3. If the response is valid JSON, you can try using a try-catch block to handle the `FormatException` error and provide a fallback response.

```dart
try {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
  // handle the decoded data
} catch (e) {
  print('Error decoding JSON: $e');
  // provide a fallback response
}
```

By following these steps, you should be able to solve the `FormatException` error and properly decode the JSON response from the PHP file.
