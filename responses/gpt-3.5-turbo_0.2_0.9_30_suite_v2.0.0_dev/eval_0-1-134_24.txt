It sounds like you might be trying to use a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less. These preprocessors allow you to write CSS in a more efficient way by using variables, nesting, and other features. 

In Sass, for example, you can use the `&` symbol to reference the parent selector. So if you have a class called `.button` and you want to add a hover effect, you can write:

```
.button {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  
  &:hover {
    background-color: red;
  }
}
```

This will compile to:

```
.button {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: red;
}
```

If you're not using a preprocessor and you're just trying to use regular CSS, make sure you're using the correct syntax. To target a class, you should use a period before the class name, like this:

```
.my-class {
  /* styles go here */
}
```
