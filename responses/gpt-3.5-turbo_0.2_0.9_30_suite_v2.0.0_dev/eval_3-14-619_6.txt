The issue is that `ContentView_Previews` is using `@State` instead of `@Binding` for `selected`. Change `@State` to `@Binding` and pass in a `Bool` value to `ContentView_Previews` to fix the issue. 

```
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: .constant(false))
    }
}
```
