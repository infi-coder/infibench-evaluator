You can use list slicing to replace the first 4 elements of `b` with the elements in `rest`. Then, you can loop through `last` and replace any element that matches with an element in the modified `b` list with the corresponding element from `rest`.

Here's the implementation of the `ReplaceElementsByIndex` function:

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    b[:4] = rest
    for i in range(len(last)):
        if last[i] in b:
            last[i] = rest[b.index(last[i])]
    return last
```

Here's how you can use the function:

```python
rest = [5, 7, 11, 4]
b = [21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last = [33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

result = ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last)
print(result)  # Output: [11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

In the above example, the first 4 elements of `b` are replaced with the elements in `rest` using list slicing. Then, the `last` list is looped through and any element that matches with an element in the modified `b` list is replaced with the corresponding element from `rest`. The resulting list is returned as the output.
