Yes, you can use the `first` and `last` pseudo-class variants in Tailwind to achieve this. Here's the revised code:

```html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="(item, index) in items"
    :key="`item-${index}`"
    class="border-solid border-b border-black {{ index === items.length - 1 ? '' : 'pb-4' }}"
  >
    Item
  </li>
</ul>
```

In the `class` attribute of the `<li>` element, we added the `pb-4` class only for all the `<li>` elements except the last one. This class adds a `padding-bottom` of `1rem` to the element, which creates the illusion of a border-bottom.

We used a ternary operator to conditionally add this class. If the current index is equal to the last index of the `items` array, we don't add the `pb-4` class. Otherwise, we add it.

Note that we also removed the `border-b` class from the `<li>` element's `class` attribute since we're using `pb-4` to create the border-bottom effect.
