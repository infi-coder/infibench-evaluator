If you want to use the same version of Java that works with the Maven task, you can specify the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the location of the JDK that Maven is using. 

To do this, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk
```

Replace `/path/to/jdk` with the actual path to the JDK that Maven is using. 

Alternatively, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in your operating system's settings so that it is always available. 

Once you have set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, you should be able to run the Maven wrapper using the same version of Java that Maven is using.
