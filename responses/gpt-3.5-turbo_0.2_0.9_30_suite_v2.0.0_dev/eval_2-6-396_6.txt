The error message is caused by the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` in your `OnModelCreating` method. You cannot create an index on a navigation property, which is what `Gender` is in the `User` entity.

To fix this issue, you can remove the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` from your `OnModelCreating` method. This will remove the attempt to create an index on the `Gender` navigation property.

Your updated `OnModelCreating` method should look like this:
```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);
    }
}
```

After making this change, you should be able to run `dotnet ef add migration User` without any errors.
