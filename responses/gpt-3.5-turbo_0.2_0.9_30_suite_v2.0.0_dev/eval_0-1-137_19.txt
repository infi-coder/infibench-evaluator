The error is occurring because you are missing a comma after the color value for the "primary" key in the `$theme-colors` map. Here's the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here,
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace `#your-color-here` with the actual color value you want to use for the primary color.

Also, make sure that you are compiling the SCSS file to CSS using the correct command. If you are using the `sass` command, the correct syntax is:

```
sass input.scss output.css
```

So in your case, it would be:

```
sass style.scss custom.css
```

This will compile `style.scss` to `custom.css`.
