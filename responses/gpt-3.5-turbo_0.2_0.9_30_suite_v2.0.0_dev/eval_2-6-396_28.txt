The error message is caused by the `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` line in your `OnModelCreating` method. You cannot create an index on a navigation property (`Gender` in this case), only on scalar properties.

To fix the error, remove the `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` line from your `OnModelCreating` method. This will allow you to create the migration successfully.

If you need to create an index on a scalar property, you can do so by adding the following code to your `OnModelCreating` method:

```c#
user.HasIndex(x => x.PropertyName);
```

Replace `PropertyName` with the name of the scalar property you want to create an index on.
