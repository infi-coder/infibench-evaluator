You can use the `tidyr` package in R to split the comma and colon separated column into respective columns. Here's the function `mySplit` that does this:

```r
library(tidyr)

mySplit <- function(df) {
  df_split <- separate(df, col1, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = ",|:")
  df_split <- df_split[, c(2, 3, 4)]
  return(df_split)
}
```

In this function, we first use the `separate` function from `tidyr` to split the `col1` column into three separate columns based on the comma and colon separators. The `into` argument specifies the names of the new columns, and the `sep` argument specifies the separator to use for splitting.

After splitting, we reorder the columns to match the desired output using the `[, c(2, 3, 4)]` syntax.

Finally, we return the resulting data frame `df_split`.

You can call this function by passing your data frame `df` as an argument, like this:

```r
df <- data.frame(col1 = c("name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC", "name:Tom,Age:25,City:NA"))
mySplit(df)
```

This should return the desired output:

```
      name Age City
1 Michael  31  NYC
2     Tom  25   NA
```
