It seems that the Dockerfile is unable to find the `app` module. You can try the following steps to revise your Dockerfile:

1. Make sure that the `app` directory is in the same directory as the Dockerfile.

2. Update the `COPY` command in the Dockerfile to copy the `app` directory to the `/app` directory in the container:

   ```
   COPY app /app
   ```

3. Build the Docker image using the following command:

   ```
   docker build -t myimage .
   ```

4. Update your docker-compose.yml file to use the image you just built:

   ```
   version: '3'
   services:
     myservice:
       image: myimage
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
   ```

5. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the container.

This should resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` issue.
