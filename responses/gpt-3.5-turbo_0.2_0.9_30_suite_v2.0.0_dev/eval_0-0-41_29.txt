The code you provided looks correct. However, if the user denies the location permission, the `getCurrentPosition()` method will not execute the success callback function and will instead execute the error callback function. Therefore, you need to add an error callback function to handle the case where the user denies the location permission. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In the above code, the `getCurrentPosition()` method takes two callback functions as arguments. The first one is executed if the location is accessed successfully, and the second one is executed if there is an error (e.g. the user denies the location permission).
