You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate Power Query. Here's some sample code to get you started:

```
Sub RefreshPowerQuery()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Dim oledbConn As OLEDBConnection
    
    ' Get the connection for the Power Query
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections("Query - MyQueryName")
    
    ' Cast the connection to an OLEDBConnection
    Set oledbConn = conn.OLEDBConnection
    
    ' Refresh the connection
    oledbConn.BackgroundQuery = False
    conn.Refresh
End Sub
```

Replace "Query - MyQueryName" with the name of your Power Query connection. You can find the name of the connection in the Power Query Editor by clicking on the "Queries & Connections" pane on the right side of the screen.
