You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and keep them in the order that they appear in your source code. 

If you don't have a `.clang-format` file yet, you can create one in the root directory of your project and add the above line to it. 

Note that disabling the sorting of includes may lead to some issues with third-party libraries that require a specific include order. It's recommended to keep the include order consistent and follow the guidelines of the libraries you're using.
