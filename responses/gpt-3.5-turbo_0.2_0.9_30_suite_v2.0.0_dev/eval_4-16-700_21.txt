You can try using awk to achieve the same result more efficiently. Here's an example command:

```
awk -F= '/name/{name=$2} /value/{if(name){print name "=" $2; name=""}}' input.txt > output.txt
```

This command sets the field separator to "=" and then checks for lines starting with "name" and "value". If the line starts with "name", it saves the name value. If the line starts with "value" and there is a saved name value, it prints the name and value separated by "=" to the output file. This should be much faster than the original solution.
