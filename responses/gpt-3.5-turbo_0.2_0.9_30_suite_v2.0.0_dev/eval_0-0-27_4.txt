It seems like you are trying to fetch data from a remote GraphQL server using Apollo Client in React Native, but the loading state hangs at `true` and fails to fetch data.

One possible reason for this issue could be that the GraphQL server you are trying to connect to is not accessible or not responding. You can try to use a different GraphQL server or check if the server you are using is up and running.

Another possible reason could be that there is a network issue or a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue. You can try to check if there are any network issues or try to enable CORS on the server-side.

You can also try to add some error handling to your code to get more information about the error. For example, you can add a `console.log` statement inside the `error` block to see the error message.

```javascript
if (error) {
    console.log(error);
    return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
}
```

Additionally, you can try to use the `fetchPolicy` option to control the caching behavior of the query. For example, you can set the `fetchPolicy` to `network-only` to always fetch data from the server and bypass the cache.

```javascript
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES, {
    fetchPolicy: 'network-only',
});
```

I hope this helps you to resolve the issue.
