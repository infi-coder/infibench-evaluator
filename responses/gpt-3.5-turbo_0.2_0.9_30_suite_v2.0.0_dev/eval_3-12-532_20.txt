The `FormatException` is thrown when the JSON string is not properly formatted. In your case, it seems that the response body is not a valid JSON string. 

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Print the response body to see what it contains. You can use `print(response.body)` to do this.

2. Check if the response body is a valid JSON string. You can use an online JSON validator like https://jsonlint.com/ to validate the response body.

3. If the response body is not a valid JSON string, then you need to check your PHP code to ensure that it is returning a valid JSON response.

4. If the response body is a valid JSON string, then you can try to decode it using the `json.decode()` method. However, you need to make sure that the response body is not null before decoding it. You can use the `response.body.isNotEmpty` check to ensure that the response body is not empty before decoding it.

Here is an updated version of your code that includes these checks:

```dart
Future<String> iniciarSesion() async {
  var usuario = textUsuario.text;
  var password = textPassword.text;
  var nombreUsuario;
  var url = "http://192.168.1.37/usuario.php";

  //Metodo post
  var response = await http.post(
    url,
    headers: {"Accept": "application/json"},
    body: {"usuario": '$usuario', "password": '$password'},
    encoding: Encoding.getByName("utf-8"),
  );

  if (response.body.isNotEmpty) {
    print(response.body); // Print the response body for debugging purposes
    var data = json.decode(response.body);
    // Do something with the decoded data
  } else {
    // Handle the case where the response body is empty
  }
}
```
