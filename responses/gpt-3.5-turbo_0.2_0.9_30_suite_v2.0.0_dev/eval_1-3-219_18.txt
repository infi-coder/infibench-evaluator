Here are some steps you can try to solve the issue:

1. Check if the Jupyter package is installed in your virtual environment. You can do this by activating the environment and running the command `conda list`. Look for the package `jupyter` in the list of installed packages. If it's not installed, you can install it using the command `conda install jupyter`.

2. Check if the IPython kernel is installed in your virtual environment. You can do this by activating the environment and running the command `jupyter kernelspec list`. Look for the kernel for your environment (in this case, `da38`). If it's not listed, you can install it using the command `python -m ipykernel install --user --name da38 --display-name "Python 3.8.5 (da38)"`.

3. Check if the Jupyter extension is installed in VS Code. You can do this by opening the Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X) and searching for "Jupyter". If it's not installed, you can install it from there.

4. Check if the Jupyter server is running. You can do this by opening a terminal in VS Code and running the command `jupyter notebook`. If it's not running, you can start it using that command.

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try resetting the Jupyter configuration in VS Code. You can do this by opening the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and searching for "Jupyter: Reset Notebook Configuration". This will reset all Jupyter settings and configurations in VS Code.

Hopefully, one of these steps will solve your issue and allow you to use Jupyter in VS Code again.
