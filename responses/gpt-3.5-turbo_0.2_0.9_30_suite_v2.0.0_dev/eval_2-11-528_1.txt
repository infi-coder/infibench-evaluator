You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and preserve the order in which they appear in your code. 

If you want to disable the sorting of includes for a specific file, you can add the following comment at the top of the file:

```c++
// clang-format off
#include <header1.h>
#include <header2.h>
// clang-format on
```

This will disable clang-format for the includes in that file.
