Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r'[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

Here, we first check if the input string is empty or not. If it is empty, we return an empty string. Otherwise, we split the string into words using the regular expression `[-_]` which matches either a dash or an underscore. We then capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one and join them together to form the camel case string.

You will also need to import the `re` module at the beginning of your code to use regular expressions.
