Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r'[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

In this code, we first check if the input string is empty or not. If it is empty, we return an empty string. Otherwise, we split the input string into words using the regular expression `[-_]`. We then capitalize the first letter of each word except the first word, and join them together to form the camel case string.

You will also need to import the `re` module at the beginning of your code to use the `split` function with a regular expression.
