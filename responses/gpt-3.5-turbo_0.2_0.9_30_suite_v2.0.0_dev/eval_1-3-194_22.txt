To write a list of lists into an Excel file, we can use the `openpyxl` library in Python. Here's the implementation of the `writeToExcel` function:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeToExcel():
    # Create a new workbook
    workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()

    # Select the active worksheet
    worksheet = workbook.active

    # Define the data to be written
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

    # Write the data to the worksheet
    for row in new_list:
        worksheet.append(row)

    # Save the workbook
    workbook.save(filename="data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new workbook using the `openpyxl.Workbook()` method, selects the active worksheet, and writes the data to the worksheet using a `for` loop. Finally, it saves the workbook with the filename "data.xlsx".
