To trigger a client-side reload in Next.js, you can use the `router.reload()` method. Here's how you can use it in your code:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

export default function Component(){
    const router = useRouter();

    // Function to handle data creation
    const handleCreateData = async () => {
        // Code to create new data

        // Reload the page
        router.reload();
    }

    // Rest of the component code
}
```

In the above code, we import the `useRouter` hook from `next/router`. Then, we define a function `handleCreateData` which will be called when the new data is created. Inside this function, we create the new data and then call `router.reload()` to trigger a client-side reload.

Note that `router.reload()` will reload the entire page, including any data fetched using `getInitialProps`. So, when the page is reloaded, `getInitialProps` will be called again in the browser.
