Your `sed` command is not correctly removing the `?` and everything after it. Instead of using `.*`, which matches any character, use `[^?]*`, which matches any character except `?`. So your `sed` command should be:
```
sed 's/\([^?]*\)\?.*/\1/'
```
This will remove the `?` and everything after it. Also, the `mv` command is failing because the source and destination filenames are the same. You can fix this by using an absolute path for the destination filename. Here's the updated command:
```
find . -type f -name '*\?*' -exec sh -c 'mv "$1" "$(echo "$1" | sed "s/\([^?]*\)\?.*/\1/")"' _ {} \;
```
