Sure! The code you provided is almost correct, but you need to use the `|` operator instead of `,` to combine the two mapped types. Here's the corrected code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} | {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This defines a union type that can either have a numeric property for each fruit or a boolean property for each color.
