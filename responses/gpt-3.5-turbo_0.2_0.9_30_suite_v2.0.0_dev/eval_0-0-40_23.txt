The error message you are seeing indicates that there is an issue with the line endings in the `npm` executable. This is a common issue when using files created in Windows on a Unix-based system like Ubuntu.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the `npm` executable in a text editor that supports Unix-style line endings (e.g. Visual Studio Code).
2. Change the line endings from Windows-style (`\r\n`) to Unix-style (`\n`).
3. Save the file and try running `npm -v` again.

If this doesn't work, you can try reinstalling `npm` using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

This should install the latest version of `npm` and ensure that it has the correct line endings.
