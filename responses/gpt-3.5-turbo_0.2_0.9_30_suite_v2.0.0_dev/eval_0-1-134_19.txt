It sounds like you might be referring to Emmet, a plugin that allows you to write shorthand code and expand it into full HTML/CSS. 

To use Emmet, you can type out the shorthand code and then press the "Tab" key. For example, typing `.classname` and then pressing "Tab" should expand into `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, make sure that you have Emmet installed and enabled in your code editor. The specific steps for enabling Emmet may vary depending on your editor, so you may need to consult the documentation or do a quick Google search to find out how to enable it for your specific editor.
