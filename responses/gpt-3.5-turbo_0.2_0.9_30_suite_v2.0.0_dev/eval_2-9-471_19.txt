To import images in a React component with TypeScript and Parcel, you need to do the following:

1. Create a `.d.ts` file with the same name as your image file, e.g., `image.jpg.d.ts`. This file should contain the following code:

```typescript
declare module '*.jpg' {
  const value: any;
  export default value;
}
```

2. Place the `.d.ts` file in the same directory as the image file, e.g., `src/assets/image.jpg.d.ts`.

3. In your component file, import the image like this:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import image from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```

Note that you should use `import image from` instead of `import * as img from`.

4. Make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file includes the `.d.ts` file in the `include` array, like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*.ts",
    "src/**/*.tsx",
    "src/**/*.jpg.d.ts"
  ]
}
```

5. If you still get the error `Cannot find module`, try restarting your development server. TypeScript sometimes needs a restart to pick up new `.d.ts` files.

Also, make sure that you don't have an `index.d.ts` file in your `src` directory, as TypeScript is ignoring it because it assumes that it is generated from `index.tsx`, which is more likely to be up to date. Name your `.d.ts` file something else, e.g., `declaration.d.ts`.
