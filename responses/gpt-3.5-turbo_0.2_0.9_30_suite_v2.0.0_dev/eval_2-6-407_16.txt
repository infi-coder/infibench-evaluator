The error message suggests that the response from the server is not in the expected JSON format. It looks like the response starts with a '<' character, which is not valid JSON.

One possible reason for this error is that the server is returning an HTML error page instead of the expected JSON response. To confirm this, you can try accessing the API endpoint directly in the browser and see if it returns a valid JSON response.

If the server is returning an HTML error page, you need to fix the server-side code to return the expected JSON response. If the server is returning a valid JSON response, you may need to adjust the client-side code to handle the response correctly.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check the API endpoint URL: Make sure the URL is correct and matches the route defined in the controller.

2. Check the JSON format: Make sure the server is returning a valid JSON response. You can use a tool like Postman to test the API endpoint and see the response.

3. Check the HttpClient configuration: Make sure the HttpClient is configured correctly to send requests to the API endpoint. You can try adding a base URL to the HttpClient configuration to simplify the URL in the Http.GetJsonAsync call.

Here's an example of how you can configure the HttpClient in the Startup.cs file:

```c#
services.AddHttpClient("MyAPI", client =>
{
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://myapi.com/");
});
```

Then, in your component, you can inject the HttpClient and use it like this:

```c#
@inject HttpClient Http

...

empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("api/Employee/Index");
```

Note that the URL is relative to the base address configured in the HttpClient.
