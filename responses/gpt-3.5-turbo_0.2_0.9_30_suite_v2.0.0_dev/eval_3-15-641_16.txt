You can use the Windows API to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. Here's some sample code:

```
Private Declare Function SHGetKnownFolderPath Lib "shell32.dll" (ByRef rfid As Any, ByVal dwFlags As Long, ByVal hToken As Long, ByRef pszPath As Any) As Long

Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrive = "{A52BBA46-E9E1-435f-B3D9-28DAA648C0F6}"
Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro = "{8E74D236-7F35-4720-B138-1FED0B85EA75}"

Public Function GetOneDriveLocalPath() As String
    Dim path As String
    Dim hr As Long
    
    hr = SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_SkyDrive, 0, 0, path)
    If hr <> 0 Then
        hr = SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro, 0, 0, path)
    End If
    
    If hr = 0 Then
        GetOneDriveLocalPath = path
    Else
        GetOneDriveLocalPath = ""
    End If
End Function
```

This code uses the `SHGetKnownFolderPath` function from the Windows API to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. It first tries to get the path for personal OneDrive (`FOLDERID_SkyDrive`), and if that fails, it tries to get the path for OneDrive for Business (`FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro`). If both fail, it returns an empty string.

You can call this function from your macro to get the local path of the OneDrive folder, and then use that path to create folders and files as needed.
