TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework and it doesn't provide a direct way to select child elements. However, you can use the `@layer` directive to define custom styles and then use them in your HTML.

Here's an example of how you can define a custom style using the `@layer` directive:

```
@layer components {
  .section > .child {
    /* your styles here */
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a custom style for the direct children of `.section` with the class `.child`. You can replace `.child` with any class or element that you want to target.

After defining the custom style, you can use it in your HTML like this:

```
<div class="section">
  <div class="child">Child element 1</div>
  <div class="child">Child element 2</div>
</div>
```

This will apply the custom styles to the direct children of `.section` with the class `.child`.
