You can achieve this by iterating over the first `len(rest)` elements of `b` and replacing them with the corresponding elements from `rest`. Then, you can iterate over `last` and replace any element that matches an element in `b` with the corresponding element from `rest`.

Here's the implementation of the `ReplaceElementsByIndex` function:

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    # Replace the first len(rest) elements in b with the corresponding elements from rest
    for i in range(len(rest)):
        b[i] = rest[i]
    
    # Replace any element in last that matches an element in b with the corresponding element from rest
    for i in range(len(last)):
        if last[i] in b:
            last[i] = rest[b.index(last[i])]
    
    return last
```

You can call this function with your example lists as follows:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

replaced_list = ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last)
print(replaced_list)  # Output: [11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```
