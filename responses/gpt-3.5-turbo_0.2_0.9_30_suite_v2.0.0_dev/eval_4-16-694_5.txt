You can use `grep` with a regular expression to match the `lang` attribute value regardless of its position in the HTML tag. Here's an example command that should work for both cases:

```
curl -Ls yahoo.com | grep -oP '(?<=lang=")[^"]+' | head -1
```

This command uses the `-o` option to only output the matched text, and the `-P` option to enable Perl-compatible regular expressions. The regular expression `(?<=lang=")[^"]+` matches any text that comes after `lang="` and before the next `"` character.

Note that this assumes that the `lang` attribute is always enclosed in double quotes. If it's enclosed in single quotes or no quotes at all, you'll need to modify the regular expression accordingly.
