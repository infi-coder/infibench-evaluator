It seems that you are trying to fetch data from a GraphQL API provided by Apollo Sandbox. However, the provided URI in your code is not working. 

You can try replacing the URI with a working one. For example, you can use the following URI:

```
https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io/graphql
```

Also, make sure that you have a stable internet connection and that the GraphQL API is up and running. 

If the issue persists, you can try adding the `fetchPolicy` option to your `useQuery` hook and set it to `network-only`. This will force the query to always fetch data from the network and ignore any cached data. 

Here's how you can add the `fetchPolicy` option:

```javascript
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES, {
  fetchPolicy: 'network-only',
});
```

I hope this helps!
