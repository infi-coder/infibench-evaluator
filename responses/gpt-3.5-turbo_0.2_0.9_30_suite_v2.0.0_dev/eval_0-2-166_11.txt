TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. To select the direct children of a div with class "section" using TailwindCSS, you can use the `>` (direct child) selector in combination with the `class` attribute.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="child">Child 1</div>
  <div class="child">Child 2</div>
</div>
```

To select the direct children of the div with class "section", you can use the following TailwindCSS classes:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="child">Child 1</div>
  <div class="child">Child 2</div>
</div>

<!-- Select direct children of div with class "section" -->
<div class="section > child">...</div>
```

This will select all the direct children of the div with class "section" and apply the styles specified in the `child` class.
