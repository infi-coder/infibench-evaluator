The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Install the zlib development package using the package manager of your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev`.

2. After installing the zlib development package, try installing Pillow again using pip. Run `pip install pillow` in your PyCharm terminal.

If the above steps do not work, you can try installing Pillow from a pre-built binary wheel file. You can download the appropriate wheel file for your system from the PyPI website (https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/#files) and install it using pip. For example, if you are using Python 3.8 on Windows 64-bit, you can download the file `Pillow-6.0.0-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl` and install it using `pip install Pillow-6.0.0-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl`.

I hope this helps!
