To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to do the following:

1. Update your Android Studio to the latest version.
2. Add the following lines to your app's `build.gradle` file:

```
android {
    ...
    buildFeatures {
        compose true
    }
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:1.0.0"
    ...
}
```

3. Sync your project with Gradle.
4. Start using Jetpack Compose in your project.

Note that Jetpack Compose is currently in stable release, so make sure to use the latest version of the dependencies.
