The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0, so you need to make sure that you are using version 5.0 or later of Entity Framework Core. 

You can check the version of Entity Framework Core that you are using by looking at the version number of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package in your project's dependencies. If you are using a version earlier than 5.0, you will need to upgrade to a later version to use the `[Keyless]` attribute.

If you are using version 5.0 or later and still cannot find the `[Keyless]` attribute, make sure that you have included the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational` package in your project's dependencies. The `[Keyless]` attribute is defined in this package.
