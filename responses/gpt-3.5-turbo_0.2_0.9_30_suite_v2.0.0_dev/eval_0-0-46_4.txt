The error message you are seeing is related to ESLint, which is a popular tool for linting and analyzing JavaScript and TypeScript code. It seems that ESLint is trying to read your `tsconfig.json` file but is unable to find it.

To fix this issue, you need to make sure that the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project. If it is already there, try specifying the full path to the `tsconfig.json` file in your `.eslintrc.js` file.

To do this, update the `parserOptions` section of your `.eslintrc.js` file as follows:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This should resolve the issue and allow ESLint to find your `tsconfig.json` file.
