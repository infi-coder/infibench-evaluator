Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly indicates that the class has a dependency on another class and that Spring should provide that dependency when creating an instance of the class. Additionally, using `@Autowired` on the constructor ensures that the dependency is injected at the time of object creation, which can help avoid null pointer exceptions and other issues that can arise when dependencies are not properly initialized. However, it is not mandatory to use `@Autowired` on the constructor, and Spring can still inject dependencies using setter methods or field injection.
