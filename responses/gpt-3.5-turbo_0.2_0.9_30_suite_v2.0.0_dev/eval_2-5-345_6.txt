This error occurs because IntelliJ IDEA is using an older version of Maven than the one used to generate the project. To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Maven settings in IntelliJ IDEA by going to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.
2. In the "Maven home directory" field, make sure that the path points to the same version of Maven used to generate the project.
3. If the path is correct, try clearing the IntelliJ IDEA cache by going to File > Invalidate Caches / Restart.
4. If the issue persists, try deleting the `.idea` folder and the `*.iml` files in the project directory and re-importing the project into IntelliJ IDEA.

If none of these steps work, you may need to update your version of IntelliJ IDEA to a newer version that supports the version of Maven used in the project.
