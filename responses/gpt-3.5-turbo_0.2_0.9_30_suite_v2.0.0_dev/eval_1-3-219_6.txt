Here are some steps you can try to solve the issue:

1. Make sure that the Jupyter package is installed in your conda environment. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: 

   ```
   conda install jupyter
   ```

2. Check if the Jupyter kernel is installed in your environment. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   jupyter kernelspec list
   ```

   This should show you a list of available kernels. Make sure that the kernel for your environment is listed.

3. Try running Jupyter notebook outside of VS Code to see if it works. Open your terminal and activate your conda environment by running:

   ```
   conda activate da38
   ```

   Then run the following command to start Jupyter notebook:

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   If Jupyter notebook starts successfully, then the issue may be with VS Code.

4. If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling both VS Code and Miniconda. Make sure to follow the installation instructions carefully.

Hopefully, one of these steps will solve your issue.
