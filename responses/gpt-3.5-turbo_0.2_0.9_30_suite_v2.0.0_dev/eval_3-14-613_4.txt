It seems like the preview is not associated with any target in your Xcode project. Try adding the `ContentView_Previews` struct to your app target by selecting the file in the project navigator, going to the File Inspector, and making sure the checkbox next to your app target is checked under "Target Membership". If that doesn't work, you can try cleaning your build folder by going to Product > Clean Build Folder and then rebuilding your project.
