To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement the `fill` method in your `RedView` struct. Here's an example:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        Color.red
    }
}
```

Now you can use `RedView()` as a fill for your `Circle` shape in `MyContentView`.
