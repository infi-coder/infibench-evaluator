You can use the following VBA code to get the local path of the OneDrive folder:

```
Sub GetOneDriveLocalPath()
    Dim objShell As Object
    Set objShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
    MsgBox objShell.SpecialFolders("OneDrive")
End Sub
```

This will display a message box with the local path of the OneDrive folder. You can modify this code to search for a specific folder within the OneDrive directory. However, keep in mind that this may be slow if there are a large number of files and folders in the OneDrive directory.
