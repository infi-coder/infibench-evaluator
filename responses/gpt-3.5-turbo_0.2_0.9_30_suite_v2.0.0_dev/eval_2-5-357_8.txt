Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly indicates that the constructor is being used for dependency injection, and it also ensures that the dependencies are injected at the time of object creation, making the object ready for use immediately. Additionally, it also makes the code more testable as it allows for easy mocking of dependencies during unit testing. However, if you prefer to use constructor injection without `@Autowired`, it is also a valid approach.
