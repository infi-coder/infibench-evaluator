The issue with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is present in the `correct` string, which is not what you want. Instead, you should check if all characters in the input string are present in the `correct` string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)

# Example usage
print(checkString("abc123"))  # True
print(checkString("abc!123"))  # False
```

In this code, we use the `all` function to check if all characters in the input string are present in the `correct` string. The `all` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable are true (or if the iterable is empty), and `False` otherwise.

We use a generator expression to iterate over all characters in the input string and check if each character is present in the `correct` string. The `char in correct` expression returns `True` if the character is present in the `correct` string, and `False` otherwise. The `all` function then checks if all these expressions are true.
