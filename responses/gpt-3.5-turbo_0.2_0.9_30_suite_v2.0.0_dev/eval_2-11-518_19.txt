The Rule of 5 is not outdated, as there are still cases where you may need to define these special member functions. 

For example, if your class manages a resource that cannot be handled by a smart pointer, such as a file handle or a network connection, you will need to define a destructor to properly release that resource. Similarly, if your class has non-copyable or non-movable members, you will need to define copy and move constructors and assignment operators to properly handle those members.

While it is true that smart pointers can often be used to manage resources, there are cases where they may not be appropriate or efficient. For example, if you need to manage a large number of small objects, the overhead of using a smart pointer for each one may be too high. In these cases, it may be more efficient to define your own resource management functions.

In summary, while the Rule of 5 may not always be necessary, it is still an important concept to understand and apply when appropriate.
