Enzyme has not yet released an official adapter for React 17, but you can use the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package as a community-supported adapter. Here's how you can adapt the code snippet you provided to work with React 17:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Make sure to install the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package as a dependency in your project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install --save-dev @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Once you've done this, you should be able to write unit tests using Enzyme in your React 17 app.
