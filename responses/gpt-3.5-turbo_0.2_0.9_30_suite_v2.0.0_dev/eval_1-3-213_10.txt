You can try using the `tz_localize` method to set the timezone to `None`. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
df['time'] = df['time'].dt.tz_localize(None)
writer = pd.ExcelWriter(arquivo+'.xlsx', engine='xlsxwriter')
df.to_excel(writer, header=True, index=True)
```

And here's the `removeTimezone` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def removeTimezone(df):
    df['time'] = df['time'].dt.tz_localize(None)
    return df
```

You can call this function with your DataFrame as the argument and it will return the modified DataFrame with the timezone removed from the "time" column.
