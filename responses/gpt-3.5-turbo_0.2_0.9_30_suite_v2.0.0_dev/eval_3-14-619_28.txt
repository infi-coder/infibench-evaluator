The issue might be that the `ContentView` struct is not being updated when the `isSelected` variable changes. You can try wrapping the `Text` view in a `VStack` or `Group` to force the view to update:

```
swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Binding var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Group {
                Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
