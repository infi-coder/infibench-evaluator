Your code looks correct. However, if the user denies the location access, the `getCurrentPosition` method will not execute the success callback function. Therefore, you need to add an error callback function to handle the case when the user denies the location access. Here is the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

With this code, if the user denies the location access, the error callback function will be executed and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console.
