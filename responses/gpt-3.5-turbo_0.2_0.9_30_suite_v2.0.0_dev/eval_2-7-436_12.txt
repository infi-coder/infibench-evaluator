The error message suggests that the current version of PHP and Composer installed on your system are not compatible with Laravel 9. 

Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher and Composer 2.0 or higher. You can check your current PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -v
```

To upgrade your PHP version, you can follow the instructions provided by your operating system's package manager or upgrade manually.

To upgrade Composer to the latest version, you can run the following command:

```bash
composer self-update
```

After upgrading both PHP and Composer, try running the `composer create-project` command again to install Laravel 9.
