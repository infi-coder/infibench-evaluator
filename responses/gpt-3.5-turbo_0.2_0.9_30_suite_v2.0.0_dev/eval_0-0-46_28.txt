The error message you are seeing is related to ESLint, which is a popular linting tool for JavaScript and TypeScript. It is used to analyze your code for potential errors and style issues.

Based on the information you provided, it seems like ESLint is unable to find your `tsconfig.json` file. This file is used by TypeScript to configure the compiler options, and it is also used by ESLint to understand your project's TypeScript configuration.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project. If it is not, you will need to update the `parserOptions.project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the correct location.

2. Check that the path to your `tsconfig.json` file is correct in your `.eslintrc.js` file. In your current configuration, the `parserOptions.project` property is set to `"tsconfig.json"`, which assumes that the file is located in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file. If your `tsconfig.json` file is located in a different directory, you will need to update this property accordingly.

3. Install the necessary ESLint plugins and dependencies. Based on your `.eslintrc.js` file, you are using the `@typescript-eslint/parser` parser and the `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` plugin. Make sure that these are installed in your project by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
   ```

   This will install the necessary dependencies in your project's `devDependencies` section of your `package.json` file.

4. Reload VSCode. Sometimes, VSCode can have issues with caching the configuration files, so it's a good idea to reload the editor after making changes to your configuration files.

Once you have completed these steps, you should no longer see the error message in your `.ts` files. If you continue to have issues, you may need to provide more information about your project's directory structure and configuration files.
