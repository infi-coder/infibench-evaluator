The issue you are facing could be due to a compatibility issue between the Selenium VBA library and Excel 2019. Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium VBA library installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Check if the reference to the Selenium library is correctly set in your Excel VBA project. To do this, go to the VBA editor, click on Tools > References, and make sure that the reference to the Selenium library is checked.

3. Try running the code in a different browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, to see if the issue persists.

4. Try running the code on a different machine with Excel 2019 installed to see if the issue is specific to your machine.

5. Try running the code with administrative privileges to see if it resolves the issue.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to reach out to the Selenium VBA community for further assistance.
