Yes, the above comment is true/correct. 

In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's properties and set up any necessary resources. 

Unlike regular methods, constructors cannot be called explicitly like a function. They are invoked automatically when a new object is created using the `new` keyword. 

Therefore, it is not correct to say that a constructor can be called like a regular function.
