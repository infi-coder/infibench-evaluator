You can disable the ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and keep them in the order they are written in the source file. 

If you don't have a `.clang-format` file yet, you can create one in the root directory of your project and add the above line to it. 

Keep in mind that disabling the sorting of includes may lead to potential issues with third-party libraries that require a specific include order. It's recommended to follow the recommended include order whenever possible.
