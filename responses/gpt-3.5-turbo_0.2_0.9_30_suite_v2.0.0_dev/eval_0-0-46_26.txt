The error message indicates that ESLint is unable to find the `tsconfig.json` file. This is because the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project, but the `.eslintrc.js` file is located in the `src` directory.

To fix this issue, you need to update the `parserOptions.project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the correct location of the `tsconfig.json` file. You can do this by updating the value of the `project` property to `"../tsconfig.json"`, like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "../tsconfig.json",
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  // ...
};
```

This assumes that your `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project. If it is located in a different directory, you will need to update the path accordingly.

After making this change, you should no longer see the error message in your `.ts` files.
