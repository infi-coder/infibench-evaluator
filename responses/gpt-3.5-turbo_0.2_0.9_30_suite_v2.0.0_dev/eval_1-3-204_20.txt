The `rename()` method is used to rename the columns of a DataFrame. In your code, you are trying to use the `rename()` method on a Pandas Series object, which is returned by the `mean()` method.

To achieve your desired result, you can rename the "p" column to "mean" before applying the `groupby()` and `mean()` methods. Here's the modified code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
    df = df.rename(columns={"p": "mean"})
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["mean"].mean()
    return avg
```

In this modified code, we first rename the "p" column to "mean" using the `rename()` method. Then we apply the `groupby()` method on the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "mean" column using the `mean()` method.

Note that the `rename()` method returns a new DataFrame with the renamed columns, so we need to assign the result back to the original DataFrame variable `df`.
