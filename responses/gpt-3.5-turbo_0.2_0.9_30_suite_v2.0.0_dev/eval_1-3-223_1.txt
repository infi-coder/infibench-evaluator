You can use the `pip` module in Python to check if a package is at its latest version. Here's an implementation of the `checkVersion` function that takes the package name as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the package is at its latest version or not:

```python
import pip

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the package information
    package_info = pip.get_installed_distributions()
    
    # Check if the package is installed
    for package in package_info:
        if package.project_name == pkgName:
            # Check if the package is up-to-date
            latest_version = pip.get_latest_version(pkgName)
            if package.version == latest_version:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    
    # If the package is not installed, return False
    return False
```

This function first checks if the package is installed by iterating through the list of installed packages and comparing their names to the given package name. If the package is installed, it then checks if it is up-to-date by comparing its version to the latest version available on PyPI. If the package is not installed, the function returns False.
