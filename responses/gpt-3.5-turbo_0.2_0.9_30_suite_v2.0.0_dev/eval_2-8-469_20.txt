The error message indicates that `protoc` is unable to determine the Go import path for the generated code. To fix this, you need to specify the Go package name in the `.proto` file using the `option go_package` directive. 

Here's an example of how to modify your `simple.proto` file to include the `go_package` option:

```go
syntax="proto3";

option go_package = "github.com/your-username/your-repo/your-package-name";

package main;

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

Replace `github.com/your-username/your-repo/your-package-name` with the actual import path for your Go package.

After making this change, you can run the `protoc` command again:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. simple.proto
```

This should generate the Go code for your `Person` message in the current directory.
