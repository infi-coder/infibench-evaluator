For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server's clock is out of sync with the client's clock, causing the token to expire before it should. Another possibility is that the session is not being properly persisted between requests, causing the server to generate a new token on each request. You could try increasing the SESSION_LIFETIME to see if that helps, or try using a different session driver (such as database or redis) to see if that resolves the issue.

For the second issue, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used by the server is not compatible with the version expected by the client. You could try changing the encryption method to 'tls' instead of 'ssl', as that is the more common encryption method used for SMTP. Additionally, you could try changing the port to 465, which is the default port for SMTP over SSL/TLS. If those changes do not work, you may need to contact the email provider to ensure that the correct encryption method and port are being used.
