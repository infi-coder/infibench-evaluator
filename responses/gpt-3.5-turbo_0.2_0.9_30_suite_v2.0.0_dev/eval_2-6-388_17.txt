The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you will not have access to this attribute.

To use the `[Keyless]` attribute, you need to make sure you have installed the Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later package in your project. You can do this by adding the following package reference to your project file:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore" Version="5.0.0" />
```

After installing the package, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class:

```c#
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

Then, you can add the `DbSet` property to your `DbContext` class:

```c#
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

And use it like this:

```c#
var results = _context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw("SELECT Name, Age FROM MyView").ToList();
```
