If you want to use the same version of Java that works with the Maven task, you can specify the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the location of the JDK that Maven is using.

To do this, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk
```

Replace `/path/to/your/jdk` with the actual path to your JDK installation.

Alternatively, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in your operating system's settings or in your shell's configuration file (e.g. `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).

Once you have set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, you can run the Maven wrapper as usual and it should use the correct version of Java.
