One solution to this problem is to use multiprocessing instead of threading. Multiprocessing allows you to run multiple processes simultaneously, which can be useful when dealing with infinite loops. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use multiprocessing:

```python
from multiprocessing import Process

app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
database=db.dataBase()
homepage=hp.homepage(database)
homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()

def run_data_mining():
    dataMiningScript.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p1 = Process(target=run_data_mining)
    p1.start()
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

In this modified code, we define a new function `run_data_mining` that simply calls the `run` method of the `dataMiningScript` object. We then create a new process `p1` that runs this function using the `Process` class from the `multiprocessing` module. Finally, we start the process using the `start` method and run the Dash app as usual.

Note that you may need to modify the `financeData` class to make it compatible with multiprocessing. For example, you may need to use a `Queue` to communicate between the two processes.
