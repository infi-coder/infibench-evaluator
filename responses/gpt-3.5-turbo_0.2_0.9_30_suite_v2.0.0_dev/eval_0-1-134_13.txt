It sounds like you may be trying to use a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less. These preprocessors allow you to write CSS in a more efficient and organized way by using variables, nesting, and other features.

In Sass, for example, you can use the `&` symbol to reference the parent selector. So if you have a class called `.button` and you want to style a hover state, you can write:

```
.button {
  background-color: blue;

  &:hover {
    background-color: red;
  }
}
```

This will compile to:

```
.button {
  background-color: blue;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: red;
}
```

If you're not using a preprocessor and you're just trying to write regular CSS, you can still use the `.` selector to target classes. For example:

```
.my-class {
  background-color: blue;
}
```

This will apply the `background-color` property to any element with the `my-class` class.

If you're still having trouble, it may be helpful to provide more information about what you're trying to do and what specifically isn't working.
