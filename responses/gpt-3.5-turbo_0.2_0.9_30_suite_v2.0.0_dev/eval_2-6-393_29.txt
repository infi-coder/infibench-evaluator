The error message is indicating that you are trying to use the `Gender` property as a regular property on the `User` entity, but it is actually configured as a navigation property to the `Gender` entity. 

To fix this error, you should remove the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` from your `OnModelCreating` method. This line is trying to create an index on the `Gender` property, which is not allowed because it is a navigation property.

After removing that line, you can try running the `dotnet ef add migration User` command again and it should work without any errors.
