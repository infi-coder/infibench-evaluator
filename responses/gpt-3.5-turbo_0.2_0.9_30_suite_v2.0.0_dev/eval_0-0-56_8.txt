It looks like you are exposing the correct port in your Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file, so the issue might be with the way you are running the container.

When you run the container with `docker-compose run`, it creates a new container instance each time, which means that any changes you make to the container (such as starting the vite server) will not persist.

Instead, you should use `docker-compose up` to start the container and keep it running in the background. This will allow you to start the vite server inside the container and access it from your host machine.

Here's how you can modify your Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file to use `docker-compose up`:

Dockerfile:

```
FROM node:16.10.0

RUN npm install -g npm@8.1.3
RUN npm install -g @vue/cli@4.5.15

RUN mkdir /srv/app && chown node:node /srv/app

USER node

WORKDIR /srv/app

CMD ["npm", "run", "vite"]
```

docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    container_name: myapp
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

With these changes, you can start the container with `docker-compose up` and it will automatically start the vite server inside the container. You should be able to access the server at `localhost:8080` on your host machine.
