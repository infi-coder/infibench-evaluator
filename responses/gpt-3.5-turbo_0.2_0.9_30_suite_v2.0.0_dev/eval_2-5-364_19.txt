You can specify the Java version to use with the Maven wrapper by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable before running the wrapper command. 

For example, if you want to use Java 8, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` variable to the path of your Java 8 installation:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java8
```

Then, you can run the Maven wrapper command as usual:

```
./mvnw clean install
```

This should use the specified Java version instead of the older one that is causing issues.
