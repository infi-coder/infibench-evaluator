You can add your existing SSH key to Git Bash by following these steps:

1. Open Git Bash and navigate to your home directory by typing `cd ~`.
2. Create a new directory called `.ssh` by typing `mkdir .ssh`.
3. Move your SSH key file to the `.ssh` directory by typing `mv D:/keys/id_rsa ~/.ssh/`.
4. Set the correct permissions for the SSH key file by typing `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

That's it! Your SSH key should now be available for use in Git Bash.
