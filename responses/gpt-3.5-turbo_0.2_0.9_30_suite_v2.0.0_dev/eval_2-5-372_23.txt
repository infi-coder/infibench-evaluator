It seems that there might be a conflict between the version of Hibernate Validator that is being used by your Spring Boot application and the version that is being resolved by Maven. 

You can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from your Spring Boot starter dependencies and explicitly add the version that you want to use. For example, you can add the following to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.5.Final-redhat-2</version>
</dependency>
```

This will exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from the Spring Boot starter validation dependency and add the version that you want to use explicitly.

Alternatively, you can try to upgrade your Spring Boot version to a version that uses Hibernate Validator 6.x, which might resolve the conflict.
