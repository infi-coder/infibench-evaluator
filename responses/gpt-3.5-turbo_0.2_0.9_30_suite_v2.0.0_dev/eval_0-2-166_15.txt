TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework and does not provide a way to select direct children of an element. However, you can achieve this by using the `@layer` directive to define your own custom CSS rules.

Here's an example of how you can define a custom rule to select direct children of a `div` element with class `section`:

```css
@layer components {
  .section > div {
    /* Your CSS rules here */
  }
}
```

You can then use this custom rule in your HTML code like this:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div>Direct child 1</div>
  <div>Direct child 2</div>
</div>
```

Note that you need to include this custom rule in your TailwindCSS configuration file for it to be compiled. You can do this by adding the following code to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  variants: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    function ({ addComponents }) {
      addComponents({
        '@layer components': {
          '.section > div': {
            /* Your CSS rules here */
          },
        },
      });
    },
  ],
};
```
