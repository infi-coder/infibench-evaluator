This warning is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled. To fix this, you need to enable security in Elasticsearch.

Here are the steps to enable security in Elasticsearch:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` in a text editor. You can find this file in the Elasticsearch installation directory.

2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:
```
xpack.security.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After you have enabled security in Elasticsearch, you will need to update your Searchkick configuration to include the Elasticsearch username and password. You can do this by adding the following lines to your `config/initializers/searchkick.rb` file:
```
Searchkick.client_options = {
  username: "elastic",
  password: "your_password"
}
```
Replace `your_password` with the password you set for the Elasticsearch user.

Note: If you are using Elasticsearch version 7.11 or later, you will need to use the `elastic` user instead of the `searchkick` user.
