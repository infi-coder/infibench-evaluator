With Font Awesome 5, you need to change the font family to `"Font Awesome 5 Free"` or `"Font Awesome 5 Pro"` depending on which version you are using. Also, the icon code has changed from `\f107` to `\f054`. So the updated CSS code would be:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f054";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

Make sure you have included the Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project and the font files are in the correct directory.
