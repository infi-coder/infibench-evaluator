Sure! The code you provided is almost correct, but you need to use the `keyof` keyword to create a union of all the keys in `fruit` and `color`. Here's the corrected code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in keyof (typeof fruit | typeof color)]: key extends fruit ? number : boolean
}
```

This creates a mapped type where each key in the union of `fruit` and `color` is mapped to either a `number` or a `boolean`, depending on whether it extends `fruit` or not.
