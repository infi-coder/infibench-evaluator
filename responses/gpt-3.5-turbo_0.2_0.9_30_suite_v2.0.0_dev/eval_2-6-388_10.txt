The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0, so you need to make sure that you are using EF Core 5.0 or later in your project. 

To check the version of EF Core that you are using, you can open the NuGet Package Manager Console and run the following command:

```
Get-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -ListAvailable
```

This will show you a list of available versions of EF Core. Make sure that you have version 5.0 or later installed in your project.

If you are using an earlier version of EF Core, you can either upgrade to version 5.0 or later, or you can add a primary key to your keyless entity to use it with `DbSet`.
