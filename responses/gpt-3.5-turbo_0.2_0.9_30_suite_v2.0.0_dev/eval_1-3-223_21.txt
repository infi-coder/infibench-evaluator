To check if a package is at its latest version programmatically in a script and return a true or false, you can use the `pip` package in Python. Here's the `checkVersion` function that takes the package name `pkgName` as the argument and returns a boolean:

```python
import pip

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the latest version of the package
    latest_version = str(pip.get_installed_distributions()[0]).split(' ')[1]
    # Check if the package is at its latest version
    if pkgName in str(pip.get_installed_distributions()) and latest_version == pip.__version__:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function first gets the latest version of the package using `pip.get_installed_distributions()` and then checks if the package is installed and at its latest version. If the package is installed and at its latest version, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
