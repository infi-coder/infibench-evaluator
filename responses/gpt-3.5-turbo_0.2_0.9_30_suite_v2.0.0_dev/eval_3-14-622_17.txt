To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement the `func makeBody(configuration: Self.Configuration) -> Self.Body` method. In your case, you can simply make `RedView` conform to `ShapeStyle` by implementing the `makeBody` method like this:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: ShapeStyle.Configuration) -> some View {
        Color.red
    }
}
```

Then you can use `RedView()` directly as the fill for your `Circle`:

```
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedView())
    }
}
```
