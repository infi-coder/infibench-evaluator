Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r'[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

Here, we first check if the input string is empty or not. If it is empty, we return an empty string. Otherwise, we split the input string using regular expression `[-_]` to handle both dash and underscore delimiters. Then, we capitalize the first letter of each word except the first word and join them to form the camel case string. Finally, we return the camel case string.
