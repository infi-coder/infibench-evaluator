TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means that it provides pre-defined classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. In this case, you can use the `child` selector provided by TailwindCSS to target the direct children of a `div` element with a specific class.

Here's an example of how you can use the `child` selector to target the direct children of a `div` element with the class `section`:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="child">Child 1</div>
  <div class="child">Child 2</div>
</div>
```

```css
/* Using the child selector */
.section > .child {
  /* Styles for direct children of .section */
}
```

In the example above, the `>` symbol is used to target the direct children of the `div` element with the class `section`. The `.child` class is used to style the direct children of the `div` element with the class `section`.
