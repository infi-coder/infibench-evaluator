The error you are experiencing may be due to compatibility issues between the Selenium add-in and Excel 2019. Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that the Selenium add-in is enabled in Excel 2019. You can check this by going to File > Options > Add-ins > Manage: Excel Add-ins > Go. Then, make sure that the checkbox next to Selenium is checked.

2. Try using a different version of the Selenium add-in. You can download different versions of the add-in from the Selenium website.

3. Try using a different browser driver. For example, instead of using the Internet Explorer driver, try using the Chrome or Firefox driver.

4. Make sure that the correct version of the browser driver is installed. The version of the browser driver should match the version of the browser you are using.

5. Try running the code on a different machine with Excel 2019 installed to see if the issue is specific to your machine.

I hope one of these suggestions helps you resolve the issue.
