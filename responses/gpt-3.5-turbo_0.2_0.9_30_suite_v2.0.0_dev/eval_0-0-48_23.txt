Sure! The code you provided is almost correct, but you need to use the `|` operator instead of `,` when defining the type `FruitsAndColors`. Here's the corrected code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This creates an intersection type that combines the two object types, one with numeric properties for each fruit and the other with boolean properties for each color.
