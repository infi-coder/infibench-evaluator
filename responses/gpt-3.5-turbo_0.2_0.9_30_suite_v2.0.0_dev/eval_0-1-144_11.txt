You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `.accordion-button::after` pseudo-element and setting its `border-color` property to green. Here's the CSS code you can add to your stylesheet:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    border-color: green !important;
}
```

Note that the `!important` keyword is used to override the default Bootstrap styles. If you have other styles that affect the same element, you may need to adjust the specificity of your CSS selector.
