Yes, we can achieve this using pandas' `groupby` and `cumsum` functions. Here's the `aggregation` function that should do what you're looking for:

```python
def aggregation(df):
    # Filter the DataFrame to only include rows where type is 'deposit'
    deposits = df[df['type'] == 'deposit']
    
    # Group the deposits by exchange and calculate the cumulative sum of the values
    deposits['balance'] = deposits.groupby('exchange')['value'].cumsum()
    
    # Merge the deposits DataFrame back into the original DataFrame
    df = pd.merge(df, deposits[['exchange', 'type', 'value', 'balance']], on=['exchange', 'type', 'value'], how='left')
    
    # Forward-fill the balance column to fill in any missing values
    df['balance'] = df.groupby('exchange')['balance'].ffill()
    
    return df
```

This function first filters the DataFrame to only include rows where `type` is 'deposit'. It then groups these rows by `exchange` and calculates the cumulative sum of the `value` column using the `cumsum` function. The resulting DataFrame is then merged back into the original DataFrame using the `merge` function, and the `balance` column is forward-filled to fill in any missing values. Finally, the updated DataFrame is returned.
