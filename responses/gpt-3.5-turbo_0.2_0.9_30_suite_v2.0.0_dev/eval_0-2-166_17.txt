TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework and does not provide a way to select direct children of an element. However, you can use the `@layer` directive to define your own custom styles.

Here's an example of how you can define a custom style to select direct children of an element:

```css
@layer utilities {
  .section > .child {
    /* your styles here */
  }
}
```

You can then use this custom style in your HTML:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="child">Direct child</div>
  <div>Not a direct child</div>
</div>
```

Note that this approach will generate a new CSS class for each direct child selector you define, which may result in a larger CSS file.
