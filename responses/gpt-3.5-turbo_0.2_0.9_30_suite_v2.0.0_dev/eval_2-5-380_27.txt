To use Swagger UI with Spring Boot, you need to make sure that you have the following configurations in your application:

1. Make sure that you have the `@EnableSwagger2` annotation on your main Spring Boot application class.

2. Make sure that you have the `@Configuration` annotation on your Swagger configuration class.

3. Make sure that you have the `@Bean` annotation on your `Docket` bean method in your Swagger configuration class.

Here's an example of how your Swagger configuration class should look like:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableSwagger2
public class SwaggerConfig {

    @Bean
    public Docket api() {
        return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2)
                .select()
                .apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.any())
                .paths(PathSelectors.any())
                .build();
    }
}
```

Also, make sure that you have the correct URL for Swagger UI. In Spring Boot 2.x, the URL is `/swagger-ui/index.html`. In Spring Boot 1.x, the URL is `/swagger-ui.html`.

If you have followed these steps and still have issues, try to check the console logs for any errors or conflicts with other dependencies.
