The issue might be related to the compatibility of the Selenium WebDriver with Excel 2019. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium WebDriver installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Check if the reference to the Selenium WebDriver is correctly set in your Excel VBA project. To do this, go to the VBA editor, click on Tools > References, and make sure that the reference to the Selenium type library is checked.

3. Try using a different browser driver. For example, instead of using the Internet Explorer driver, try using the Chrome driver or the Edge driver.

4. Try running the code in compatibility mode. To do this, right-click on the Excel shortcut, select Properties, go to the Compatibility tab, and check the box for "Run this program in compatibility mode for" and select the version of Excel that was previously working.

5. If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling Excel 2019 and the Selenium WebDriver.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue.
