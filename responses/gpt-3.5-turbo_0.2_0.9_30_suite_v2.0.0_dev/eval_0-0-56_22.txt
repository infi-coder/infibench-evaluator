It seems that the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost`, which means that it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0`.

To do this, you can modify the `server.host` option in your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0'
    }
})
```

This will bind the Vite server to all available network interfaces, which should allow you to access it from your host machine.

Also, make sure that you are running the Vite server with the correct command inside the Docker container. You should use the `npm run vite` command, not the `npm run dev` command that you use for the Vue CLI server.
