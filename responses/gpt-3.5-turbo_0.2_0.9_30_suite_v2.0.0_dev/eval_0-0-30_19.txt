As of Enzyme version 3.11.0, there is no official adapter for React 17 yet. However, you can use the adapter for React 16 with React 17 without any issues. Here's the updated code snippet:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Note that you need to install the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package separately, as it is not included in the Enzyme package.

Also, keep in mind that Enzyme is no longer officially supported by the React team, and it is recommended to use the React Testing Library instead.
