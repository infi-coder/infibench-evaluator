Your code looks correct. However, if the user denies the location access, the `getCurrentPosition()` method will throw an error. Therefore, you need to add a second parameter to the `getCurrentPosition()` method to handle the error. Here is the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

With this code, if the user allows the location access, the `console.log("Location accessed")` will be executed. If the user denies the location access, the `console.log("User not allowed")` will be executed. If the geolocation is not supported by the browser, the `console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.")` will be executed.
