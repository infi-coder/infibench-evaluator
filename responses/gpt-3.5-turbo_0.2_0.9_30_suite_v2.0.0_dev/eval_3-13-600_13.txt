You can disable the animation in ViewPager2 by setting the `offscreenPageLimit` to 0. This will prevent ViewPager2 from preloading any pages and will show the new fragment immediately without any animation. Here's an example:

```
viewPager2.offscreenPageLimit = 0
```

You can also disable the animation by setting the `isUserInputEnabled` property to false, but you mentioned that you have already disabled user input for the ViewPager2.
