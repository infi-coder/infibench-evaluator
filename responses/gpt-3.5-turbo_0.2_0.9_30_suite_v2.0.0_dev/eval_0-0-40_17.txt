It seems like there is an issue with the line endings in the `npm` file. You can fix this issue by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install dos2unix
sudo dos2unix /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm
```

This will install the `dos2unix` package and convert the line endings of the `npm` file to Unix format. After running this command, try running `npm -v` again and it should work properly.
