To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to make sure that your project is using Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) or later. Then, you can add the following dependencies to your app's build.gradle file:

```
dependencies {
    // Jetpack Compose
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:1.0.0'
}
```

After adding these dependencies, you can start using Jetpack Compose in your project by creating Composable functions and using them in your UI. You can also refer to the official Jetpack Compose documentation for more information and examples.
