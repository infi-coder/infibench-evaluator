Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended way of injecting dependencies in Spring. It makes the code more readable and easier to maintain. It also ensures that all required dependencies are injected at the time of object creation, which helps to avoid null pointer exceptions. However, if you are using Spring 4.3 or later, you can omit the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor as long as there is only one constructor in the class. Spring will automatically detect the constructor and inject the dependencies.
