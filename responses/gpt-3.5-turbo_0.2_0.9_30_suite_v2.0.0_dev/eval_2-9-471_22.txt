To import images in a React component with TypeScript and Parcel, you need to do the following:

1. Create a declaration file for the image file extension. In your case, you have already created `index.d.ts` in the `src` folder. Make sure it contains the following code:

```
declare module '*.jpg';
```

2. In your `tsconfig.json` file, add the following line to the `"compilerOptions"` object:

```
"resolveJsonModule": true
```

This is necessary because Parcel treats image files as JSON modules.

3. Import the image in your component like this:

```
import * as React from 'react';
import image from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  return <img src={image} alt="My Image" />;
}

export default Box;
```

Note that you should use `import image from '../assets/image.jpg'` instead of `import * as img from '../assets/image.jpg'`.

4. Rename your `index.d.ts` file to something else, e.g., `declaration.d.ts`. TypeScript is ignoring `index.d.ts` because it assumes that it is generated from `index.tsx`, which is more likely to be up to date.

After following these steps, TypeScript should no longer throw the `Cannot find module` error.
