Yes, in Flutter you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here's an example:

```
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        height: 100,
        color: Colors.blue,
      ),
    ),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        height: 100,
        color: Colors.green,
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

This code will create a `Row` with two `Container` widgets separated by a vertical line. The `VerticalDivider` widget is used to draw the line, and you can customize its color, thickness, and width.
