The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for installing Pillow from source. 

To fix this issue, you can try installing the pre-built binary wheel of Pillow using the following command:

```
pip install pillow --global-option="build_ext" --global-option="--disable-jpeg"
```

If that doesn't work, you can try installing the required dependencies manually by following the instructions provided in the error message:

```
The headers or library files could not be found for zlib,
a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source.

Please see the install instructions at:
   https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
```

Once you have installed the required dependencies, you can try installing Pillow again using `pip install pillow`.
