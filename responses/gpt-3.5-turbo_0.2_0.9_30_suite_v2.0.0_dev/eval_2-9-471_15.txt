To import images in a React component with TypeScript and Parcel, you need to do the following:

1. Create a `.d.ts` file for the image file extension (in this case, `.jpg`). Name it something other than `index.d.ts`, e.g., `declaration.d.ts`. This file should contain the following code:

```typescript
declare module '*.jpg' {
  const value: any;
  export default value;
}
```

2. In `tsconfig.json`, add the following line to the `"include"` array:

```json
"include": ["src/**/*", "declaration.d.ts"]
```

This tells TypeScript to include the `declaration.d.ts` file in the compilation process.

3. In your React component, import the image like this:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import image from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  return <img src={image} alt="My Image" />;
};

export default Box;
```

Note that you should use `import image from ...` instead of `import * as image from ...`. Also, you can use the `image` variable directly as the `src` attribute of an `img` tag.

With these changes, TypeScript should be able to find and import the image without any errors.
