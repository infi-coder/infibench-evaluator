The error message is caused by the fact that you are trying to create an index on the `Gender` property of the `User` entity, which is not allowed because `Gender` is a navigation property.

To solve this problem, you can remove the following line from your `OnModelCreating` method:

```c#
user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);
```

This line is not necessary because EF Core will automatically create an index for the foreign key property `GenderId` when you configure the relationship between `User` and `Gender`.

After removing the line, you can run the `dotnet ef add migration User` command again and it should work without any errors.
