The error message you are seeing indicates that ESLint is unable to find the `tsconfig.json` file. This is because the `tsconfig.json` file is not in the root directory of your project, but rather in the `src` directory.

To fix this issue, you need to update the `parserOptions.project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the correct location of the `tsconfig.json` file. You can do this by modifying the `parserOptions` section of your `.eslintrc.js` file as follows:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./src/tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This assumes that your `tsconfig.json` file is located in the `src` directory of your project. If it is located in a different directory, you will need to update the path accordingly.

Once you have made this change, save the file and restart VSCode. The error message should disappear, and you should no longer see red lines in your `.ts` files.
