It looks like the issue might be related to the URI you're using for your Apollo Client. The URI you're using (`https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io`) is a public test API provided by Apollo, and it might not be working properly at the moment.

To test if this is the issue, you can try using a different GraphQL API, such as the one provided by SpaceX:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://api.spacex.land/graphql/',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

If this works, then the issue is likely with the test API you were using before. If it doesn't work, then there might be another issue with your code or setup.

Also, make sure that your device or emulator has an active internet connection, as the Apollo Client needs to make a network request to fetch data.
