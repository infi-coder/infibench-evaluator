You can use the `pip` module in Python to check if a package is at its latest version. Here's a function `checkVersion` that takes the package name as an argument and returns `True` if the package is at its latest version, and `False` otherwise:

```python
import pip

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the latest version of the package
    latest_version = None
    try:
        package = pip.get_installed_distributions()
        for pkg in package:
            if pkg.key == pkgName:
                latest_version = pkg.version
                break
    except:
        pass

    # Check if the package is at its latest version
    if latest_version is None:
        return False
    else:
        try:
            pip_version = pip.get_installed_distributions(pkgName)[0].version
            if pip_version == latest_version:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        except:
            return False
```

You can call this function with the package name as the argument, like this:

```python
if checkVersion('gekko'):
    print('Package is at its latest version')
else:
    print('Package is not at its latest version')
```
