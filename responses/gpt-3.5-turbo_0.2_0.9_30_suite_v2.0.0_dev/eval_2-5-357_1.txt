Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. By using `@Autowired` on the constructor, you are explicitly stating that the class requires the dependency to function properly. This also makes it easier to write unit tests for the class, as you can easily mock the dependency in the constructor. Additionally, using `@Autowired` on the constructor ensures that the dependency is injected at the time of object creation, which can help avoid null pointer exceptions.
