Here's the revised code for the `pig_latin` function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
  words = text.split()
  pig_words = []
  for word in words:
    endString = str(word[1:]).lower()
    startString = str(word[0]).lower()
    pig_word = endString + startString + 'ay'
    pig_words.append(pig_word)
  return ' '.join(pig_words)
```

The changes made are:

- Initialized an empty list `pig_words` to store the pig Latin words.
- Changed `endString` to include all characters from the second character to the end of the word, and converted it to lowercase.
- Changed `startString` to include only the first character of the word, and converted it to lowercase.
- Concatenated `endString`, `startString`, and `'ay'` to form the pig Latin word `pig_word`.
- Appended `pig_word` to the `pig_words` list.
- Finally, returned the pig Latin sentence by joining the `pig_words` list with a space separator.

With these changes, the function should now correctly convert the input text to pig Latin.
