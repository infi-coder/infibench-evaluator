In order to use Swagger UI with Spring Boot, you need to make sure that you have the following configurations in your application:

1. Make sure that you have the `@EnableSwagger2` annotation on your main Spring Boot application class.

2. Make sure that you have the `@Configuration` annotation on your Swagger configuration class.

3. Make sure that you have the `@Bean` annotation on your `Docket` bean method in your Swagger configuration class.

Here's an example of how your Swagger configuration class should look like:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableSwagger2
public class SwaggerConfig {

    @Bean
    public Docket api() {
        return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2)
                .select()
                .apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.basePackage("com.example.controller"))
                .paths(PathSelectors.any())
                .build();
    }
}
```

Make sure that you replace `com.example.controller` with the base package of your Spring Boot application.

If you have already done all of the above, then you may need to check your application's logs to see if there are any errors related to Swagger UI.
