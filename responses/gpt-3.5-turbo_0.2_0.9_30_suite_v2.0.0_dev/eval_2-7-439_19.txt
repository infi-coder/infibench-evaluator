The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server.

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -m | grep zip
   ```

   If the extension is already installed, you should see `zip` in the output.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The method for installing the extension depends on your operating system and the PHP version you are using. Here are some examples:

   - For Ubuntu and PHP 7.4:

     ```
     sudo apt-get install php7.4-zip
     ```

   - For CentOS and PHP 7.4:

     ```
     sudo yum install php74-php-zip
     ```

   - For macOS and PHP 7.4 (with Homebrew):

     ```
     brew install php@7.4
     brew install php@7.4-zip
     ```

3. After installing the extension, restart your web server to apply the changes.

   - For Apache:

     ```
     sudo service apache2 restart
     ```

   - For Nginx:

     ```
     sudo service nginx restart
     ```

Once the extension is installed and your web server is restarted, you should be able to use the `ZipArchive` class in your PHP code without any issues.
