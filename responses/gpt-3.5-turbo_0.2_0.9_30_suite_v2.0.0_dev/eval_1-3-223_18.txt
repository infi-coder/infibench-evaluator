You can use the `pip` module in Python to check if a package is at its latest version. Here's an implementation of the `checkVersion` function that takes the package name as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the package is at its latest version or not:

```python
import pip

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the package information
    pkgInfo = pip.get_installed_distributions()
    
    # Find the package with the given name
    for pkg in pkgInfo:
        if pkg.key == pkgName:
            # Check if the package is at its latest version
            latestVersion = pip.get_latest_version(pkgName)
            return pkg.version == latestVersion
    
    # Package not found
    return False
```

You can call this function with the name of the package you want to check, like this:

```python
isLatest = checkVersion('gekko')
print(isLatest)
```

This will print `True` if the package is at its latest version, and `False` otherwise.
