To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to define a `fill` method that takes a `ContentShape` and returns a `some View`. Here's an example implementation:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func makeView(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .foregroundColor(.red)
    }
}
```

Then you can use it like this:

```
Circle()
    .fill(RedView())
```
