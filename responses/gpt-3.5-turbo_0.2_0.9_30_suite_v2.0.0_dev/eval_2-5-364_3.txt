You can specify the path to the Java executable that you want to use by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. 

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Determine the path to the Java executable that you want to use. For example, if you want to use the Java executable located at `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/java`, then that is the path you will use.

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of the Java executable. For example, if you are using a Unix-based system, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` variable by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
   ```

   If you are using a Windows-based system, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` variable by following these steps:
   
   - Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables".
   - Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
   - Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
   - Under "System Variables", click on "New".
   - Enter `JAVA_HOME` as the variable name and the path to the Java executable as the variable value.
   - Click "OK" to save the changes.

3. Run the Maven wrapper using the `./mvnw` command. Maven will now use the Java executable specified by the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

Note that if you are using a build tool like Gradle or Ant, you may need to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in the build script as well.
