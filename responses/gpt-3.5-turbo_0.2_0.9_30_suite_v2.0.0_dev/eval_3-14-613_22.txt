This error message suggests that the preview code is not associated with any target in your Xcode project. To fix this, try the following steps:

1. Make sure that your Xcode project has at least one target.
2. Check that the preview code is included in the target by selecting the file and checking the "Target Membership" section in the File Inspector.
3. Clean the build folder by selecting "Product" from the menu bar, then "Clean Build Folder".
4. Try running the preview again.

If the issue persists, you may need to create a new Xcode project and copy your source files over.
