The error message suggests that the response from the server is not in the expected JSON format. It looks like the response starts with a '<' character, which is not valid JSON.

One possible reason for this error is that the server is returning an HTML error page instead of the expected JSON response. To confirm this, you can try accessing the API endpoint directly in the browser and see if it returns a JSON response or an error page.

If the server is indeed returning an error page, you need to fix the server-side code to return the expected JSON response. If you are not sure how to do this, you can consult the documentation or seek help from a more experienced developer.

If the server is returning a valid JSON response, you may need to adjust the client-side code to handle the response correctly. You can try using a different method to deserialize the JSON response, or check if there are any errors in the deserialization process.
