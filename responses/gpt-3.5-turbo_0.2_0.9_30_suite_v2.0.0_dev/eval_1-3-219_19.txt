Here are a few things you can try to solve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Python extension installed in VS Code. You can check for updates by going to the Extensions tab on the left-hand side of the VS Code window and searching for "Python". If an update is available, click on the "Update" button.

2. Check that the correct Python interpreter is selected in VS Code. You can do this by clicking on the bottom left-hand corner of the VS Code window where it says "Python 3.x.x" and selecting the correct interpreter from the list.

3. Try running Jupyter notebook from the command line to see if it works outside of VS Code. Open a terminal window and activate your virtual environment by running `conda activate da38`. Then run the command `jupyter notebook` and see if it launches successfully.

4. If none of the above solutions work, try uninstalling and reinstalling both VS Code and Miniconda. Make sure to completely remove all files and folders associated with both programs before reinstalling.

Hopefully one of these solutions will help you get Jupyter notebook working in VS Code again.
