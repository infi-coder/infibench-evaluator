The error message you are seeing indicates that there is a problem with the interpreter for the `npm` command. This is likely due to a line ending issue in the `npm` script.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the `npm` script in a text editor using the command `sudo nano /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm`.
2. Look for the first line of the file, which should start with `#!/bin/sh`.
3. If there are any extra characters at the end of this line, such as `^M`, remove them.
4. Save the file and exit the text editor.
5. Try running the `npm -v` command again.

If this does not work, you can try reinstalling `npm` using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

This should install the latest version of `npm` and set up the necessary dependencies.
