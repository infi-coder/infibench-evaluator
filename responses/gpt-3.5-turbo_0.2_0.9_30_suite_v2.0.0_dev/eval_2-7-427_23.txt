For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server's clock is not synchronized with the client's clock, causing the token to expire before it should. Another possibility is that the session is being regenerated too frequently, causing the token to change unexpectedly. You can try increasing the SESSION_LIFETIME value to see if that helps.

For the second issue, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used is incorrect. You can try changing the encryption method to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' in your .env file and see if that resolves the issue. Additionally, you can try changing the port to 465, which is the default port for SMTP over SSL. If that doesn't work, you may need to contact the email provider to confirm the correct settings for connecting to their SMTP server.
