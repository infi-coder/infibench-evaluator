As of now, Enzyme does not have an official adapter for React 17. However, you can use the adapter for React 16 with React 17 without any issues. 

Here is the updated code snippet with the adapter for React 16:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Note that we are using the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package instead of the `enzyme-adapter-react-16` package. This adapter is a community-maintained adapter that works with React 17.

With this adapter, you can write unit tests for your React 17 app using Enzyme.
