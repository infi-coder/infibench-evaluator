The error you are encountering may be due to a compatibility issue between the Selenium VBA library and Excel 2019. Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium VBA library installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Check that the reference to the Selenium library is correctly set in your VBA project. To do this, go to the VBA editor, click on "Tools" > "References" and make sure that the "Selenium Type Library" is checked.

3. Try running the code in a different browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, to see if the issue is specific to Internet Explorer.

4. Check that Internet Explorer is up to date and that all necessary updates have been installed.

5. Try running the code on a different machine with Excel 2019 to see if the issue is specific to your machine.

6. If none of the above solutions work, you may need to contact the Selenium VBA support team for further assistance.
