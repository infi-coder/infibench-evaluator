This error occurs because pdftk is a 32-bit application and Catalina only supports 64-bit applications. Here are two possible solutions:

1. Use an alternative to pdftk: There are several alternatives to pdftk that are compatible with Catalina, such as PDFsam Basic, PDFtk Server, and QPDF. You can try one of these alternatives instead of pdftk.

2. Use a virtual machine: You can use a virtual machine to run an older version of MacOS that supports 32-bit applications. This will allow you to use pdftk on your Mac. You can use software like VirtualBox or Parallels to create a virtual machine. However, this solution requires more technical knowledge and may not be suitable for everyone.

I hope this helps!
