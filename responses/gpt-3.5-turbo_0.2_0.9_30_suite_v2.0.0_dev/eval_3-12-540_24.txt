Yes, in Flutter you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw a vertical line between components. The `VerticalDivider` widget is a simple widget that draws a vertical line with a specified width, height, and color. 

Here's an example of how to use the `VerticalDivider` widget:

```
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Text('Component 1'),
    VerticalDivider(),
    Text('Component 2'),
  ],
)
```

This will create a row with two text components separated by a vertical line. You can customize the width and color of the line by passing parameters to the `VerticalDivider` widget.
