Yes, there is a way to calculate the total number of days in a year given a datetime format of YYYY-MM-DD in Pandas. You can use the `date_range` function from Pandas to create a range of dates for the entire year and then count the number of days in that range.

Here's the function `DaysInYear` that takes year as integer arguments and returns day numbers of the year in integer:

```python
import pandas as pd

def DaysInYear(year):
    start_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-01-01')
    end_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-12-31')
    days_in_year = (end_date - start_date).days + 1
    return days_in_year
```

This function first creates a start date and end date for the given year using the `to_datetime` function from Pandas. It then calculates the number of days between these two dates using the `days` attribute of the resulting `Timedelta` object. Finally, it adds 1 to this value to include the end date in the count.

You can call this function with a year as an argument to get the number of days in that year. For example:

```python
print(DaysInYear(2020)) # Output: 366
print(DaysInYear(2019)) # Output: 365
```
