The error message "419 Page Expired" usually occurs when the CSRF token expires. The CSRF token is a security feature in Laravel that helps prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. 

To avoid this error message, you can try the following solutions:

1. Increase the session lifetime: By default, the session lifetime in Laravel is set to 120 minutes. You can increase this value in the `config/session.php` file. Set the `lifetime` value to a higher value, such as 1440 (24 hours).

2. Use AJAX for logout: Instead of using a regular form submission for logout, you can use AJAX to send a POST request to the logout route. This way, the CSRF token will be refreshed automatically, and you won't get the "419 Page Expired" error. Here's an example:

   ```
   <a href="#" onclick="event.preventDefault(); document.getElementById('logout-form').submit();">
       Logout
   </a>
   <form id="logout-form" action="{{ route('logout') }}" method="POST" style="display: none;">
       @csrf
   </form>
   ```

   In this example, the logout link triggers a JavaScript function that submits the logout form using AJAX. The `@csrf` directive generates a hidden input field with the CSRF token.

3. Use a package: There are several Laravel packages available that can help you handle expired CSRF tokens. For example, the `laravel-csrf` package provides a middleware that automatically refreshes the CSRF token if it has expired. You can install this package using Composer:

   ```
   composer require spatie/laravel-csrf
   ```

   Then, add the middleware to your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file:

   ```
   protected $middlewareGroups = [
       'web' => [
           // ...
           \Spatie\CsrfToken\VerifyCsrfToken::class,
       ],
   ];
   ```

   This middleware will automatically refresh the CSRF token if it has expired, so you won't get the "419 Page Expired" error.
