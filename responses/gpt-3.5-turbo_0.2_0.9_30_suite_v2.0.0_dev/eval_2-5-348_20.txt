The error message suggests that there is an issue with the path to the `mvn.cmd` file. Specifically, it seems that the path contains embedded quotes that are causing the command to fail.

To fix this issue, you can try enclosing the path in double quotes and escaping any existing double quotes within the path. For example:

```
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "\"\"\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd\"\" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path=\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar\" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install\""
```

This should properly escape the quotes in the path and allow the command to run without errors.
