For the first issue with the "CSRF token mismatch" error, it seems like the issue is with the session configuration on the host domain. One possible reason for multiple sessions being generated for one user could be due to the load balancer or proxy server being used by the host domain. In such cases, the requests from the same user may be routed to different servers, resulting in multiple sessions being created. To resolve this, you can try using a centralized session store like Redis or Memcached, which can be accessed by all servers in the cluster.

Regarding the second issue with the email, the error message suggests that there is a problem with the SSL certificate. It could be that the SSL certificate used by the mail server is outdated or not compatible with the version of OpenSSL being used by your server. You can try changing the encryption method to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' and see if that works. If not, you may need to contact the email provider and ask them to update their SSL certificate or provide you with a compatible one.
