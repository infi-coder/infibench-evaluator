Yes, the above comment is true/correct. 

In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's state and set up any necessary resources. 

Unlike regular methods, constructors cannot be called explicitly like a function. They are invoked automatically when a new object is created using the `new` keyword. 

Therefore, it is correct to say that a constructor cannot be called, as it is not a regular function that can be invoked by name.
