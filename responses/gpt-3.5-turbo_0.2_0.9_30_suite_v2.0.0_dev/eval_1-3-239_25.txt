Here's a bash script that you can use to install Python 3.6.5 using `brew`:

```
#!/bin/bash
brew update
brew install python@3.6
```

Save this script to a file, for example `install_python.sh`, and then run it in your terminal using the command `bash install_python.sh`. This will update `brew` and install Python 3.6.5 for you.
