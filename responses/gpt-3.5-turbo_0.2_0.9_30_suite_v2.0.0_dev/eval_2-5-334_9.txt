@Configuration should be used when you want to define beans using Java-based configuration instead of XML-based configuration. It is typically used to define beans that require more complex initialization or dependencies. @Service, @Controller, and @Component are used to mark classes as Spring-managed components, but they do not provide the same level of flexibility as @Configuration.
