This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, which is a language server for Rust. It is a false positive and does not indicate any issues with your code. You can safely ignore this error for now, or try updating rust-analyzer to see if the issue has been fixed. 

To update rust-analyzer, you can run the following command:
```
rustup update
```
This will update all the Rust tools, including rust-analyzer. If the error persists, you can try disabling rust-analyzer or using a different IDE or text editor.
