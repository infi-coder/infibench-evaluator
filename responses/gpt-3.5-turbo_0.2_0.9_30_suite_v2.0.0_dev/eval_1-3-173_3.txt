Yes, you can use the `date_range` function in Pandas to create a range of dates for the given year and then calculate the length of the range to get the total number of days in the year.

Here's the code for the `DaysInYear` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def DaysInYear(year):
    start_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-01-01')
    end_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-12-31')
    days_in_year = len(pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date))
    return days_in_year
```

This function takes the year as an argument, creates a start date and an end date for the year using the `to_datetime` function, creates a range of dates using `date_range`, and then calculates the length of the range to get the total number of days in the year.

You can call this function with a year as an argument to get the total number of days in that year:

```python
print(DaysInYear(2020)) # Output: 366
print(DaysInYear(2019)) # Output: 365
```
