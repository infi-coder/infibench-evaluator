You can use the `pip` module in Python to check the latest version of a package and compare it with the installed version. Here's the `checkVersion` function that takes the package name as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the package is up-to-date or not:

```python
import pip

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the latest version of the package from PyPI
    latest_version = str(pip.get_installed_distributions()[0]).split(' ')[1]
    # Get the installed version of the package
    installed_version = str(pip.get_installed_distributions(local_only=True)[0]).split(' ')[1]
    # Compare the two versions
    if latest_version == installed_version:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

You can call this function with the package name as an argument and it will return `True` if the package is up-to-date and `False` if it is not. For example:

```python
print(checkVersion('gekko'))
```

This will print `True` if the `gekko` package is up-to-date and `False` if it is not.
