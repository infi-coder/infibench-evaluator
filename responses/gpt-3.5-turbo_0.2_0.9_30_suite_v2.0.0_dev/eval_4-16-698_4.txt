You can use the following command to restart your current terminal session without closing the window on MacOS:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This will reload your updated `.bash_profile` file and apply any changes you made to it. You can also use the shorter version of the command:

```
. ~/.bash_profile
```

Both of these commands will restart your terminal session and apply any changes you made to your `.bash_profile` file without closing the window.
