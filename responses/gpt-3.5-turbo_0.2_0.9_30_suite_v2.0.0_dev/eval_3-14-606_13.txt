Developer mode is not a feature that can be enabled on iOS 16.0. It is possible that the alert you received is related to the provisioning profile used to sign the app. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the provisioning profile used to sign the app is still valid. If it has expired, you will need to generate a new one.

2. Make sure that the device you are using to test the app is registered as a development device in your Apple Developer account.

3. Check if the app is built with the correct provisioning profile and certificate.

4. If none of the above steps work, try restarting your device and rebuilding the app.

If the issue persists, you may need to contact the developer of the app for further assistance.
