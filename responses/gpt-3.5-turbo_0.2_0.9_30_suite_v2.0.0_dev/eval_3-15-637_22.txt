The issue might be related to the compatibility of the Selenium WebDriver with Excel 2019. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium WebDriver installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Check if the reference to the Selenium type library is properly set. To do this, go to the VBA editor and click on Tools > References. Look for the Selenium type library and make sure it is checked.

3. Try using a different browser driver. For example, instead of using the IE driver, try using the Chrome driver. You can download the Chrome driver from the official Selenium website.

4. Try running the code in compatibility mode. To do this, go to the Excel 2019 installation folder, right-click on the Excel.exe file, and select Properties. In the Compatibility tab, check the box for "Run this program in compatibility mode for" and select Excel 2013 from the drop-down menu.

5. If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling Excel 2019 and the Selenium WebDriver.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
