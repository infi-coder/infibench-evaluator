This error occurs when the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` method returns null. This can happen if the path_provider package is not properly initialized or if there is an issue with the platform-specific implementation of the package.

To fix this, make sure that you have added the path_provider package to your `pubspec.yaml` file and that you have run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

If you have already done this, try running `flutter clean` and then `flutter pub get` to clear any cached dependencies and rebuild the project.

If the issue persists, try running the app on a physical device or emulator, as the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` method may not work on some platforms (such as web).

If none of these solutions work, you can try using a different package for accessing the application documents directory, such as the `flutter_file_manager` package.
