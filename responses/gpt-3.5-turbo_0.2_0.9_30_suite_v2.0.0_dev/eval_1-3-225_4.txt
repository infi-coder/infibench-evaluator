Here's the revised code for the `pig_latin` function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
  words = text.split()
  pig_latin_words = []
  for word in words:
    endString = str(word[1:]).lower()
    startString = str(word[0]).lower()
    pig_latin_word = endString + startString + 'ay'
    pig_latin_words.append(pig_latin_word)
  return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)
```

The issue with the original code is that the `return` statement is inside the `for` loop, so it only runs once and returns the first word in pig Latin. Additionally, the logic for creating the pig Latin word was incorrect. The revised code splits the text into words, creates an empty list to store the pig Latin words, loops through each word, and creates a new pig Latin word by moving the first letter to the end and adding "ay". Finally, it joins all the pig Latin words back into a string separated by spaces and returns the result.
