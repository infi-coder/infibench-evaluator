The Rule of 5 is not outdated, as there are still cases where you may need to define these special member functions. 

For example, if your class manages a resource that cannot be handled by a smart pointer, such as a file handle or a network socket, then you will need to define a destructor to properly release that resource. Similarly, if your class has non-copyable or non-movable members, you will need to define the corresponding copy and move constructors and assignment operators.

While it is true that smart pointers can often be used to manage resources, they are not always the best solution. Smart pointers have some overhead and may not be appropriate for certain situations, such as when you need to manage a resource with a custom release function.

In summary, while the Rule of 5 may not apply to all classes, it is still an important guideline to follow when designing classes that manage resources or have non-copyable/non-movable members.
