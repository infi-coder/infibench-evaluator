The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is because the executable file was built on a Windows platform and cannot be executed on a Linux-based Lambda environment.

To resolve this issue, you need to build the executable file on a Linux-based environment or use a cross-compiler to build the executable file for the Linux platform.

Here are the steps to build the executable file on a Linux-based environment:

1. Install a Linux virtual machine or use a cloud-based Linux instance.
2. Copy the Go code to the Linux environment.
3. Build the executable file using the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to specify the target platform. For example, to build for Linux on an x86-64 architecture, use the following command:

   ```
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build main.go
   ```

4. Zip the executable file and any necessary dependencies.
5. Upload the zip file to AWS Lambda.

Alternatively, you can use a cross-compiler to build the executable file for the Linux platform on your Windows machine. One popular cross-compiler is `xgo`. Here are the steps to use `xgo`:

1. Install `xgo` by running the following command:

   ```
   go get github.com/karalabe/xgo
   ```

2. Build the executable file using `xgo` with the target platform specified. For example, to build for Linux on an x86-64 architecture, use the following command:

   ```
   xgo --targets=linux/amd64 main.go
   ```

3. Zip the executable file and any necessary dependencies.
4. Upload the zip file to AWS Lambda.

After following these steps, your Lambda function should be able to find and execute the `main` executable file without any issues.
