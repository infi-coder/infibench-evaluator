The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you will not have access to this attribute.

To use `[Keyless]`, you need to make sure that you have installed Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later. You can check the version of Entity Framework Core that you are using by looking at the version number of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package in your project's dependencies.

If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you can still create keyless entities by defining a class without a primary key and using the `HasNoKey` method in your `OnModelCreating` method to configure the entity as keyless. Here's an example:

```c#
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public int Property1 { get; set; }
    public string Property2 { get; set; }
}

public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<MyKeylessClass>().HasNoKey();
    }
}
```

This will allow you to use `FromSqlRaw` without having to add a primary key to your entity.
