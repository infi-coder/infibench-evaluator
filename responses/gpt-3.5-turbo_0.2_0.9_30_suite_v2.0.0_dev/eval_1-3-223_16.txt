You can use the `pip` module in Python to check if a package is at its latest version. Here's an implementation of the `checkVersion` function:

```python
import pip

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the package information
    package_info = pip.get_installed_distributions()
    
    # Check if the package is installed
    for package in package_info:
        if package.project_name == pkgName:
            # Check if the package is up-to-date
            latest_version = pip.get_latest_version(pkgName)
            if package.version == latest_version:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    
    # Package is not installed
    return False
```

This function first gets the list of installed packages using `pip.get_installed_distributions()`. It then checks if the specified package is installed by comparing the `project_name` attribute of each package to the `pkgName` argument. If the package is installed, it checks if it is up-to-date by comparing the installed version to the latest version using `pip.get_latest_version()`. If the package is not installed, the function returns `False`.

You can call this function like this:

```python
is_latest_version = checkVersion('gekko')
print(is_latest_version)
```

This will print `True` if the `gekko` package is installed and up-to-date, and `False` otherwise.
