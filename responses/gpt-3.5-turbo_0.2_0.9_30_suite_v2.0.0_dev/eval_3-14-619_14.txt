The issue might be that the `ContentView` is not being updated when the `isSelected` property changes. You can try wrapping the `Text` view in a `VStack` and adding a `Spacer` to force the view to update:

```
var body: some View {
    VStack {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
        Spacer()
    }
}
``` 

Alternatively, you can try using `@State` instead of `@Binding` for the `isSelected` property in the `ContentView` struct.
