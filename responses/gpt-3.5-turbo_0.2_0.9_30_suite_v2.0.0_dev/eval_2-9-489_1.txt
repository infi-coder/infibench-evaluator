This warning is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled, which could potentially make your cluster accessible to anyone. To fix this, you can enable Elasticsearch security by following these steps:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file located at `config/elasticsearch.yml`.
2. Add the following lines to the file:

```
xpack.security.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After enabling security, you may need to update your Searchkick configuration to include authentication credentials. You can do this by adding the following lines to your `config/initializers/searchkick.rb` file:

```
Searchkick.client_options = {
  user: "your_username",
  password: "your_password"
}
```

Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your Elasticsearch authentication credentials.

Note: If you don't have authentication credentials set up yet, you can follow the instructions in the Elasticsearch documentation to set up a basic authentication user.
