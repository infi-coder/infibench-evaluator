There are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Make sure that the Spring Boot application is running and accessible at `localhost:8080`. If the application is not running, you won't be able to access the Swagger UI.

2. Check if the `springdoc-openapi-ui` dependency is correctly added to your project. You can verify this by checking the `External Libraries` section of your project in your IDE.

3. Check if the `@EnableSwagger2WebMvc` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application. This annotation is required to enable Swagger UI in your application.

4. Check if the `@ComponentScan` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application. This annotation is required to scan the packages containing the Swagger UI components.

5. Check if the `@OpenAPIDefinition` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application. This annotation is required to define the OpenAPI specification for your application.

6. Check if the `@SwaggerDefinition` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application. This annotation is required to define the Swagger definition for your application.

If all of the above steps are correct, then you should be able to access the Swagger UI at `localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.
