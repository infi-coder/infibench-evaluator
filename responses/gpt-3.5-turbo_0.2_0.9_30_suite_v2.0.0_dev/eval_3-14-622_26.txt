To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to define a `fill` method that takes a `ContentShape` and a `View` as parameters. Here's an example implementation for your `RedView`:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(Color.red)
    }
}
```

This implementation creates a `Circle` shape and fills it with the color red. You can now use `RedView` as a `fill` parameter for any `Shape` in SwiftUI.
