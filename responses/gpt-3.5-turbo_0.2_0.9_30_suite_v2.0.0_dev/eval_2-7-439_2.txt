The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server separately.

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you can follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -m | grep zip
   ```

   If the extension is already installed, you should see `zip` in the list of installed modules.

2. If the extension is not installed, you can install it using your server's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install php-zip
   ```

   On CentOS, you can run:

   ```
   sudo yum install php-zip
   ```

3. Once the extension is installed, restart your web server to apply the changes.

After installing the `ext-zip` extension, you should be able to use it in your PHP code without any issues.
