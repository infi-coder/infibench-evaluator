Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r'[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function first checks if the input string is empty, in which case it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it splits the string into words using the regular expression `r'[-_]'`, which matches either a dash or an underscore. It then capitalizes the first letter of each word except the first word, and concatenates them together to form the camel case string.

Here's how you can test the function with the given test cases:

```python
def test_to_camel_case():
    assert to_camel_case('') == ''
    assert to_camel_case('the_stealth_warrior') == 'theStealthWarrior'
    assert to_camel_case('The-Stealth-Warrior') == 'TheStealthWarrior'
    assert to_camel_case('A-B-C') == 'ABC'
    print('All test cases pass')

test_to_camel_case()
```
