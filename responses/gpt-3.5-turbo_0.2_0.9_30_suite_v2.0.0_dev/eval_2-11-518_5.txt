The Rule of 5 is not outdated, as there are still cases where a user-defined constructor, destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment constructor, move constructor, or move assignment constructor is necessary. 

For example, if a class manages a resource that cannot be handled by a smart pointer, such as a file handle or a network socket, then a user-defined destructor is necessary to properly release the resource. Similarly, if a class has non-copyable or non-movable members, then a user-defined copy constructor, copy assignment constructor, move constructor, or move assignment constructor may be necessary.

While it is true that smart pointers can be used to manage resources, they are not always the best solution. Smart pointers have overhead and can introduce complexity, especially in multi-threaded environments. In addition, using smart pointers may not be possible or desirable in certain situations, such as when interfacing with legacy code or when working with low-level system resources.

In summary, while smart pointers can be a useful tool for managing resources, they are not always the best solution and there are still cases where a user-defined constructor, destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment constructor, move constructor, or move assignment constructor is necessary.
