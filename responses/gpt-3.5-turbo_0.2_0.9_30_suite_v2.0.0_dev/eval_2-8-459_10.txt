It seems like the go module system is unable to download the required dependency from the private repository. Here are a few things you can try to debug this issue:

1. Check if the private repository is accessible from computer B: Make sure that you can access the private repository from computer B. You can try cloning the repository manually and see if it works.

2. Check if the credentials are set up correctly: Make sure that the credentials for accessing the private repository are set up correctly on computer B. You can check the `~/.gitconfig` file to see if the credentials are set up correctly.

3. Check if the module cache is corrupted: Try clearing the module cache on computer B and then try building the program again. You can clear the module cache by running the following command:

   ```bash
   $ go clean -modcache
   ```

4. Check if the module version is correct: Make sure that the version of the dependency specified in the `go.mod` file is correct. You can try updating the version to the latest version and see if it works.

5. Check if the module proxy is set up correctly: Make sure that the module proxy is set up correctly on computer B. You can check the `GOPROXY` environment variable to see if it is set up correctly.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you debug the issue and get the program to build successfully.
