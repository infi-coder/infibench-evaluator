With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for using icons has changed. Here's how you can modify your code to use Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

In Font Awesome 5, the font family name has changed to "Font Awesome 5 Free". Additionally, you need to specify the font weight as 900 to ensure that the icon is displayed correctly.
