Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the following command:

```
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you to enter your current passphrase for the key and then allow you to enter a new passphrase if desired. After that, your id_rsa file will be converted to an RSA private key with the header you expect.

As for your second question, you do not need to transfer your id_rsa.pub file as it is simply the public key that corresponds to your private key. The conversion process will not affect your public key.
