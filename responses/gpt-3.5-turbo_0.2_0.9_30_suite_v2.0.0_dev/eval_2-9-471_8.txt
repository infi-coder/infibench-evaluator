To import images in a React component with TypeScript, you need to do the following:

1. Create a `.d.ts` file with the same name as the image file, e.g., `image.jpg.d.ts`.
2. Inside the `.d.ts` file, declare a module with the same name as the image file, e.g., `declare module '*.jpg';`.
3. In your component file, import the image using the `require` syntax, e.g., `const img = require('../assets/image.jpg');`.

Here's an example of how your files should look like:

```
+ src
  + assets
    - image.jpg
  + components
    - Box.tsx
    - App.tsx
  - index.html
  - index.tsx
- tsconfig.json
- tslint.json
```

`image.jpg.d.ts`:

```
declare module '*.jpg';
```

`App.tsx`:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
const img = require('../assets/image.jpg');

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```

Note that you don't need to include the `.d.ts` file in `tsconfig.json`. TypeScript will automatically pick it up. Also, make sure that the `.d.ts` file is not named `index.d.ts`, as TypeScript will ignore it.
