For the first question, the issue could be related to the session driver configuration on the host domain. Make sure that the session driver is set to the same value as the one used locally. Also, check if there are any differences in the PHP configurations between the local and host environments.

For the second question, the error message suggests that there is an issue with the SSL certificate. Try changing the encryption method to `tls` instead of `ssl`. Also, make sure that the `MAIL_PORT` is set to the correct value for the SMTP server. If the issue persists, contact the email provider to check if there are any specific configurations required for their SMTP server.
