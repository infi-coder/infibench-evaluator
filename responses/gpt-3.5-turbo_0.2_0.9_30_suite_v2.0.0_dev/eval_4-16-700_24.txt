You can use awk to achieve this task more efficiently. Here's an example:

```
awk -F= '/name/ {name=$2} /value/ && name {print name "=" $2; name=""}' input.txt > output.txt
```

This command sets the field separator to "=" and then looks for lines containing "name" or "value". If the line contains "name", it saves the name in a variable. If the line contains "value" and the name variable is not empty, it prints the name and value separated by "=" to the output file. This way, it avoids printing lines where the name is followed by another name.
