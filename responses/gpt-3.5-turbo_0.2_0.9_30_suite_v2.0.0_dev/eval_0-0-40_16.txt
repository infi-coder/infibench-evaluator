The error message you are seeing indicates that there is an issue with the line endings in the `npm` script. This is likely because the script was created on a Windows machine and then copied over to your WSL2 environment.

To fix this issue, you can try running the following command to convert the line endings of the `npm` script to Unix format:

```
sudo apt-get install dos2unix
sudo dos2unix /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm
```

This should convert the line endings of the `npm` script to Unix format and allow you to run the `npm` command without any issues.
