You can try using the `tz_localize` method to set the timezone to UTC and then use the `tz_convert` method to convert it to a timezone-naive datetime. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
df['time'] = df['time'].dt.tz_localize(None).dt.tz_convert('UTC').dt.tz_localize(None)
```

This will remove the timezone information from the "time" column and convert it to a timezone-naive datetime. You can then pass this modified DataFrame to the `to_excel` method.

Here's the complete `removeTimezone` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def removeTimezone(df):
    df['time'] = df['time'].dt.tz_localize(None).dt.tz_convert('UTC').dt.tz_localize(None)
    return df
```

You can call this function with your DataFrame as the argument and it will return the modified DataFrame with the timezone information removed from the "time" column.
