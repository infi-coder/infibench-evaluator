You can add your existing SSH key to Git Bash by following these steps:

1. Open Git Bash and navigate to your home directory by typing `cd ~` and pressing Enter.
2. Create a new directory called `.ssh` by typing `mkdir .ssh` and pressing Enter.
3. Copy your SSH key file (e.g. `id_rsa`) from `D:/keys` to the `.ssh` directory you just created.
4. Change the permissions of the SSH key file by typing `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa` and pressing Enter.
5. Add the SSH key to your SSH agent by typing `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa` and pressing Enter.

That's it! Your existing SSH key should now be added to Git Bash and ready to use.
