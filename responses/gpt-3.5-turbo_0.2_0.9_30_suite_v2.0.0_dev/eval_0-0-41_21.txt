The code you provided looks correct. However, if the location is not available, the `else` block will not be executed. Instead, an error callback function can be added as the second argument of the `getCurrentPosition` method to handle errors. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => {
        console.log("Location accessed");
    }, error => {
        console.log("User not allowed");
    });
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this revised code, if the location is not available, the error callback function will be executed and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console.
