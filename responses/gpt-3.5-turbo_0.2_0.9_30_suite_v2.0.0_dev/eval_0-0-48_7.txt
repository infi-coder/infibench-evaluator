Sure! The code you provided is almost correct, but you need to use the `|` operator instead of the `,` operator to combine the two index signatures. Here's the corrected code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} | {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This defines a type `FruitsAndColors` that has either a numeric property for each `fruit` or a boolean property for each `color`.
