The issue might be that the `ContentView` is not being updated when the `isSelected` variable changes. Try wrapping the `Text` view in a `VStack` and adding a `Spacer` to force the view to update:

```
var body: some View {
    VStack {
        Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        Spacer()
    }
}
```
