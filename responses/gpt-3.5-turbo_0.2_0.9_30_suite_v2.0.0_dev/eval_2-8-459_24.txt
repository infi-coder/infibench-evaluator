It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is present in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is present in the cache, you should see output similar to the following:

   ```
   github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is not present in the cache, you will see an error message.

2. Check if the module is accessible from computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m -versions github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
   ```

   This command will list all the available versions of the module. If the module is not accessible, you will see an error message.

3. Check if the module is using the correct version. You can do this by checking the `go.mod` file in your project directory. Make sure that the version of the module specified in the `go.mod` file matches the version you are trying to use.

4. Try running `go clean -modcache` on computer B to clear the module cache and then run `go build` again.

5. If none of the above steps work, try running `go env` on both computers to compare the environment variables and settings. This may help you identify any differences that could be causing the issue.

I hope this helps you debug the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions.
