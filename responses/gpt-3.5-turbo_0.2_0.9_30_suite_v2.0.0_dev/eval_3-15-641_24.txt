You can use the Windows API to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. Here's some sample code:

```
Private Declare Function SHGetKnownFolderPath Lib "shell32.dll" (ByRef rfid As Any, ByVal dwFlags As Long, ByVal hToken As Long, ByRef pszPath As Any) As Long

Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrive = "{A52BBA46-E9E1-435f-B3D9-28DAA648C0F6}"
Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro = "{7C9D8867-D853-4E60-841E-AB360140D6F4}"

Sub GetOneDrivePath()
    Dim path As String
    Dim rfid As Variant
    
    If IsOffice365() Then
        rfid = FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro
    Else
        rfid = FOLDERID_SkyDrive
    End If
    
    If SHGetKnownFolderPath(rfid, 0, 0, path) = 0 Then
        MsgBox path
    Else
        MsgBox "Unable to get OneDrive path"
    End If
End Sub

Function IsOffice365() As Boolean
    IsOffice365 = InStr(Application.Version, "16") = 1
End Function
```

This code uses the `SHGetKnownFolderPath` function to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. The `IsOffice365` function checks if the user is using Office 365, which determines whether to use the OneDrive or OneDrive for Business folder ID. You can modify this code to search for the "2021 Tenders" folder and return its path.
