To write a list of lists into an Excel file, we can use the `openpyxl` library in Python. Here's the `writeToExcel` function that creates an Excel file named "data.xlsx" and writes the contents of the `new_list` variable into the file:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeToExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
    sheet = wb.active
    for row in new_list:
        sheet.append(row)
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

In this function, we first import the `openpyxl` library. Then we create a new list of lists called `new_list`. We create a new Excel workbook using the `openpyxl.Workbook()` method and assign it to the `wb` variable. We get the active worksheet using the `wb.active` attribute and assign it to the `sheet` variable.

Next, we loop through each row in `new_list` and append it to the worksheet using the `sheet.append()` method. Finally, we save the workbook using the `wb.save()` method and pass in the filename "data.xlsx".
