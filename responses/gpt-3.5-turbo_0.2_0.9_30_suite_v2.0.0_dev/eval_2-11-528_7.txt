You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and keep them in the order they are written in your code. 

If you don't have a `.clang-format` file yet, you can create one in the root directory of your project and add the above line to it. 

Note that disabling the sorting of includes may cause issues with some third-party libraries that require a specific include order. In that case, it's best to follow the recommended include order for those libraries and manually adjust the order of your includes accordingly.
