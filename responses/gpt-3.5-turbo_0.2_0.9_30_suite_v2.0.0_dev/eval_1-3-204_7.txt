The issue with your code is that the `rename()` method is not applicable to a Pandas Series object, which is what you get when you call `.mean()` on a DataFrame column. Instead, you can use the `agg()` method to apply multiple aggregation functions to a DataFrame column and then rename the resulting columns.

Here's the modified code that should work:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
    avg = df.groupby("t", sort=False)["p"].agg(mean=("p", "mean")).reset_index()
    avg = avg.rename(columns={"mean": "p"})
    return avg
```

In this code, we first group the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column using the `agg()` method. The `agg()` method takes a dictionary where the keys are the new column names and the values are tuples of the original column name and the aggregation function to apply. We then reset the index of the resulting DataFrame to make the "t" column a regular column. Finally, we rename the "mean" column to "p" using the `rename()` method.

You can call this function by passing your DataFrame as an argument:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
renamed_df = renameDataFrame(df)
```

This should return a DataFrame with the "p" column renamed as "mean" and the average numbers grouped by the "t" column.
