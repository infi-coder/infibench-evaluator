In TailwindCSS, you can use the `>` (direct child) selector by using the `@layer` directive to add custom styles to the `utilities` layer. Here's an example:

```css
@layer utilities {
  .section > .child {
    /* Your styles here */
  }
}
```

In this example, `.section > .child` targets the direct children of elements with the class `section`. You can replace `.child` with any selector you want to target the specific children you need.

Make sure to include this code in a CSS file that is included in your project.
