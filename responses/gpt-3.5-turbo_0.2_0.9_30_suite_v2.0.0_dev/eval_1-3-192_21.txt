Here's the Python code for the `to_camel_case` function that satisfies the requirements:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split('[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join([word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]])
```

This function first checks if the input string is empty, and returns an empty string if it is. Then, it splits the input string into words using the `re.split()` function, which splits the string on either a dash or an underscore. The first word is added to the result string as is, while the remaining words are capitalized and concatenated to the result string. Finally, the result string is returned.
