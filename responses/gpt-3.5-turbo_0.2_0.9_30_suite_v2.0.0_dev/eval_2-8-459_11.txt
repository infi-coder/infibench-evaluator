It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is present in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
```
If the module is not present in the cache, then it means that it is not being downloaded.

2. Check if the module is accessible from computer B. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
go list -m -versions github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
```
This command will list all the available versions of the module. If the module is not accessible, then it means that there might be some network issues or authentication issues.

3. Check if the module is using the correct version. You can do this by checking the `go.mod` file in your project and verifying that the correct version of the module is specified.

4. Try running `go clean -modcache` on computer B to clear the module cache and force a fresh download of all the modules.

5. If none of the above steps work, try running `go env` on both computers and compare the output. This might help you identify any differences in the environment that might be causing the issue.

I hope these steps help you debug the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions.
