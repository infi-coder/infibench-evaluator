To mock a class with Jest, you need to return a constructor function that creates an instance of the class. Here's the revised code that should eliminate the error:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {
      someMethod: jest.fn()
    };
  });
});

const api = new API();
```

In this code, we're returning a Jest mock function that returns an object with a `someMethod` property. The `jest.fn()` function creates a mock function that we can use to spy on method calls. The `mockImplementation()` function sets up the implementation of the mock constructor function. In this case, it returns an object with a `someMethod` property that is also a Jest mock function. 

By using this code, you should be able to mock the `API` class and create an instance of it without encountering the `TypeError`.
