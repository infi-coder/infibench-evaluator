This error occurs because IntelliJ IDEA is using an older version of Maven than the one used to generate the project. To fix this issue, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Maven settings in IntelliJ IDEA by going to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.
2. Click on the "Maven home directory" field and select the directory where your Maven 3.8.5 installation is located.
3. Click "OK" to save the changes.
4. Re-import the Maven project by going to File > New > Project from Existing Sources and selecting the pom.xml file of your project.

This should resolve the issue and allow you to work with the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
