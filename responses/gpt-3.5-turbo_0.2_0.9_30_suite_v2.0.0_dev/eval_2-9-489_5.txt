This warning is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled. Without authentication, your cluster could be accessible to anyone. 

To fix this, you can enable Elasticsearch security by following the instructions in the link provided in the warning message: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html.

Alternatively, you can disable Elasticsearch security by adding the following line to your `config/initializers/searchkick.rb` file:

```
Searchkick.disable_callbacks = true
```

This will disable Elasticsearch security warnings and callbacks. However, it's not recommended to disable security features in Elasticsearch.
