The issue you are facing could be due to the incompatibility of the Selenium WebDriver version with the Excel 2019 version. Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium WebDriver installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Try using a different browser driver. For example, if you are using the Internet Explorer driver, try using the Chrome or Firefox driver instead.

3. Check if the reference to the Selenium type library is properly set. To do this, go to the VBA editor, click on Tools > References, and make sure that the reference to the Selenium type library is checked.

4. Try running the code in compatibility mode. To do this, right-click on the Excel icon, select Properties, go to the Compatibility tab, and select the option to run the program in compatibility mode for an earlier version of Windows.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try uninstalling and reinstalling Excel 2019 and the Selenium WebDriver.

I hope one of these solutions works for you.
