The `FormatException` is thrown when the JSON string is not properly formatted. In your case, it seems that the response from the server is not in a valid JSON format.

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the response from the server using a tool like Postman or Insomnia to make sure that it is a valid JSON format.

2. If the response is not in a valid JSON format, you need to fix the server-side code to return a valid JSON format.

3. If the response is in a valid JSON format, you can try to print the response body to see what it contains. Sometimes, the response may contain unexpected characters like whitespace or newline characters that can cause the `FormatException`.

4. If the response contains unexpected characters, you can try to remove them using the `trim()` method before decoding the JSON.

Here is an updated version of your code that includes error handling and logging:

```dart
Future<String> iniciarSesion() async {
  var usuario = textUsuario.text;
  var password = textPassword.text;
  var nombreUsuario;
  var url = "http://192.168.1.37/usuario.php";

  //Metodo post
  var response = await http.post(
    url,
    headers: {"Accept": "application/json"},
    body: {"usuario": '$usuario', "password": '$password'},
    encoding: Encoding.getByName("utf-8"),
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    try {
      List data = json.decode(response.body.trim());
      // Process the data here
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error decoding JSON: $e");
    }
  } else {
    print("Error getting response: ${response.statusCode}");
  }
}
``` 

This code checks the HTTP status code and logs any errors that occur during the decoding process.
