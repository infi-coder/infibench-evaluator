Yes, the above comment is true/correct. 

A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created. It is not called explicitly like a regular function. When a new object is created using the `new` keyword, the constructor is invoked automatically to initialize the object's properties and set its initial state. 

Therefore, it is not possible to call a constructor like a regular function. It is only invoked automatically when a new object is created.
