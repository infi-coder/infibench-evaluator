```c++
vector<pair<int, int>> origin_to_goal(vector<int> origin) {
    vector<pair<int, int>> goal;
    auto it = origin.begin();
    while (it != origin.end()) {
        goal.emplace_back(*it, *(it + 1));
        it += 2;
    }
    return goal;
}
```
This implementation uses the `emplace_back` function to construct the pairs directly in the vector, avoiding unnecessary copies. The `auto` keyword is used to deduce the type of the iterator, and the `while` loop iterates over the vector by incrementing the iterator by 2 at each step.
