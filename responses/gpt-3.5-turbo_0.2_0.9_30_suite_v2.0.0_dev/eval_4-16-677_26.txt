You need to remove the single quotes around `$searchT` in the `grep` command inside the `if` statement. Single quotes prevent variable expansion, so the `grep` command is looking for the literal string `$searchT` instead of the value of the variable. Here's the corrected code:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

With this change, the `grep` command will use the value of `$searchT` to search for matches in the `test.txt` file. If matches are found, the script will output the number of matches and the matching lines. If no matches are found, the script will output "no match found".
