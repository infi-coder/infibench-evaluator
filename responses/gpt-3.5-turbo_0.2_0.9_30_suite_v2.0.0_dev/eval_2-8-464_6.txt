The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is likely because the executable file was not properly included in the ZIP file that you uploaded to AWS Lambda.

Here are some steps you can follow to ensure that the executable file is included in the ZIP file:

1. Build the executable file for Linux platform by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build main.go
   ```

   This will create an executable file named `main` that is compatible with the Linux operating system.

2. Create a ZIP file that includes the `main` executable file by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   zip main.zip main
   ```

   This will create a ZIP file named `main.zip` that includes the `main` executable file.

3. Upload the `main.zip` file to AWS Lambda and set the handler to `main`.

   Make sure that you upload the `main.zip` file that you created in step 2 and set the handler to `main` (without the `.exe` extension).

4. Test the Lambda function with a sample event.

   Once you have uploaded the ZIP file and set the handler, you can test the Lambda function with a sample event to ensure that it is working properly.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
