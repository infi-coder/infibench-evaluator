The error message you are seeing indicates that there is an issue with the line endings in the `npm` file. This is a common issue when using files created in Windows on a Linux system.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the `npm` file in a text editor that supports Unix-style line endings (such as `nano` or `vim`).
2. Convert the line endings to Unix-style by running the following command in the text editor: `:set ff=unix` (in `vim`) or `Ctrl+O` then `Ctrl+X` (in `nano`).
3. Save the file and exit the text editor.
4. Try running the `npm -v` command again.

If the above steps do not work, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling `npm` using the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get remove npm
sudo apt-get install npm
```

This should install the latest version of `npm` and fix any issues with the installation.
