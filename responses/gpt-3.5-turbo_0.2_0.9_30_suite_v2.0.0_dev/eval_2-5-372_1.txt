It seems that you have a version conflict between the Hibernate Validator version that is included in your JBoss server and the version that is included in your Maven dependencies. 

The version of Hibernate Validator that is included in your JBoss server is `5.3.5.Final-redhat-2`, while the version that is included in your Maven dependencies is `6.0.11`. 

You can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from your Maven dependencies and let JBoss provide the implementation. To do this, add the following exclusion to your `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency:

```xml
<exclusion>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
</exclusion>
```

Alternatively, you can try to upgrade the version of Hibernate Validator in your JBoss server to match the version in your Maven dependencies.
