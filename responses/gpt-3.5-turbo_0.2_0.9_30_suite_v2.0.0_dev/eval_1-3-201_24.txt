You can use multiprocessing to run the two scripts simultaneously. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use multiprocessing:

```python
import multiprocessing as mp

def run_data_mining(database):
    dataMiningScript = fd.financeData(database, 1600)

def run_webpage(database):
    app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
    homepage = hp.homepage(database)
    homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
    homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()
    app.run_server(debug=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    database = db.dataBase()
    p1 = mp.Process(target=run_data_mining, args=(database,))
    p2 = mp.Process(target=run_webpage, args=(database,))
    p1.start()
    p2.start()
    p1.join()
    p2.join()
```

In this modified code, we define two functions `run_data_mining` and `run_webpage` that will be run in separate processes. We pass the `database` object to both functions as an argument.

We then create two `Process` objects `p1` and `p2` that will run the two functions respectively. We start both processes using the `start` method and wait for them to finish using the `join` method.

Note that you may need to modify the code inside the `run_data_mining` and `run_webpage` functions to properly handle the database connection and any other resources that need to be shared between the two processes.
