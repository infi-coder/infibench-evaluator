The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` indicates that the package you are trying to install (`aws-sdk-js`) is not found in the registry. This could be due to a temporary issue with the registry or a problem with your network connection.

You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check if you can access the package on the registry by visiting https://registry.npmjs.org/aws-sdk-js in your browser. If you see a JSON response, then the package exists in the registry.

2. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.

3. Try using a different registry by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/` and then running `npm install` again.

4. If none of the above steps work, try updating npm to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm@latest` and then running `npm install` again.
