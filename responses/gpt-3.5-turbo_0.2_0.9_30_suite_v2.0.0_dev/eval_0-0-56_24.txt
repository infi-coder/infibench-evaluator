It seems that the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost`, which means it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0`, which will make it available on all network interfaces.

To do this, you can modify the `server.host` option in your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  server: {
    port: 8080,
    host: '0.0.0.0'
  }
})
```

This will make the Vite server accessible from outside the container.

Also, make sure that the port `8080` is not already in use by another process on your host machine. You can check this by running `lsof -i :8080` on your host machine. If there is another process using this port, you can either stop that process or use a different port for your Vite server.
