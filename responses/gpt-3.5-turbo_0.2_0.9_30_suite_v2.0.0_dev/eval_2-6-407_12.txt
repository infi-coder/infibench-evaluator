The error message suggests that the response from the server is not in the expected JSON format. It seems like the response is starting with a '<' character, which is not valid JSON.

One possible reason for this error could be that the server is returning an HTML error page instead of the expected JSON response. To confirm this, you can try accessing the API endpoint directly in the browser and see if it returns a valid JSON response.

If the server is returning a valid JSON response, you can try changing the code to use the full URL instead of the relative URL. Replace the following line:

```
empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("/api/Employee/Index");
```

with:

```
empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("https://localhost:5001/api/Employee/Index");
```

Replace the URL with the actual URL of your API endpoint.

If the server is not returning a valid JSON response, you need to investigate the server-side code to ensure that it is returning the expected JSON response.
