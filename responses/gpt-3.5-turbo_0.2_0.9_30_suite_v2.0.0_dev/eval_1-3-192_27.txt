Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r'[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

Here, we first check if the input string is empty or not. If it is empty, we return an empty string. Otherwise, we split the string into words using the regular expression `r'[-_]'`, which matches either a dash or an underscore.

We then capitalize the first letter of each word except the first word, and join them together to form the camel case string. Finally, we return the camel case string.

Note that we use the `capitalize()` method to capitalize the first letter of each word, and not the `title()` method, because the latter would also capitalize the first letter of the first word, which we don't want to do if it was not capitalized in the original string.
