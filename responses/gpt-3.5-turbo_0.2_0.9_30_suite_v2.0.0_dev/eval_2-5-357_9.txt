Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly indicates that the class has a dependency on another class, and the dependency is injected through the constructor. It also ensures that the dependency is mandatory and must be provided at the time of object creation. Additionally, it allows for easier testing, as dependencies can be easily mocked or substituted in tests. However, if you prefer to use constructor injection without `@Autowired`, it is also a valid approach.
