The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` suggests that the package you are trying to install (`aws-sdk-js`) is not available in the npm registry. This could be due to a temporary issue with the registry or a typo in the package name.

You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check if the package name is correct. You can search for the package on the npm website to verify the name.

2. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.

3. If the issue persists, try switching to a different npm registry by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/` and then run `npm install` again.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try updating npm to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm@latest` and then run `npm install` again.
