This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, which is a language server for Rust that provides IDE-like features such as code completion and error highlighting. The error message is indicating that rust-analyzer is having trouble resolving the `format_args` macro, which is used internally by the `pad_str` function.

Fortunately, this error should not affect the functionality of your code, and it is safe to ignore it. If you want to get rid of the error message, you can try updating your Rust toolchain and/or rust-analyzer to the latest version, as this bug may have been fixed in a more recent release. Alternatively, you can try disabling the rust-analyzer extension in your editor and using the built-in Rust language server instead.
