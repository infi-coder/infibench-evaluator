Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the dependencies required and explicit. This means that the class cannot be instantiated without providing the required dependencies. It also makes the code more readable and easier to understand, as it clearly shows which dependencies are required by the class. Additionally, it helps to avoid circular dependencies, as Spring will throw an exception if it detects a circular dependency. However, if you prefer to use constructor injection without `@Autowired`, you can still do so.
