To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to do the following:

1. Update your project to use Android Studio 4.2 or later.
2. Add the following dependencies to your app-level build.gradle file:

```
android {
    ...
    buildFeatures {
        compose true
    }
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:1.0.0"
}
```

3. Sync your project with Gradle.
4. Start using Jetpack Compose in your project.

Note that you may need to update your project's code to use Jetpack Compose instead of the traditional Android UI toolkit.
