The reason why you are seeing the logs in that order is because the `onItemSelected` function is called asynchronously when the user selects an item from the spinner. This means that the function `Spinner.setupListWithAdapter` will continue to execute after setting the listener, and will immediately return the initial value of `itemSelected`, which is an empty string.

To fix this, you can use a callback function to return the selected item after it has been selected. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use a callback:

```
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>, callback: (String) -> Unit) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            Log.e("categoryLog","1 : " + itemSelected)
            callback(itemSelected)
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
}
```

In this modified code, the `Spinner.setupListWithAdapter` function takes a callback function as a parameter. This callback function takes a `String` parameter, which is the selected item from the spinner. Inside the `onItemSelected` function, you can call the callback function with the selected item, which will return the value to the caller.

To use this modified function, you can pass in a lambda function as the callback parameter. Here's an example:

```
spinner.setupListWithAdapter(listOf("Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3")) { selectedItem ->
    // Do something with the selected item
    Log.e("categoryLog", "Selected item: $selectedItem")
}
```

In this example, the lambda function logs the selected item to the console. You can replace this with your own code to handle the selected item as needed.
