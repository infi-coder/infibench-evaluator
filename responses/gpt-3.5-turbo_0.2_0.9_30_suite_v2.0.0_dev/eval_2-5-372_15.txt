It seems that there might be a conflict between the version of Hibernate Validator that is included in your project and the one that is included in JBoss. 

You can try excluding the Hibernate Validator dependency from your project and let JBoss use its own version. To do this, add the following exclusion to your `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency:

```xml
<exclusion>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
</exclusion>
```

This will exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from your project, and JBoss will use its own version.

Alternatively, you can try upgrading the version of Hibernate Validator in your project to match the one in JBoss. To do this, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.5.Final-redhat-2</version>
</dependency>
```

This will ensure that your project is using the same version of Hibernate Validator as JBoss.

After making these changes, try running your project again and see if the issue is resolved.
