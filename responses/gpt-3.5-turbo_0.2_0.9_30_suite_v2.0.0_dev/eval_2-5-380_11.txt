In order to use the Swagger UI with Spring Boot, you need to make sure that you have the following configurations in your application:

1. Make sure that you have the `@EnableSwagger2` annotation in your Spring Boot application class.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableSwagger2
public class SwaggerConfig {
    // ...
}
```

2. Make sure that you have the `@Configuration` annotation in your Swagger configuration class.

```java
@Configuration
public class SwaggerConfig {
    // ...
}
```

3. Make sure that you have the `@Bean` annotation for the `Docket` bean in your Swagger configuration class.

```java
@Configuration
public class SwaggerConfig {
    @Bean
    public Docket api() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

4. Make sure that you have the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` property set in your `application.properties` file.

```
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui.html
```

If you have all of these configurations set up correctly, then you should be able to access the Swagger UI at `localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.
