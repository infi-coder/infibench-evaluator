Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the following command in your terminal:

```
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you to enter your current passphrase for the key, and then it will ask you to enter a new passphrase (you can leave it blank if you don't want to set a new passphrase). After that, it will convert your key to the RSA format and save it as `id_rsa` in the PEM format.

As for your second question, you don't need to transfer your `id_rsa.pub` file as it is just the public key that corresponds to your private key. The server administrator only needs your public key to grant you access to the server.
