Here are a few things you can try to solve the issue:

1. Make sure that the Jupyter package is installed in your virtual environment. You can do this by activating your virtual environment and running the command `conda install jupyter`.

2. Check if the Jupyter kernel is installed in your virtual environment. You can do this by running the command `jupyter kernelspec list` in your terminal. If the kernel is not listed, you can install it by running the command `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=da38`.

3. Try launching Jupyter notebook outside of VS Code to see if it works. You can do this by activating your virtual environment and running the command `jupyter notebook`. If it works, then the issue may be with VS Code.

4. Try updating the Python extension in VS Code. You can do this by going to the Extensions tab, searching for the Python extension, and clicking on the Update button.

5. Try resetting the VS Code settings to their default values. You can do this by going to the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), searching for "Preferences: Open User Settings", clicking on the three dots in the top right corner, and selecting "Reset Settings".

Hopefully one of these solutions will help you resolve the issue.
