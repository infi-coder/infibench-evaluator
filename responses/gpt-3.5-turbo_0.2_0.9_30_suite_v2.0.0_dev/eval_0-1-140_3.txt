With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for using icons has changed slightly. You can use the following code to achieve the same result as your previous code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

In Font Awesome 5, the font family name has changed to "Font Awesome 5 Free" and the font weight needs to be set to 900 to display the solid version of the icon. You can also use "Font Awesome 5 Brands" for brand icons and "Font Awesome 5 Pro" for the pro version of the icons if you have a license.
