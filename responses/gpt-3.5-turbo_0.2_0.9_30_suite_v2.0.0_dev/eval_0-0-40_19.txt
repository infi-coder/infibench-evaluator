The error message you are seeing indicates that there is an issue with the line endings in the `npm` executable file. This is a common issue when using files created in Windows on a Linux system.

To fix this issue, you can use the `dos2unix` command to convert the line endings of the `npm` executable file. Here are the steps:

1. Install the `dos2unix` package using the command `sudo apt-get install dos2unix`.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `npm` executable file is located using the command `cd /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/`.
3. Convert the line endings of the `npm` executable file using the command `sudo dos2unix npm`.
4. Make the `npm` executable file executable using the command `sudo chmod +x npm`.
5. Try running the `npm -v` command again.

This should fix the issue and allow you to use `npm` without any problems.
