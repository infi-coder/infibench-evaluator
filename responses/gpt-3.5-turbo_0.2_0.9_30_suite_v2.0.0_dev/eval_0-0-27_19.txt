It seems like you are trying to fetch data from a GraphQL API using Apollo Client, but the loading state hangs at `true` and fails to fetch data. 

One possible reason for this issue could be that the GraphQL API you are trying to fetch data from is not accessible or not responding. 

To verify this, you can try accessing the GraphQL API directly from your browser or a tool like Postman. If you are unable to access the API, then you need to check the API endpoint and make sure it is correct and accessible.

Another possible reason could be that there is an issue with your Apollo Client configuration. You can try logging the `apolloClient` object to see if it is properly configured and connected to the API endpoint.

Also, make sure that you have installed all the required dependencies for Apollo Client and GraphQL. You can check the `package.json` file to see if all the required dependencies are installed.

If none of the above solutions work, you can try using the `fetchPolicy` option in the `useQuery` hook to force a network request. For example, you can set the `fetchPolicy` to `network-only` to always fetch data from the network and bypass the cache.

```javascript
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES, {
  fetchPolicy: 'network-only',
});
```

I hope this helps you resolve the issue.
