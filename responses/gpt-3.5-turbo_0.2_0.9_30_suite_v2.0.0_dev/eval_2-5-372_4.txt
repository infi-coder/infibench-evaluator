It seems that there might be a version conflict between the Hibernate Validator version that is included in your Spring Boot parent pom and the version that is resolved by Maven. 

You can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from your Spring Boot parent pom and explicitly include the version that you want to use in your project. You can do this by adding the following to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

This will exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from the Spring Boot starter validation and explicitly include the version that you want to use.

Alternatively, you can try to upgrade your Spring Boot version to a newer one that includes a compatible version of Hibernate Validator.
