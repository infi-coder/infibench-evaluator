Here are some steps you can try to solve the issue:

1. Check if the Jupyter package is installed in your virtual environment. You can do this by activating the environment and running `conda list` or `pip list` depending on how you installed Jupyter.

2. If Jupyter is not installed, install it using `conda install jupyter` or `pip install jupyter`.

3. Make sure that the Jupyter extension is installed in VS Code. You can check this by going to the Extensions tab and searching for "Jupyter".

4. If the extension is not installed, install it and restart VS Code.

5. Try launching Jupyter notebook again from within VS Code. If it still doesn't work, try launching it from the command line using `jupyter notebook` and see if you get any error messages.

6. If you get an error message, try running `jupyter troubleshoot` to see if it can identify the issue.

7. If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling both VS Code and Miniconda.

Hopefully, one of these steps will solve the issue and allow you to launch Jupyter notebook from within VS Code.
