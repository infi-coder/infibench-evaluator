Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Run the following command to convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   This command will prompt you to enter a passphrase for your private key. If you don't want to use a passphrase, just press Enter.

3. After entering the passphrase (or not), the command will convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key and save it to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

4. If you want to use the converted RSA private key to access the server, you need to send the new `id_rsa` file to the server administrator.

5. You don't need to transfer the `id_rsa.pub` file because it is just the public key that corresponds to your private key. The server administrator already has your public key, so you don't need to send it again.

Note: If you have multiple SSH key pairs, make sure you specify the correct file path for the key you want to convert.
