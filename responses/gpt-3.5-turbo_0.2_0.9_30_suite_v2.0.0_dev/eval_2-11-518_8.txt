The Rule of 5 is not outdated, as it is still relevant and important in modern C++ programming. While it is true that implicit constructors and destructors work fine for aggregate data structures, there are many cases where a class needs to manage resources, such as memory, files, or network connections. In these cases, it is important to define the appropriate constructors and destructors to ensure proper resource management.

While it is possible to use smart pointers to manage resources, this does not necessarily eliminate the need for user-defined constructors and destructors. Smart pointers can help simplify resource management, but they do not replace the need for proper initialization and cleanup of resources.

In summary, the Rule of 5 is still relevant and important in modern C++ programming, as it helps ensure proper resource management in classes that need it. While smart pointers can help simplify resource management, they do not eliminate the need for user-defined constructors and destructors in all cases.
