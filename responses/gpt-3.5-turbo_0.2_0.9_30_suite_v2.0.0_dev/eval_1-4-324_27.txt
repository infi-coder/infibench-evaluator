You can use the `tidyr` package in R to split a comma and colon separated column into respective columns. Here's how you can do it:

```r
library(tidyr)

mySplit <- function(df) {
  df %>% 
    separate(col1, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = ",|:", remove = FALSE) %>%
    select(-col1)
}
```

In the above function, we first use the `separate()` function to split the `col1` column into three separate columns using `,` and `:` as separators. We specify the new column names as `name`, `Age`, and `City` using the `into` argument. We also set `remove = FALSE` to keep the original `col1` column in the resulting data frame.

Finally, we use the `select()` function to remove the original `col1` column from the data frame.

You can call this function by passing your data frame `df` as an argument:

```r
result <- mySplit(df)
```

This will return a data frame with three columns `name`, `Age`, and `City`, as shown in your desired output.
