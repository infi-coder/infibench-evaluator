If you want to use the same version of Java that is used by the Maven task, you can specify the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the location of the JDK that Maven is using.

To find out which version of Java Maven is using, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```
mvn -version
```

This will display the version of Maven and the version of Java that it is using.

Once you know the location of the JDK that Maven is using, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to that location. For example, if Maven is using JDK version 1.8.0_181 and it is installed in the `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64` directory, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable like this:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
```

You can add this line to your shell profile (e.g. `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) to make it persistent across terminal sessions.

After setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, you should be able to run the Maven wrapper using the same version of Java that Maven is using.
