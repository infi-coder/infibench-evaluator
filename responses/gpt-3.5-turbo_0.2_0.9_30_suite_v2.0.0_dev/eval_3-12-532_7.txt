The `FormatException` is thrown when the JSON string is not properly formatted. In your case, it seems that the response body is not a valid JSON string.

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the response body: You can print the response body to the console to see if it is a valid JSON string. If it is not a valid JSON string, you need to check the PHP file that generates the response.

2. Check the headers: Make sure that the response headers are set to `Content-Type: application/json`. If the headers are not set correctly, the response may not be recognized as a JSON string.

3. Check the encoding: Make sure that the encoding of the response is set to `utf-8`. If the encoding is not set correctly, the response may not be decoded properly.

4. Use a try-catch block: Wrap the `json.decode()` method in a try-catch block to catch the `FormatException` and handle it appropriately. For example, you can return an error message to the user or log the error to the console.

Here is an updated version of your code with the try-catch block:

```dart
Future<String> iniciarSesion() async{
  var usuario = textUsuario.text;
  var password = textPassword.text;
  var nombreUsuario;
  var url ="http://192.168.1.37/usuario.php";

  //Metodo post
  var response = await http.post(
    url,
    headers:{ "Accept": "application/json" } ,
    body: { "usuario": '$usuario',"password": '$password'},
    encoding: Encoding.getByName("utf-8")
  );

  try {
    List data = json.decode(response.body);
    // handle the decoded data
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error decoding JSON: $e');
    // handle the error
  }
}
```
