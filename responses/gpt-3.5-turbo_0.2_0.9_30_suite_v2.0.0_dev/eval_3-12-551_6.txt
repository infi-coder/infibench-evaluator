Either wrap your custom appbar into a `PreferredSize` widget or implement `PreferredSizeWidget`. 

In your case, you can implement `PreferredSizeWidget` by adding the `preferredSize` property to your `AppBarDesign` class. Here's how you can modify your `AppBarDesign` class:

```dart
class AppBarDesign extends StatelessWidget implements PreferredSizeWidget {
  AppBarDesign(Key key, this.title) : super(key: key);

  final title;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new AppBar(
      title: new Text(title),
    );
  }

  @override
  Size get preferredSize => new Size.fromHeight(kToolbarHeight);
}
```

By implementing `PreferredSizeWidget`, you are telling Flutter the size of your custom app bar, which is required for it to be used as the `appBar` property of a `Scaffold`.
