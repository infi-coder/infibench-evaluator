The error message "419 Page Expired" is related to CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection. Laravel includes CSRF protection middleware by default, which generates a token for each form submitted to the application. This token is used to verify that the authenticated user is the one actually making the requests to the application.

When you log out from one tab, the CSRF token is invalidated, and the user is logged out from all tabs. However, if you try to log out from the other tab after the token has been invalidated, you will get the "419 Page Expired" error because the token is no longer valid.

To avoid this error, you can add a check in your logout function to see if the user is still authenticated before logging them out. Here's an example:

```
public function logout(Request $request)
{
    if (Auth::check()) {
        Auth::logout();
        $request->session()->invalidate();
        $request->session()->regenerateToken();
    }

    return redirect('/');
}
```

This code checks if the user is still authenticated before logging them out. If they are, it logs them out and invalidates the session. It also regenerates the CSRF token to ensure that the user can log in again without any issues.

By adding this check, you can ensure that the user is always logged out, even if they try to log out from an expired session.
