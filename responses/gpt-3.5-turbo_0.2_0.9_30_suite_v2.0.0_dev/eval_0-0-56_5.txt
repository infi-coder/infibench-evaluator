It seems like the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. When you run `npm run vite` inside the container, it starts the Vite server on the container's localhost, which is not accessible from outside the container.

To fix this, you need to tell Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`. This will make the server accessible from outside the container. You can do this by adding the `host` option to your Vite config:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0'
    }
})
```

With this configuration, Vite will bind to all available network interfaces, including the Docker container's network interface.

Once you've made this change, you should be able to access the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.
