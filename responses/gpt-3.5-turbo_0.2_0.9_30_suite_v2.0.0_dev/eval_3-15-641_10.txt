You can try using the following VBA code to get the local path of the OneDrive folder:

```
Sub GetOneDriveLocalPath()
    Dim objFSO As Object
    Dim objShell As Object
    Dim objFolder As Object
    Dim strOneDrivePath As String
    
    Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    Set objShell = CreateObject("Shell.Application")
    Set objFolder = objShell.Namespace(13) '13 is the OneDrive folder type
    
    If Not objFolder Is Nothing Then
        strOneDrivePath = objFolder.Self.Path
        MsgBox strOneDrivePath
    End If
    
    Set objFolder = Nothing
    Set objShell = Nothing
    Set objFSO = Nothing
End Sub
```

This code uses the Windows Shell object to get the OneDrive folder and its local path. You can modify it to search for the "2021 Tenders" folder within the OneDrive folder and return its path. However, keep in mind that this may be slow if the OneDrive folder contains a large number of files and folders.
