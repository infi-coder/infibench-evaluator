The issue you are facing could be due to the compatibility of the Selenium WebDriver with Excel 2019. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Selenium WebDriver installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Check if the reference to the Selenium Type Library is correctly set in the VBA editor. To do this, go to Tools > References and make sure the checkbox next to "Selenium Type Library" is checked.

3. Try using a different browser driver. For example, if you are currently using the Internet Explorer driver, try using the Chrome driver instead.

4. Try running the code in compatibility mode. To do this, right-click on the Excel shortcut and select Properties. Then, go to the Compatibility tab and check the box next to "Run this program in compatibility mode for" and select "Windows 8" or "Windows 7" from the dropdown menu.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try running the code on a different machine with Excel 2019 installed to see if the issue is specific to your machine.

I hope one of these solutions helps you resolve the issue.
