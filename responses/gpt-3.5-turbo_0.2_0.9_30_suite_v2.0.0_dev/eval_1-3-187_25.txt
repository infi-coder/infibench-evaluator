You can use the following function to replace the elements in the `b` list with the elements in the `rest` list and then replace the corresponding elements in the `last` list with the updated `b` list.

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    # Replace the first 4 elements in b with the elements in rest
    b[:4] = rest
    
    # Replace the corresponding elements in last with the updated b list
    for i in range(len(last)):
        if last[i] in b:
            last[i] = b[b.index(last[i])]
    
    return last
```

You can call this function with your example lists as follows:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

print(ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last))
```

This will output:

```
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```
