When you set `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file, it means that the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your application. 

Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. They are used by the browser's developer tools to allow you to debug your TypeScript code directly in the browser.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the browser's developer tools will not be able to map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. This means that you will not be able to debug your TypeScript code directly in the browser.

However, setting `"sourceMap": false` can improve the performance of your application, as the browser will not have to download the source map files. This can be particularly useful in production environments where performance is critical.

In summary, setting `"sourceMap": false` will not have any visible effect on your application, but it will affect your ability to debug your TypeScript code directly in the browser.
