Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the following command:

```
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you to enter your current passphrase for the key and then allow you to enter a new passphrase (if desired). After that, the key will be converted to RSA format and saved to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

As for your second question, you do not need to transfer your `id_rsa.pub` file as it is simply the public key that corresponds to your private key. The conversion process only affects the private key. However, you may need to provide the new RSA public key to the server administrator if they require it. You can generate the new public key with the following command:

```
ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

This command will output the new RSA public key to the `id_rsa.pub` file in your `~/.ssh` directory.
