The issue might be that `ContentView_Previews` is using `@State` instead of `@Binding`. Try changing `@State` to `@Binding` in `ContentView_Previews` and pass a `Bool` value to `selected` instead of using `@State`. For example:

```
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: .constant(false))
    }
}
``` 

This should update the view when the button is clicked.
