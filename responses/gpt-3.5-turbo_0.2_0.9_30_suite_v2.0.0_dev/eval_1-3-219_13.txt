Here are some steps you can try to solve the issue:

1. Make sure that the Jupyter extension is installed in VS Code. You can check this by going to the Extensions tab on the left-hand side of the VS Code window and searching for "Jupyter". If it is not installed, install it and restart VS Code.

2. Check that the correct Python environment is selected in VS Code. You can do this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left-hand corner of the VS Code window. Make sure that the environment you want to use (in this case, "da38") is selected.

3. Try launching Jupyter Notebook from the command line. Open a terminal in VS Code and activate the "da38" environment by running the command `conda activate da38`. Then, run the command `jupyter notebook` to launch Jupyter Notebook. If this works, try launching Jupyter Notebook from within VS Code again.

4. If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling both VS Code and Miniconda. Make sure to completely remove all files associated with both programs before reinstalling.

Hopefully, one of these steps will solve the issue and allow you to launch Jupyter Notebook from within VS Code.
