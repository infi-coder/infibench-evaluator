You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate Power Query. Here's an example code snippet:

```
Sub RefreshPowerQuery()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections("Query - MyQueryName") ' Replace with your query name
    conn.Refresh
End Sub
```

You can also modify the query definition using VBA, like this:

```
Sub ModifyPowerQuery()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections("Query - MyQueryName") ' Replace with your query name
    conn.OLEDBConnection.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE MyColumn > 10" ' Replace with your SQL query
    conn.Refresh
End Sub
```

Note that you need to replace "Query - MyQueryName" with the actual name of your Power Query.
