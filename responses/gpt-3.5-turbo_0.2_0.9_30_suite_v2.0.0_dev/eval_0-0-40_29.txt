The error message you are seeing indicates that there is an issue with the line endings in the `npm` executable file. This is a common issue when working with files across different operating systems.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the `npm` executable file in a text editor that supports changing line endings (e.g. Visual Studio Code).
2. Change the line endings from `CRLF` to `LF`.
3. Save the file and try running the `npm -v` command again.

If this does not work, you can try reinstalling `npm` using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

This should install the latest version of `npm` and set it up correctly.
