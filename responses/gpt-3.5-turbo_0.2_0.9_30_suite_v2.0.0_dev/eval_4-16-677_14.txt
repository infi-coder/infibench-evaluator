The issue with your script is that the variable `$searchT` is enclosed in single quotes within the `if` statement. Single quotes prevent variable expansion, so `$searchT` is not being replaced with the user input. To fix this, you can use double quotes instead of single quotes:

```
if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" && wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")
else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi
```

This should allow the script to correctly compare the user input with the output of the `grep` command.
