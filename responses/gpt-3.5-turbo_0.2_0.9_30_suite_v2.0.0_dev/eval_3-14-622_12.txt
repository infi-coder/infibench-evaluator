To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol in SwiftUI, you need to define a `fill` method that takes a `ContentShape` and a `View` as parameters. Here's an example implementation:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        Color.red
    }
}
```

Then you can use it like this:

```
Circle()
    .fill(RedView())
```

This should resolve the error you were seeing.
