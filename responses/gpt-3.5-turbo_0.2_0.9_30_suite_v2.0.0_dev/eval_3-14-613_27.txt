This error message usually occurs when the preview target is not selected or is not included in the current scheme. Try selecting the preview target by going to Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme and selecting the preview target under the "Build" tab. If the target is not listed, try adding it to the scheme by going to Product > Scheme > Manage Schemes and checking the box next to the preview target.
