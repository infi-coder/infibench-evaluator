The error message suggests that your current PHP version or extensions may not be compatible with Laravel 9. 

First, make sure that you have PHP version 8.0 or higher installed on your system. You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -v
```

If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you can upgrade it to the latest version by following the instructions for your operating system.

Next, check that you have the required PHP extensions installed. Laravel 9 requires the following extensions:

- BCMath
- Ctype
- Fileinfo
- JSON
- Mbstring
- OpenSSL
- PDO
- Tokenizer
- XML

You can check if these extensions are installed by running the following command:

```bash
php -m
```

If any of the required extensions are missing, you can install them using your system's package manager or by compiling them from source.

Finally, make sure that you have the latest version of Composer installed. You can update Composer by running the following command:

```bash
composer self-update
```

After making sure that your system meets all the requirements, try running the `composer create-project` command again.
