To create an index on a property in a Mongoose schema using Nest.js, you can use the `@Schema` decorator to define the schema and then use the `@Prop` decorator to define the properties of the schema. To create an index on a property, you can pass an object with the `index` property set to `true` as an option to the `@Prop` decorator.

Here's an example:

```javascript
import { Prop, Schema, SchemaFactory } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { Document } from 'mongoose';

@Schema()
export class MySchema extends Document {
  @Prop({ required: true, index: true })
  type: string;

  @Prop()
  creationDate: string;

  @Prop()
  name: string;
}

export const MySchema = SchemaFactory.createForClass(MySchema);
```

In this example, an index is created on the `type` property with the `index` option set to `true`. Note that you don't need to call the `index()` method on the schema factory to create the index. The `@Prop` decorator takes care of creating the index for you.
