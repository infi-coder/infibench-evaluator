It seems that there might be a dependency conflict between the version of Hibernate Validator that is included in your project and the one that is included in your JBoss server. 

You can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from your project and let JBoss provide its own version. To do this, add the following exclusion to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

This will exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from the Spring Boot starter validation, allowing JBoss to provide its own version.

Alternatively, you can try to force the use of the Hibernate Validator version that is included in your project by adding the following dependency to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.5.Final-redhat-2</version>
</dependency>
```

This will force the use of the same version of Hibernate Validator that is included in your project, which might solve the issue.
