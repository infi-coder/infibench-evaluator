Developer Mode is not a feature that can be enabled on iOS 16.0. It is possible that the alert you received is related to a specific app or testing environment. 

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check with the app developer or testing team to see if they have any specific instructions for enabling Developer Mode for their app.

2. Make sure that your device is properly provisioned for testing. This may involve installing a provisioning profile or certificate on your device.

3. Try restarting your device and attempting to run the app again.

4. If none of the above steps work, you may need to contact Apple Support for further assistance.
