You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and preserve the order in which they appear in your code. Note that this may result in warnings or errors from third-party libraries if their required include order is not maintained. 

Alternatively, you can specify the order of includes manually using the `IncludeCategories` option in your `.clang-format` file. This allows you to group your includes into categories and specify the order in which they should appear. Here's an example:

```
IncludeCategories:
  - Regex:           '^<.*\.h>'
    Priority:        2
  - Regex:           '^<.*>'
    Priority:        1
  - Regex:           '^".*\.h"'
    Priority:        3
  - Regex:           '^".*"'
    Priority:        4
```

This will group system includes (`<*.h>`) first, followed by other system includes (`<*>`), then local includes (`"*.h"`) and finally other local includes (`"*"`). You can adjust the priorities and regular expressions to suit your needs.
