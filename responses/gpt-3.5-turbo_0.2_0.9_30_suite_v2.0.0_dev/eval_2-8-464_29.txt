The error message "fork/exec /var/task/main: no such file or directory" indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file "main" in the expected location. This is likely due to the fact that the executable file was built on a Windows platform and is not compatible with the Linux environment that Lambda functions run on.

To resolve this issue, you need to build the executable file on a Linux environment or use a cross-compiler to build the executable file that is compatible with the Linux environment. Here are the steps to build the executable file on a Linux environment:

1. Set up a Linux environment, such as a virtual machine or a Docker container.
2. Copy the Go source code to the Linux environment.
3. Install Go on the Linux environment.
4. Build the executable file using the following command:

```
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o main main.go
```

This command builds the executable file for the Linux environment with the name "main".

5. Zip the executable file using the following command:

```
zip main.zip main
```

This command creates a zip file "main.zip" that contains the executable file "main".

6. Upload the zip file "main.zip" to the Lambda function.

7. Test the Lambda function to verify that it is working correctly.

After following these steps, the Lambda function should be able to find the executable file "main" and execute it without any issues.
