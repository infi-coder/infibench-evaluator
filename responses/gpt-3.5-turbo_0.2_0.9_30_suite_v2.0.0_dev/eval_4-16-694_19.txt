You can use `grep` with a regular expression to match the `lang` attribute and extract its value. Here's an example command that should work for both cases:

```
curl -Ls yahoo.com | grep -oP 'lang="\K[^"]+' | head -1
```

This command uses the `-o` option to only output the matched text, and the `-P` option to enable Perl-compatible regular expressions. The regular expression `lang="\K[^"]+` matches the `lang` attribute followed by its value, and the `\K` sequence discards the `lang="` prefix from the match. The `[^"]+` pattern matches one or more characters that are not double quotes, which corresponds to the value of the `lang` attribute.

Note that this command assumes that the `lang` attribute appears in the first line of the HTML code. If it can appear later in the code, you may need to remove the `head -1` part and process the output differently.
