You need to add two things to your `~/.zshenv`. First, add the rbenv initialization itself by adding the line `eval "$(rbenv init -)"` to the file. Second, add the ruby path by adding the line `export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"`. 

You might also run the command `rbenv doctor` to check your installation.
