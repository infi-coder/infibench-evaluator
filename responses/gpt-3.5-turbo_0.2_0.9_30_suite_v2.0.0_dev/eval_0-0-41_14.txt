Your code looks correct. However, if the user denies the location access, the code inside the `getCurrentPosition` callback function will not be executed. To handle this case, you can add a second argument to the `getCurrentPosition` method, which is a callback function that will be executed if the location access is denied. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

With this code, if the user denies the location access, the message "User not allowed" will be logged to the console.
