To specify an array of objects with a specific structure, you can define an interface for the object and then use that interface as the type for the array. Here's an example:

```typescript
interface Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}

const bagTotal = (products: Product[]) => {
  // function does stuff
}
```

In this example, we define an interface called `Product` that has three properties: `name`, `price`, and `description`. Then we use this interface as the type for the `products` parameter in the `bagTotal` function. This ensures that any array passed to `bagTotal` must contain objects with these three properties.
