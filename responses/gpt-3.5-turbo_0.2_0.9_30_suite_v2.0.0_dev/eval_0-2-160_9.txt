When you set `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file, it means that the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your Angular application. 

Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. They are used by the browser's developer tools to help you debug your application. 

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the browser's developer tools will not be able to map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. This means that when you debug your application in the browser, you will see the compiled JavaScript code instead of the original TypeScript code. 

However, setting `"sourceMap": false` can improve the performance of your application, as the browser will not have to load the source map files. It can also reduce the size of your application, as the source map files can be quite large. 

In summary, setting `"sourceMap": false` can improve the performance and reduce the size of your application, but it can make debugging more difficult.
