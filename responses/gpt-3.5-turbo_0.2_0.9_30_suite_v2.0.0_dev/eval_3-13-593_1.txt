To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to do the following:

1. Update your Android Studio to the latest version.
2. Add the following dependencies to your app-level build.gradle file:

```
android {
    ...
    buildFeatures {
        compose true
    }
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:1.0.0"
}
```

3. Sync your project with Gradle.
4. Start using Jetpack Compose in your project.

Note that Jetpack Compose requires Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) or higher, and it's recommended to use the latest stable version of Jetpack Compose.
