You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and preserve the order in which they appear in your code. Note that this may result in warnings or errors from your compiler if the order of includes is not correct for certain libraries or dependencies.

Alternatively, you can specify the order of includes that you want to use by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
IncludeCategories:
  - Regex: '^<.*\.h>'
    Priority: 2
  - Regex: '^<.*'
    Priority: 1
  - Regex: '^".*\.h"'
    Priority: 2
  - Regex: '^".*'
    Priority: 1
```

This will define four categories of includes: system includes (`<...>`), system includes (`<...>`), local includes (`"...h"`), and local includes (`"...`"). You can adjust the priorities and regular expressions to match your specific needs.
