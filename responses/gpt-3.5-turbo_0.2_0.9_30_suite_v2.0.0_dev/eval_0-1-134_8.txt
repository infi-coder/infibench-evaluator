It sounds like you may be referring to Emmet, a plugin that allows you to write HTML and CSS code using shorthand syntax. To use Emmet, you need to install it as a plugin in your code editor. Once installed, you can use shorthand syntax to write HTML and CSS code. For example, to create a div with a class name of "classname", you can type "div.classname" and press the Tab key. This will expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`. Make sure you have Emmet installed and enabled in your code editor and that you are using the correct syntax.
