Yes, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to retrieve the description of a Windows service. Here's an example:

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description | Out-GridView
```

This will display the name, display name, and description of all Windows services in a grid view. You can also filter the results by specifying the name of a specific service:

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service -Filter "Name='ServiceName'" | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description
```

Replace `ServiceName` with the name of the service you want to retrieve information for.
