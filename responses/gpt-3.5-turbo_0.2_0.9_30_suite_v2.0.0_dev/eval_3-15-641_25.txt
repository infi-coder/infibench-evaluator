You can use the Windows API function `SHGetKnownFolderPath` to retrieve the local path of the OneDrive folder. Here's an example code snippet:

```
Option Explicit

Private Declare PtrSafe Function SHGetKnownFolderPath Lib "shell32.dll" _
    (ByRef rfid As Any, ByVal dwFlags As Long, ByVal hToken As LongPtr, ByRef pszPath As Any) As Long

Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrive As String = "{A52BBA46-E9E1-435f-B3D9-28DAA648C0F6}"
Private Const KNOWN_FOLDER_FLAG_SIMPLE_IDLIST As Long = &H1000

Sub GetOneDriveLocalPath()
    Dim path As String
    Dim hr As Long
    
    hr = SHGetKnownFolderPath(StrPtr(FOLDERID_SkyDrive), KNOWN_FOLDER_FLAG_SIMPLE_IDLIST, 0, path)
    
    If hr = 0 Then
        MsgBox "OneDrive local path: " & path
    Else
        MsgBox "Failed to retrieve OneDrive local path"
    End If
End Sub
```

This code retrieves the local path of the OneDrive folder using its known folder ID (`FOLDERID_SkyDrive`). You can modify the code to search for the "2021 Tenders" folder within the OneDrive folder and return its path.
