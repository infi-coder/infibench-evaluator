It seems that there might be a version conflict between the Hibernate Validator version that is included in your Spring Boot parent POM and the version that is resolved by Maven. 

You can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from your Spring Boot parent POM and add the desired version as a direct dependency in your project's POM. 

To do this, add the following exclusion to your Spring Boot parent POM:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

Then, add the desired version of Hibernate Validator as a direct dependency in your project's POM:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

This should resolve any version conflicts and allow you to use the @NotEmpty and @NotBlank annotations as expected.
