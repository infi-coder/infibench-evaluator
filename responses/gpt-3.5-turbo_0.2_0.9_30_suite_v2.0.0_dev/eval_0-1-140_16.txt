With Font Awesome 5, you need to change the font-family to "Font Awesome 5 Free" or "Font Awesome 5 Brands" depending on the type of icon you want to use. Here's an example of how to update your code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

Note that you need to make sure that you have included the correct Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project. You can download the CSS file from the Font Awesome website or use a CDN.
