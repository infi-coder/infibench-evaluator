Your `sed` command is not correctly removing the `?` and everything after it. Instead of `'s/\?.*//g'`, try using `'s/\?.*$//'`. This should remove the `?` and everything after it. Also, you can simplify your `find` command by using the `-execdir` option instead of `-exec`. Here's the updated command:

```
find . -type f -name '*\?*' -execdir sh -c 'mv "$1" "${1/\?.*/}"' sh {} \;
``` 

This should remove the `?` and everything after it from all file names that contain a `?`.
