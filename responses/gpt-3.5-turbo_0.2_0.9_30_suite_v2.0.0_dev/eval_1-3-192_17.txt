Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split('[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

Here, we first check if the input string is empty or not. If it is empty, we return an empty string. Otherwise, we split the string into words using the `re.split()` function, which splits the string based on the given pattern (in this case, either a dash or an underscore).

We then capitalize the first letter of each word except the first word, and join them together to form the camel case string. The first word is not capitalized if it was not capitalized in the original string.

Note that we need to import the `re` module to use the `re.split()` function.
