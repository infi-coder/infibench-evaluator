To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Android Studio installed. Then, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your project in Android Studio.
2. In the `build.gradle` file for your app module, add the following lines to the `dependencies` block:

```
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:1.0.0"
}
```

3. Sync your project with Gradle to download the Compose dependencies.
4. Create a new Composable function in your project and start using Compose!

Note that you may need to update your project's minimum SDK version to 21 or higher to use Jetpack Compose.
