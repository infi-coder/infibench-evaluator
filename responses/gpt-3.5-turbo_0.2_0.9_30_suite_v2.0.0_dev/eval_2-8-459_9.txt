It seems like the go module system is unable to download the dependency from the private repository. Here are a few things you can try to debug the issue:

1. Check if the private repository is accessible from computer B. You can try to clone the repository manually and see if it works.

2. Check if the authentication credentials are set up correctly on computer B. You can try to run `go env` and check if the `GOPRIVATE` and `GONOPROXY` environment variables are set correctly.

3. Try to run `go mod download` to download the dependencies manually. This will download the dependencies and store them in the module cache. Then try to build the program again.

4. If the above steps don't work, you can try to use the `GOPROXY` environment variable to specify a proxy server that can access the private repository. You can set up a local proxy server or use a third-party proxy server like Athens or Artifactory.

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try to enable verbose logging for the go module system by running `go build -v`. This will give you more information about what's going wrong and help you debug the issue.

I hope this helps you debug the issue.
