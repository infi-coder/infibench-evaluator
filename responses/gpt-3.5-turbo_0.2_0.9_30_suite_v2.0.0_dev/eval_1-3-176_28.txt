The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Install zlib development libraries: 

   On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can install zlib development libraries using the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
   ```

   On CentOS or Red Hat-based systems, you can install zlib development libraries using the following command:

   ```
   sudo yum install zlib-devel
   ```

   On macOS, you can install zlib development libraries using Homebrew:

   ```
   brew install zlib
   ```

2. Reinstall Pillow:

   After installing the zlib development libraries, you can try reinstalling Pillow using pip:

   ```
   pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall pillow
   ```

   Alternatively, you can try installing Pillow from a pre-built binary wheel using pip:

   ```
   pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall pillow --no-cache-dir --only-binary :all:
   ```

   This should install Pillow without building it from source, which should avoid the missing zlib headers issue.

If the above steps don't work, you can also try installing Pillow using conda instead of pip:

```
conda install pillow
``` 

This should install Pillow along with all its dependencies, including zlib.
