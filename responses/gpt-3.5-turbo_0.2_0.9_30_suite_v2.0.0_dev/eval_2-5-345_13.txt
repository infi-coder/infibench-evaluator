This error occurs because IntelliJ IDEA is using an older version of Maven (3.6.3) that is not compatible with Spring Boot 2.7, which requires Maven 3.8.5.

To fix this error, you can configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the correct version of Maven:

1. Open the IntelliJ IDEA preferences (on macOS) or settings (on Windows and Linux).
2. Navigate to Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.
3. In the "Maven home directory" field, specify the path to the Maven installation that includes version 3.8.5.
4. Click "OK" to save the changes.

After configuring IntelliJ IDEA to use the correct version of Maven, you should be able to import and build your Spring Boot 2.7 project without any issues.
