The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Install zlib development libraries: 

   On Windows, you can download the pre-built zlib library from the Gohlke website (https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#zlib). Choose the appropriate version based on your Python version and system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). Then, install the downloaded file using pip:

   ```
   pip install path/to/downloaded/file.whl
   ```

   On Linux, you can install the zlib development libraries using the package manager:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev  # for Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo yum install zlib-devel     # for CentOS/RHEL
   ```

2. Reinstall Pillow:

   After installing the zlib development libraries, try reinstalling Pillow using pip:

   ```
   pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall pillow
   ```

   This should rebuild Pillow with the required dependencies.

If the above steps don't work, you can also try installing Pillow using conda instead of pip.
