You can add your existing SSH key to Git Bash by following these steps:

1. Open Git Bash and navigate to your home directory by typing `cd ~` and pressing Enter.
2. Create a new directory called `.ssh` by typing `mkdir .ssh` and pressing Enter.
3. Copy your SSH key file (e.g. `id_rsa`) from `D:/keys` to the `.ssh` directory you just created by typing `cp D:/keys/id_rsa ~/.ssh/` and pressing Enter.
4. Change the permissions of your SSH key file to make it readable only by you by typing `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa` and pressing Enter.

That's it! Your existing SSH key should now be available for use in Git Bash.
