The Rule of 5 is not outdated, as there are still cases where you may need to define these special member functions. 

For example, if your class manages a resource that cannot be handled by a smart pointer, such as a file handle or a network socket, you would need to define a destructor to properly release the resource. Similarly, if your class has non-copyable or non-movable members, you would need to define the corresponding copy and move constructors and assignment operators.

While it is true that smart pointers can often be used to manage resources, they may not always be the best solution. Smart pointers can add overhead and may not be suitable for certain types of resources, such as memory-mapped files or shared memory.

In summary, while the Rule of 5 may not always be necessary, it is still a useful guideline to follow when designing classes that manage resources or have non-copyable or non-movable members.
