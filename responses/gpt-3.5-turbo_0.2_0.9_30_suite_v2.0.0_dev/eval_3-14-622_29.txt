To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement the `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_Self)` method in your `RedView` struct. Here's an example implementation:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout ShapeStyle.Shape) {
        shape.fill(Color.red)
    }
}
```

With this implementation, you should be able to use `RedView()` as a fill for your `Circle` shape.
