It seems that the issue is with the `uri` you are using in the `ApolloClient` configuration. The `uri` you are using is not working and that's why the query is not being executed.

You can try using a different `uri` for testing purposes. Here is an example of a working `uri`:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io/graphql',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

Also, make sure that your device or emulator has an active internet connection.
