Yes, you can use the `date_range` function from pandas to create a range of dates for the given year and then calculate the length of the range to get the total number of days in the year.

Here's the implementation of the `DaysInYear` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def DaysInYear(year):
    start_date = pd.to_datetime(f"{year}-01-01")
    end_date = pd.to_datetime(f"{year}-12-31")
    days_in_year = len(pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date))
    return days_in_year
```

This function takes the year as an argument, creates a start date and an end date for the year, and then uses `pd.date_range` to create a range of dates between the start and end dates. Finally, it returns the length of the range, which is the total number of days in the year.

You can call this function with a year as an argument to get the total number of days in that year:

```python
print(DaysInYear(2020)) # Output: 366
print(DaysInYear(2019)) # Output: 365
```
