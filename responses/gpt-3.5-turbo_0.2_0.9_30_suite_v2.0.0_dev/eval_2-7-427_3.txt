For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server's clock is not synchronized with the client's clock, causing the token to expire before it is used. Another possibility is that the session is being regenerated too frequently, causing the token to change before it is used. You can try increasing the SESSION_LIFETIME to see if it resolves the issue. Additionally, you can check if any caching or load balancing configurations on the host domain are affecting the sessions.

For the second issue, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used is not supported by the server. You can try changing the MAIL_ENCRYPTION to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' and see if it resolves the issue. Additionally, you can check if the server requires any specific SSL version or certificate to establish a connection.
