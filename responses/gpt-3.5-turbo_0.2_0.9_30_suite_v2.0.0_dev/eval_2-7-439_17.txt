The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server or local machine.

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Find out which version of PHP you are using. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -v
   ```

2. Once you know which version of PHP you are using, you need to install the `zip` extension for that version of PHP. You can do this by running one of the following commands:

   For PHP 7.4:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install php7.4-zip
   ```

   For PHP 7.3:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install php7.3-zip
   ```

   For PHP 7.2:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install php7.2-zip
   ```

   For PHP 7.1:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install php7.1-zip
   ```

   For PHP 7.0:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install php7.0-zip
   ```

   For PHP 5:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install php5-zip
   ```

3. Once the installation is complete, restart your web server or PHP-FPM service:

   ```
   sudo service apache2 restart
   ```

   or

   ```
   sudo service php-fpm restart
   ```

After completing these steps, you should be able to use the `zip` extension in your PHP code.
