You can specify the path to the Java executable that you want to use by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. Here's how you can do it:

1. Find the path to the Java executable that you want to use. You can do this by running `java -version` in a terminal or command prompt. The output should include the path to the Java executable.

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path that you found in step 1. You can do this by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/java` with the actual path to the Java executable that you found in step 1.

3. Run the Maven wrapper command as usual. Maven will use the Java executable specified in the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

Alternatively, you can also set the `java.home` system property when running the Maven wrapper command. Here's how you can do it:

```
./mvnw -Djava.home=/path/to/java <maven-command>
```

Replace `/path/to/java` with the actual path to the Java executable that you want to use. `<maven-command>` is the Maven command that you want to run, such as `clean install`.
