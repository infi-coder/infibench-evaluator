Yes, you can use the `date_range` function in Pandas to generate a range of dates for the given year and then calculate the length of the range to get the total number of days in the year. Here's an example function `DaysInYear` that takes a year as an argument and returns the total number of days in that year:

```python
import pandas as pd

def DaysInYear(year):
    start_date = pd.to_datetime(f"{year}-01-01")
    end_date = pd.to_datetime(f"{year}-12-31")
    date_range = pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date)
    return len(date_range)
```

This function first creates a `start_date` and an `end_date` using the `to_datetime` function in Pandas. It then generates a range of dates using `date_range` and calculates the length of the range using `len` to get the total number of days in the year. 

You can call this function with a year as an argument to get the total number of days in that year. For example:

```python
print(DaysInYear(2020)) # Output: 366
print(DaysInYear(2019)) # Output: 365
```
