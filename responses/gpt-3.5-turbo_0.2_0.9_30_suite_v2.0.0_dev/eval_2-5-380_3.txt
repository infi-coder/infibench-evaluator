To use the Swagger UI with Spring Boot, you need to make sure that you have the following configurations in your application:

1. Make sure that you have the `@EnableSwagger2` annotation in your Spring Boot application class.

2. Make sure that you have the `@Configuration` annotation in your Swagger configuration class.

3. Make sure that you have the `@Bean` annotation for the `Docket` object in your Swagger configuration class.

Here's an example of how your Swagger configuration class should look like:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableSwagger2
public class SwaggerConfig {

    @Bean
    public Docket api() {
        return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2)
                .select()
                .apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.basePackage("com.example.controller"))
                .paths(PathSelectors.any())
                .build();
    }
}
```

Also, make sure that you have the correct URL for the Swagger UI. It should be `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`, not `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

If you have done all of the above and it still doesn't work, try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser.
