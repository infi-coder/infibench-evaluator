The error message "419 Page Expired" is related to the CSRF token. Laravel uses CSRF tokens to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks. When you log out from one tab, the CSRF token is invalidated, and when you try to log out from the other tab, the token is no longer valid, and you get the "419 Page Expired" error.

To avoid this error, you can add a check in your logout function to see if the CSRF token is still valid. If it is not valid, you can regenerate the token and then log out the user. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```
public function logout(Request $request)
{
    if ($request->session()->regenerateToken()) {
        Auth::logout();
        return redirect('/');
    }
}
```

This code regenerates the CSRF token and then logs out the user. If the token cannot be regenerated, the user is not logged out, and the page is not redirected.
