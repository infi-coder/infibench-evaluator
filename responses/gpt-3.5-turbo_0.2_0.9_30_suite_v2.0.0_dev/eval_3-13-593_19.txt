To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to follow these steps:

1. Make sure your project is using Android Studio 4.2 or later.
2. Add the following dependencies to your app-level build.gradle file:

```
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:1.0.0"
}
```

3. Sync your project with Gradle.
4. Create a new Composable function in your project and start using Jetpack Compose.

That's it! You can now start using Jetpack Compose in your existing project.
