The "f" in `print(f"...")` stands for "formatted string literals" or "f-strings" in Python. It is a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`. 

In your example, the curly braces `{}` are used to embed the values of `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` into the string. The values are evaluated at runtime and then inserted into the string.

For example, if `args.input_directory` is `"/path/to/input"` and `args.output_directory` is `"/path/to/output"`, the output of the `print` statements would be:

```
Input directory: /path/to/input
Output directory: /path/to/output
```

Using f-strings can make your code more concise and easier to read, especially when you need to include variables or expressions in your strings.
