The issue is with the format of the `$theme-colors` map. The values in the map should be in quotes. Here's the revised code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": "#0d6efd",
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace `#0d6efd` with your desired color value.
