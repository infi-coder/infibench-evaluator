The `rename()` method is used to rename the columns of a Pandas DataFrame. In your code, you are trying to use the `rename()` method on a Pandas Series object, which doesn't have the `columns` parameter. 

To rename the "p" column as "mean" in the DataFrame and get the average numbers group by "t" column, you can use the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=df, columns=["t","p","x","y","z"])
    avg = df.groupby("t", sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg = avg.rename(columns={"p": "mean"})
    return avg
```

Here, we first create a DataFrame from the input `df` variable with the specified column names. Then, we group the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column using the `mean()` method. The `reset_index()` method is used to convert the resulting Series object to a DataFrame. Finally, we rename the "p" column as "mean" using the `rename()` method and return the resulting DataFrame.
