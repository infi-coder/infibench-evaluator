Here are some steps you can try to solve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Python extension installed in VS Code. You can check for updates by going to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) and searching for "Python".

2. Check that the correct Python interpreter is selected in VS Code. You can do this by opening the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and searching for "Python: Select Interpreter". Make sure that the interpreter for your "da38" environment is selected.

3. Try launching Jupyter Notebook from the command line to see if it works outside of VS Code. Open a terminal and activate your "da38" environment, then run the command `jupyter notebook`. If it works, try launching it again from within VS Code.

4. If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling the ipykernel package in your "da38" environment. You can do this by running the command `conda uninstall ipykernel` followed by `conda install ipykernel`.

Hopefully one of these steps will solve the issue and allow you to launch Jupyter Notebook from within VS Code.
