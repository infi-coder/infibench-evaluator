For the first issue with the "CSRF token mismatch" error, it seems like the issue could be related to the session driver configuration on the host domain. You mentioned that multiple sessions are being generated for one user, which could be causing the CSRF token to mismatch. You could try changing the session driver to a different one, such as database or redis, to see if that resolves the issue. Additionally, you could check if there are any server-side caching mechanisms in place that could be affecting the sessions.

For the second issue with the email, it seems like the error is related to the SSL version being used. The error message "SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number" suggests that the SSL version being used is not supported by the server. You could try changing the encryption method to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' in your .env file and mail.php configuration file. Additionally, you could try changing the port to 465, which is commonly used for SMTP over SSL/TLS. If that doesn't work, you could try contacting the email provider to see if they have any specific requirements for connecting to their SMTP server.
