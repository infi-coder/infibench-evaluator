The error message suggests that the response from the server is not in the expected JSON format. It looks like the response starts with a '<' character, which indicates that it might be an HTML error page instead of a JSON response.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the URL of the API endpoint. Make sure it is correct and matches the route defined in the controller.

2. Check the response from the server using a tool like Postman or Fiddler. Make sure it is a valid JSON response and not an HTML error page.

3. If the response is an HTML error page, check the server logs to see if there are any errors or exceptions that might be causing the issue.

4. If everything looks correct on the server side, try adding a try-catch block around the `Http.GetJsonAsync` call and log any exceptions that are thrown. This might give you more information about the issue.

5. Finally, you can try using a different HTTP client library like `System.Net.Http.HttpClient` to make the API call and see if that works. Here's an example:

```c#
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Text.Json;

var httpClient = new HttpClient();
var response = await httpClient.GetAsync("/api/Employee/Index");
var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
var empList = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Employee[]>(content);
```

This code uses `HttpClient` to make the API call and `JsonSerializer` to deserialize the JSON response. You can replace the `Http.GetJsonAsync` call with this code and see if it works.
