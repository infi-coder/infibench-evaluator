Yes, the above comment is correct. 

In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's properties and set its initial state. 

Unlike regular methods, constructors cannot be called explicitly like a regular function. They are invoked automatically when a new instance of a class is created using the `new` keyword. 

So, the statement "A constructor cannot be called, it is not a function. It is invoked automatically when a new object is created" is accurate.
