Developer mode is not a feature that can be enabled on iOS 16.0. It is possible that the alert you received is related to a specific app or developer account requirement. 

You can try the following steps to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check if the app you are trying to open is from a trusted source. If it is not, you may need to adjust your device's security settings to allow installation of apps from untrusted sources.

2. Check if your device is registered as a test device with the developer account that created the app. If it is not, you may need to register your device with the developer account and obtain a new provisioning profile.

3. Check if the app requires specific entitlements or permissions that are not available on your device. If this is the case, you may need to contact the app developer or your device manufacturer for further assistance.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to contact the app developer or your device manufacturer for further assistance.
