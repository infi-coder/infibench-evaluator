It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is accessible: Try accessing the module directly from computer B using `go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5`. If this command fails, then it means that the module is not accessible from computer B. In this case, you may need to check your network settings or authentication credentials.

2. Check the module cache: Check if the module is present in the module cache on computer B. The module cache is located at `$GOPATH/pkg/mod`. If the module is not present in the cache, then try running `go mod download github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5` to download the module explicitly.

3. Check the module version: Make sure that the version of the module that you are trying to download (`v0.1.5`) actually exists. You can check the available versions of the module by running `go list -m -versions github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client`.

4. Check the module proxy: If you are using a module proxy (such as `proxy.golang.org`), then make sure that the proxy has the module available. You can check this by running `go list -m -versions -json github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client | jq '.Versions[].Version'` and checking if the version you are trying to download is present in the output.

5. Check the module requirements: Make sure that the module requirements in your `go.mod` file are correct. You can run `go mod tidy` to update the requirements based on the code in your repository.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you debug the issue and get the module downloaded on computer B.
