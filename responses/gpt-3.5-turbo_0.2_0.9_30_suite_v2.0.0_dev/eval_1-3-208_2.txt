The issue with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is present in the `correct` string, which is not what you want. Instead, you should check if all characters in the input string are present in the `correct` string. Here's a modified version of your code that should work:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = set(string.ascii_letters + string.digits)
    return all(char in correct for char in text)

# Example usage:
text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

In this code, we convert the `correct` string to a set for faster membership testing. Then, we use a generator expression with the `all` function to check if all characters in the input string are present in the `correct` set. The `checkString` function returns `True` if the input string satisfies the requirement, and `False` otherwise.
