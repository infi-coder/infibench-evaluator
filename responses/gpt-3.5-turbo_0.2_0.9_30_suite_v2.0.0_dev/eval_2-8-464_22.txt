The error message "fork/exec /var/task/main: no such file or directory" indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file "main" in the expected location "/var/task/". This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The executable file "main" was not included in the zip file that was uploaded to AWS Lambda. Make sure that the executable file is included in the zip file and is located in the root directory of the zip file.

2. The executable file "main" was not built for the correct platform. AWS Lambda runs on Amazon Linux, so the executable file needs to be built for that platform. You can use tools like Docker or AWS SAM CLI to build your Go executable for the correct platform.

3. The executable file "main" was not built with the correct build flags. When building your Go executable, make sure to include the build flags "-ldflags '-s -w'" to reduce the size of the executable and remove debug information.

Try rebuilding your Go executable with the correct build flags and for the correct platform, and include it in the root directory of the zip file that you upload to AWS Lambda.
