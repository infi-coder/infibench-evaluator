You can use the `iter()` method of the vector to create an iterator over its elements, and then use the `min()` method of the iterator to get the minimum value. Here's an example:

```rust
let v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
let min_value = *v.iter().min().unwrap();
println!("Minimum value: {}", min_value);
```

In this example, `v.iter()` creates an iterator over the elements of the vector, and `min()` returns an `Option<&i32>` that represents the minimum value. The `unwrap()` method is used to extract the value from the `Option`, and the `*` operator is used to dereference the resulting reference to an `i32`.
