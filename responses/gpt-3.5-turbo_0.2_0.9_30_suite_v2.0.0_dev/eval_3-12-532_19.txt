The `FormatException` error occurs when the JSON string being decoded is not in the correct format. In your case, it seems that the JSON response from the PHP file is not in the correct format.

To solve this error, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the JSON response from the PHP file using a tool like Postman or Insomnia to ensure that it is in the correct format.

2. If the JSON response is not in the correct format, you will need to modify the PHP file to return the correct format.

3. If the JSON response is in the correct format, you can try to print the response body before decoding it to see if there are any unexpected characters.

4. If there are unexpected characters, you can try to remove them manually or by using a regular expression.

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try using a different JSON decoding library or contact the API provider for assistance.
