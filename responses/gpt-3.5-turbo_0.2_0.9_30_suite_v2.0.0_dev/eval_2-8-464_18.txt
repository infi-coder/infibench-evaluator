The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is because the executable file was built on a Windows platform and is not compatible with the Linux environment that Lambda functions run on.

To fix this issue, you need to build the executable file on a Linux environment or use a tool like `GOOS=linux go build main.go` to build the executable file for Linux environment on Windows.

Here are the steps to build the executable file for Linux environment on Windows:

1. Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Go code is located.
2. Run the following command to build the executable file for Linux environment:

   ```
   set GOOS=linux
   go build main.go
   ```

   This will create an executable file named `main` in the same directory.

3. Zip the `main` executable file using the following command:

   ```
   zip main.zip main
   ```

4. Upload the `main.zip` file to your Lambda function.

After following these steps, your Lambda function should be able to find and execute the `main` executable file without any issues.
