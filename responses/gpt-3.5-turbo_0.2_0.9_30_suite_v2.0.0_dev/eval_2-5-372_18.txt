It seems like there might be a version conflict between the Hibernate Validator version that is included in your Spring Boot parent pom and the version that is included in your Maven dependencies. 

You can try excluding the Hibernate Validator dependency from your Spring Boot parent pom and explicitly including the version that you want in your Maven dependencies. 

To do this, add the following exclusion to your Spring Boot parent pom:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

Then, add the following dependency to your Maven dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

This should ensure that you are using the correct version of Hibernate Validator and resolve any conflicts that may be causing the issue.
