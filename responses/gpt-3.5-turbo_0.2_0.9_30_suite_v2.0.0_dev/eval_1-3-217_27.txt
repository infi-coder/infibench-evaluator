You can use the PyTorch `torch.cat()` function to concatenate the two tensors along the last dimension. Here's the implementation of the `addTensor()` function:

```python
import torch

def addTensor(inps, d):
    # Reshape d to match the shape of inps
    d = d.unsqueeze(-1)
    # Concatenate inps and d along the last dimension
    out = torch.cat((inps, d), dim=-1)
    return out
```

Here, we first reshape `d` to have a size of [64, 161, 1] using the `unsqueeze()` function. Then, we concatenate `inps` and `d` along the last dimension using the `torch.cat()` function, which results in a tensor of size [64, 161, 2]. Finally, we return the concatenated tensor.
