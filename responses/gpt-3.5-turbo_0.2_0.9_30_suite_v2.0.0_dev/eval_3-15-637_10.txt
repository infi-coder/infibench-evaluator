The issue you are facing might be due to the compatibility issue between the Selenium WebDriver and the version of Internet Explorer installed on your machine. 

Excel 2019 comes with Internet Explorer 11, which is not fully compatible with the latest version of Selenium WebDriver. You can try the following solutions to resolve the issue:

1. Use a different browser: Instead of Internet Explorer, you can try using Chrome or Firefox as they are fully compatible with Selenium WebDriver.

2. Downgrade Internet Explorer: You can try downgrading Internet Explorer to version 8 or 9, which are compatible with Selenium WebDriver. However, this might not be a feasible solution as it can affect other applications that rely on Internet Explorer.

3. Use a different version of Selenium WebDriver: You can try using an older version of Selenium WebDriver that is compatible with Internet Explorer 11. You can download the older version from the Selenium website.

4. Use a different programming language: You can try using a different programming language like Python or Java, which have better support for Selenium WebDriver.

I hope one of these solutions will work for you.
