You can use the `tidyr` package in R to split the column into separate columns based on the delimiter. Here's how you can do it:

```r
library(tidyr)

mySplit <- function(df) {
  df_split <- separate(df, col1, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = ",|:")
  return(df_split)
}
```

In the above function, we first load the `tidyr` package. Then we use the `separate` function to split the `col1` column into three separate columns `name`, `Age`, and `City`. We specify the delimiter as `,|:` which means that the column will be split whenever a comma or a colon is encountered. Finally, we return the resulting data frame `df_split`.

You can call this function on your example data frame as follows:

```r
df <- data.frame(col1 = c("name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC", "name:Tom,Age:25,City:NA"))
mySplit(df)
```

This will give you the desired output:

```
     name Age City
1 Michael  31  NYC
2     Tom  25   NA
```
