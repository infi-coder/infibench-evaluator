To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol in SwiftUI, you need to implement the `fill` method that takes a `ContentShape` and a `style` parameter. Here's an example implementation for your `RedView`:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(Color.red)
    }
}
```

This implementation returns a `Circle` shape filled with the color red. You can then use `RedView()` as a fill style for any shape in your SwiftUI views.
