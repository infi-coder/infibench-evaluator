It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is present in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is not present in the cache, you can try to download it manually by running:

   ```bash
   go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

2. Check if there are any network issues preventing the module from being downloaded. You can try to download the module manually using `git`:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client.git $GOPATH/src/github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
   git checkout v0.1.5
   ```

   If there are any network issues, you should see an error message that can help you diagnose the problem.

3. Check if there are any issues with your `GOPRIVATE` environment variable. If the module is in a private repository, you need to set the `GOPRIVATE` environment variable to include the domain name. For example:

   ```bash
   export GOPRIVATE=github.ibm.com
   ```

   This tells the Go module system to treat all modules in the `github.ibm.com` domain as private, even if they are not explicitly marked as such.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you diagnose the issue and get the module downloaded to the module cache on computer B.
