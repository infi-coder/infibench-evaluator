When you set `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file, it means that the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your TypeScript code. 

Source maps are used to map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code, which can be helpful for debugging purposes. When source maps are enabled, you can use your browser's developer tools to debug your TypeScript code directly in the browser.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the generated JavaScript code will not have a reference to the original TypeScript code, so you won't be able to debug your TypeScript code directly in the browser. However, this can result in a smaller bundle size and faster compilation times, since the compiler doesn't have to generate the source map files.

So, if you set `"sourceMap": false`, you may not notice any immediate changes in your app, but it can have an impact on your development workflow and debugging capabilities.
