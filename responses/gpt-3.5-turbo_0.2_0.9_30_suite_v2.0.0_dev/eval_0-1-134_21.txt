It sounds like you might be referring to Emmet, a plugin that allows you to write HTML and CSS code more quickly and efficiently. 

To use Emmet, you can type a shorthand code and then press the "Tab" key to expand it into the full HTML or CSS code. For example, typing "div.classname" and then pressing "Tab" should expand into `<div class="classname"></div>`. 

If this isn't working for you, make sure that you have Emmet installed and enabled in your code editor. The specific steps to do this may vary depending on your editor, but you can usually find instructions by searching for "install Emmet in [your editor name]." 

Additionally, make sure that you are typing the shorthand code correctly. Emmet has a specific syntax, so if you make a mistake in your shorthand code, it may not expand correctly. You can find a list of Emmet shorthand codes and their expansions on the Emmet website.
