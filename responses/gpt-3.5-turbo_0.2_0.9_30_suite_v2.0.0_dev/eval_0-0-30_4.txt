Enzyme has not yet released an official adapter for React 17, but you can use the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package as a community-supported adapter.

To use it, you need to install the package:

```
npm install --save-dev @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can update your import code to:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

This should allow you to use Enzyme with React 17.
