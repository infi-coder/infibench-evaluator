It seems like you are trying to fetch data from a GraphQL API endpoint that is not available. The `uri` you are using in your `ApolloClient` configuration is `https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io`, which is a demo endpoint provided by Apollo Client documentation. 

You should replace this with the actual endpoint of your GraphQL API. Make sure that the endpoint is correct and accessible from your React Native app. You can test the endpoint using a tool like GraphiQL or GraphQL Playground.

Also, make sure that you have the necessary permissions to access the endpoint. If the endpoint requires authentication, you need to provide the necessary credentials in the `headers` option of the `ApolloClient` configuration.

Once you have updated the `uri` to the correct endpoint, try running your app again and see if the data is fetched successfully.
