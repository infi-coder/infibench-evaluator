The error message "419 Page Expired" usually occurs when the CSRF token expires. The CSRF token is a security feature in Laravel that helps prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. 

To avoid this error message, you can try the following solutions:

1. Increase the session lifetime: You can increase the session lifetime in the `config/session.php` file. By default, the session lifetime is set to 120 minutes. You can increase it to a higher value to avoid the session from expiring too soon.

2. Use AJAX for logout: Instead of using a regular link or button for logout, you can use AJAX to send a logout request to the server. This way, the CSRF token will be refreshed automatically, and you won't get the "419 Page Expired" error message.

3. Use a middleware to refresh the CSRF token: You can create a middleware that refreshes the CSRF token on every request. This way, the token will never expire, and you won't get the error message.

Here's an example of how to create a middleware to refresh the CSRF token:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;

class RefreshCsrfToken
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $response = $next($request);

        if ($response->getStatusCode() === 419) {
            return redirect()->back()->withInput()->withErrors(['csrf_token' => 'CSRF token expired. Please try again.']);
        }

        return $response->header('X-CSRF-Token', csrf_token());
    }
}
```

Then, add the middleware to the `$middleware` array in the `app/Http/Kernel.php` file:

```php
protected $middleware = [
    // ...
    \App\Http\Middleware\RefreshCsrfToken::class,
];
```

With this middleware, the CSRF token will be refreshed on every request, and you won't get the "419 Page Expired" error message.
