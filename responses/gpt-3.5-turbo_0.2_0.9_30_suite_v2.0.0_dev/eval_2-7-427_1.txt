For the first question regarding the CSRF token mismatch error, it seems like the issue could be related to the session configuration on the host domain. You mentioned that multiple sessions are being generated for one user, which could be causing the CSRF token to not match. One possible solution is to check if the session driver on the host domain is set to the same as the one used locally. If not, try changing it to the same driver used locally and see if that resolves the issue.

For the second question regarding the SMTP server error, it seems like the issue could be related to the SSL encryption. The error message indicates that the SSL version number is incorrect. One possible solution is to try changing the encryption type to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' in both the .env file and the mail.php configuration file. Additionally, you may want to check if the SMTP server requires a specific SSL version or if there are any other SSL-related settings that need to be configured.
