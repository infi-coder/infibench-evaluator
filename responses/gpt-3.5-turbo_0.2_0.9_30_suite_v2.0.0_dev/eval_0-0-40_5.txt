The error message you received indicates that there is a problem with the npm executable file. It seems like the file has Windows line endings, which is causing the issue. You can fix this by converting the line endings to Unix format.

You can use the `dos2unix` command to convert the line endings. First, you need to install it using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install dos2unix
```

Once it's installed, you can use it to convert the npm executable file:

```
sudo dos2unix /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm
```

After that, try running `npm -v` again and it should work without any issues.
