The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the `zip` extension is already installed on your server by running the following command in your terminal:
```
php -m | grep zip
```
If the `zip` extension is already installed, you should see `zip` in the output.

2. If the `zip` extension is not installed, you need to install it. The installation process depends on your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it by running the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```
On CentOS, you can install it by running the following command:
```
sudo yum install php-zip
```

3. Once the `zip` extension is installed, restart your web server to apply the changes.

After completing these steps, you should be able to use the `zip` extension in your PHP code without any issues.
