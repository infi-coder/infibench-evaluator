You can use the `--output` parameter to specify the output format as `text` and then pipe the output to `/dev/null` to discard it. This will prevent the interactive pager from popping up and allow the `for` loop to continue to the next iteration. Here's an example of the modified script:

```
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo --output text > /dev/null; 
done
```

This will redirect the output to `/dev/null` which is a special file that discards all data written to it.
