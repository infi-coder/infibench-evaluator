Laravel 9 is not yet released. The latest stable version of Laravel is 8.x. You can create a new Laravel 8 project by running the following command:

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog
```

This will create a new Laravel 8 project in a directory named "blog". If you want to specify a specific version of Laravel 8, you can add the version number after "laravel/laravel". For example, to create a project with Laravel 8.6.0, you can run:

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog "8.6.*"
```

I hope this helps!
