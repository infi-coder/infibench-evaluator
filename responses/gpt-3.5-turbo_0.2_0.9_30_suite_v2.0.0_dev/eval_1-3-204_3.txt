The issue with your code is that the `rename()` method does not have a `columns` parameter. Instead, you can pass a dictionary to the `columns` parameter of the `groupby()` method to rename the "p" column to "mean". Here's the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
    avg = df.groupby("t", sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index().rename(columns={"p": "mean"})
    return avg
```

In this code, we first create a Pandas DataFrame `df` with the given column names. Then we group the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column. We then reset the index of the resulting DataFrame and rename the "p" column to "mean". Finally, we return the resulting DataFrame.
