As of Enzyme version 3.11.0, there is a new adapter available for React 17 called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. You can install it by running:

```
npm install --save-dev @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can update your import code to:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

This should make Enzyme work with your React 17 app.
