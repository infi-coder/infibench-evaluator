- Pressable and TouchableOpacity have the same basic functionalities. They both are for making a text/image clickable.

- Pressable has some new props, like `android_ripple` which you can use to define how far a touch can register away from the the wrapped element.

- On the other hand, TouchableOpacity also have some unique functionalities. For example, TouchableOpacity has automatic opacity change, where with Pressable you need to add your own custom opacity change with Pressable's `style` prop. Furthermore, TouchableOpacity adds the fade-out animation on press. 

In general, if you need a simple clickable component, either Pressable or TouchableOpacity will work. However, if you need more customization options or want to add specific animations, you may want to choose one over the other. Additionally, if you are building for Android specifically, you may want to consider using Pressable for its `android_ripple` prop.
