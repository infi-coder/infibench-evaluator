You can use `grep` with a regular expression to match the language code pattern. Here's an updated command that should work for both cases:

```
curl -Ls yahoo.com | grep -oP 'lang="\K[^"]+' | head -1
```

This command uses the `-o` option to output only the matched text, and the `-P` option to enable Perl-compatible regular expressions. The regular expression `lang="\K[^"]+` matches the `lang="` string and then uses `\K` to reset the match, so that only the language code is captured. The `[^"]+` pattern matches one or more characters that are not double quotes, which should include the language code.

Note that this command assumes that the language code is always enclosed in double quotes after the `lang=` attribute. If the HTML syntax changes, this command may need to be updated accordingly.
