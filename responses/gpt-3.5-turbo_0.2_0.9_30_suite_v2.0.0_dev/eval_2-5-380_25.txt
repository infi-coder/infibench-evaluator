In addition to adding the `springdoc-openapi-ui` dependency, you also need to configure Spring Boot to use it.

You can do this by adding the `@EnableSwagger2WebMvc` annotation to your Spring Boot application class. This annotation enables Swagger support for Spring MVC web applications.

Here's an example:

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import springfox.documentation.swagger2.annotations.EnableSwagger2;

@Configuration
@EnableSwagger2
public class SwaggerConfig {

}
```

Make sure to replace `SwaggerConfig` with the name of your configuration class.

Also, make sure that your application is running on port 8080. If it's running on a different port, you'll need to update the URL accordingly.
