Yes, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to retrieve the description of a Windows service. Here's an example:

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description | Out-GridView
```

This will display a grid view with the name, display name, and description of each Windows service on the system. You can also filter the results to a specific service by adding a `Where-Object` clause, like this:

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "MyService"} | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description
```

This will display the name, display name, and description of the service named "MyService".
