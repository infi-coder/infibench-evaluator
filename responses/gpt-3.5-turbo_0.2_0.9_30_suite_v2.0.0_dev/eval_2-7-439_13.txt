The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed by running the following command in your terminal:
```
php -m | grep zip
```
If the output shows `zip`, then the extension is already installed.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The installation process varies depending on your operating system. Here are some examples:

- For Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

- For CentOS/RHEL:
```
sudo yum install php-zip
```

- For macOS (using Homebrew):
```
brew install php-zip
```

3. After installing the extension, restart your web server to apply the changes.

Once the extension is installed, you should be able to use it in your PHP code without any issues.
