As of Enzyme version 3.11.0, there is no official adapter for React 17 yet. However, you can use the adapter for React 16 with React 17 without any issues.

Here is the adapted code snippet:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Note that you need to install the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package instead of `enzyme-adapter-react-16`.
