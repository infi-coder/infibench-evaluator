It seems like you have created the `.d.ts` file in the wrong location. Instead of creating it at the root level, you should create it inside the `assets` folder. Here's how you can fix it:

1. Move the `index.d.ts` file from the root level to the `assets` folder.

2. Inside `index.d.ts`, add the following code:

```typescript
declare module '*.jpg' {
  const value: any;
  export default value;
}
```

This code tells TypeScript that any file with a `.jpg` extension should be treated as a module, and that the default export of that module is of type `any`.

3. Update `tsconfig.json` to include the `assets` folder in the `include` array:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
  },
  "include": [
    "src",
    "src/assets"
  ]
}
```

4. Finally, update your import statement in `App.tsx` to use the `require` function instead of the `import` statement:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';

const Box = props => {
  const img = require('../assets/image.jpg');
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```

This should fix the error and allow you to import the image in your React component. Note that you can still use the `import` statement if you configure Parcel to handle image imports, but that's outside the scope of this answer.
