The error you are encountering may be due to compatibility issues between the Selenium VBA library and Excel 2019. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium VBA library installed. You can download it from the SeleniumBasic GitHub page.

2. Check that the reference to the Selenium Type Library is properly set. To do this, go to the VBA editor and select Tools > References. Look for the Selenium Type Library and make sure it is checked.

3. Try running the code in a different browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, to see if the issue is specific to Internet Explorer.

4. If none of the above steps work, try running the code on a different machine with Excel 2019 to see if the issue is specific to your machine.

5. If the issue persists, you may need to consider using a different automation tool or contacting the Selenium VBA library developers for further assistance.
