You can try using the `tz_localize` method to set the timezone to None. Here's an example:

```python
import pandas as pd

def removeTimezone(df):
    df['time'] = df['time'].dt.tz_localize(None)
    return df
```

This function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and removes the timezone from the "time" column using the `tz_localize` method. You can call this function before saving the DataFrame to Excel to avoid the `ValueError` you are encountering.
