You can use the `Application.SharePointDocumentLibrary` property to get the URL of the SharePoint document library where the file is stored. Then, you can use the `Microsoft.SharePoint.Client` library to interact with the SharePoint site and create folders and files. Here's an example code snippet:

```
Sub CreateFolderAndFile()
    Dim docLibUrl As String
    Dim folderName As String
    Dim fileName As String
    
    ' Get the SharePoint document library URL
    docLibUrl = Application.SharePointDocumentLibrary
    
    ' Create a folder in the document library
    folderName = "New Folder"
    CreateFolderInSharePoint docLibUrl, folderName
    
    ' Create a file in the folder
    fileName = "New File.txt"
    CreateFileInSharePoint docLibUrl & "/" & folderName, fileName
End Sub

Sub CreateFolderInSharePoint(docLibUrl As String, folderName As String)
    Dim ctx As New SP.ClientContext(docLibUrl)
    Dim web As SP.Web = ctx.Web
    Dim list As SP.List = web.Lists.GetByTitle("Documents")
    Dim folderCreateInfo As New SP.FolderCreationInformation
    folderCreateInfo.UnderlyingObjectType = SP.FileSystemObjectType.Folder
    folderCreateInfo.LeafName = folderName
    Dim newFolder As SP.Folder = list.RootFolder.Folders.Add(folderCreateInfo)
    ctx.ExecuteQuery()
End Sub

Sub CreateFileInSharePoint(folderUrl As String, fileName As String)
    Dim ctx As New SP.ClientContext(folderUrl)
    Dim web As SP.Web = ctx.Web
    Dim folder As SP.Folder = web.GetFolderByServerRelativeUrl(folderUrl)
    Dim fileCreateInfo As New SP.FileCreationInformation
    fileCreateInfo.Content = New Byte() {}
    fileCreateInfo.Url = fileName
    fileCreateInfo.Overwrite = True
    Dim newFile As SP.File = folder.Files.Add(fileCreateInfo)
    ctx.ExecuteQuery()
End Sub
```

Note that you'll need to add a reference to the `Microsoft.SharePoint.Client` library in your VBA project. Also, you'll need to replace "Documents" with the actual name of the document library in your SharePoint site.
