The Rule of 5 is not outdated and is still relevant today. While it is true that implicit constructors and destructors work fine for aggregate data structures, there are cases where user-defined constructors and destructors are necessary.

For example, if a class manages a resource that cannot be handled by a smart pointer, such as a file handle or a network socket, then a user-defined destructor is necessary to properly release that resource. Similarly, if a class has non-copyable or non-movable members, then a user-defined copy constructor, copy assignment constructor, move constructor, or move assignment constructor may be necessary.

In addition, there may be cases where a user-defined constructor or destructor is necessary to perform additional initialization or cleanup tasks beyond what the default constructor or destructor provides.

While smart pointers can be used to manage resources, they are not always the best solution. For example, if a class needs to manage multiple resources or has complex ownership semantics, then a smart pointer may not be sufficient.

In summary, while the Rule of 5 may not be necessary for all classes, it is still an important guideline to follow when designing classes that manage resources or have non-trivial copy or move semantics.
