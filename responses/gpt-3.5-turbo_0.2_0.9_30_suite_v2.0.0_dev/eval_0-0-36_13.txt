You can use `router.reload()` to trigger a client-side reload in Next.js. Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

export default function Component(){
    const router = useRouter();

    const handleCreateData = async () => {
        // code to create new data
        await createData();
        router.reload();
    }

    // rest of the component code
}
```

In this example, `handleCreateData` is a function that is called when the user creates new data. After the data is created, `router.reload()` is called to trigger a client-side reload of the page.
