You can disable the animation in ViewPager2 by setting the `offscreenPageLimit` to 0. This will prevent ViewPager2 from preloading any pages and will show the new fragment immediately when the tab is clicked. Here's an example:

```
viewPager2.offscreenPageLimit = 0
```

You can also set the `smoothScroll` parameter to false when calling `setCurrentItem` to disable the smooth scrolling animation:

```
viewPager2.setCurrentItem(position, false)
```
