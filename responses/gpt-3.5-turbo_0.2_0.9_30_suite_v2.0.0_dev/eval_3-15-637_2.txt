The issue you are facing could be due to the compatibility of the Selenium WebDriver with Excel 2019. Here are some suggestions that you can try:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium WebDriver installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Check if the Selenium WebDriver reference is correctly added to your Excel VBA project. To do this, go to the VBA editor and click on Tools > References. Look for the Selenium Type Library and make sure it is checked.

3. Try using a different browser driver. For example, if you are currently using the Internet Explorer driver, try using the Chrome driver instead.

4. Try running the code in compatibility mode. To do this, right-click on the Excel shortcut and select Properties. Go to the Compatibility tab and check the box for "Run this program in compatibility mode for" and select the version of Excel that was previously working.

5. If none of the above solutions work, you can try downgrading to Excel 2013 or using a different machine with Excel 2013 installed.

I hope one of these solutions works for you. Let me know if you have any further questions.
