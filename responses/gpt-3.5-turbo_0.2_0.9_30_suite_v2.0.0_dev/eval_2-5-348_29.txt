The error message suggests that there is an issue with the quotes in the command. It seems that the quotes are not properly escaped, which is causing the error.

One solution is to use single quotes instead of double quotes around the command, like this:

```
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "'C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd' -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path='C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar' -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install"
```

This should properly escape the quotes and allow the command to be executed without errors.

Alternatively, you can try running the command directly from the command prompt (without using NetBeans) to see if it works. If it does, then the issue may be with the way NetBeans is executing the command. In that case, you may need to check the NetBeans configuration or seek help from the NetBeans community.
