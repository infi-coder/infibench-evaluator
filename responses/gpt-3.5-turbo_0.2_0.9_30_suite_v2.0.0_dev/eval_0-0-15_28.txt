To mock the `API` class, you need to return a constructor function that creates an object with the mocked methods. Here's the revised code that should eliminate the error:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  // Returns a constructor function
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {
      someMethod: () => {}
    };
  });
});

// Now you can create a new instance of the mocked API class
const api = new API();
```

This code creates a mock implementation of the `API` class that returns an object with the `someMethod` method. The `jest.fn()` function creates a mock function that can be used as a constructor, and the `mockImplementation()` method sets the implementation of the constructor function to return the mocked object. Finally, you can create a new instance of the mocked `API` class by calling `new API()`.
