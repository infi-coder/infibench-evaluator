You can add your existing SSH key to Git Bash by following these steps:

1. Open Git Bash and navigate to your home directory by typing `cd ~` and pressing Enter.
2. Create a new directory called `.ssh` by typing `mkdir .ssh` and pressing Enter.
3. Copy your SSH key file from `D:/keys` to the `.ssh` directory by typing `cp D:/keys/id_rsa .ssh/` and pressing Enter. Replace `id_rsa` with the name of your SSH key file if it's different.
4. Set the correct permissions for your SSH key file by typing `chmod 600 .ssh/id_rsa` and pressing Enter.
5. Test your SSH connection by typing `ssh -T git@github.com` (replace `github.com` with the hostname of your Git server) and pressing Enter. If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message that says "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access."

That's it! You should now be able to clone repositories using SSH from your Git Bash.
