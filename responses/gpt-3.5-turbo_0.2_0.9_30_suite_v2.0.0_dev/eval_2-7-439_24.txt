The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server separately.

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -m | grep zip
   ```

   If the extension is already installed, you should see `zip` in the list of installed modules.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The process for installing the extension varies depending on your operating system and the web server you are using. Here are some examples:

   - For Ubuntu, you can install the extension by running the following command:

     ```
     sudo apt-get install php-zip
     ```

   - For CentOS, you can install the extension by running the following command:

     ```
     sudo yum install php-zip
     ```

   - For XAMPP on Windows, you can enable the extension by uncommenting the following line in your `php.ini` file:

     ```
     ;extension=php_zip.dll
     ```

     Change it to:

     ```
     extension=php_zip.dll
     ```

3. After installing the extension, restart your web server to apply the changes.

Once the `ext-zip` extension is installed and enabled, you should be able to use it in your PHP code without any issues.
