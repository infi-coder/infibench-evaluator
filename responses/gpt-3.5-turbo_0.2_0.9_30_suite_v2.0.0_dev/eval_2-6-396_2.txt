The error is caused by the fact that you are trying to create an index on the `Gender` property of the `User` entity, which is not allowed because it is already configured as a navigation property.

To solve this problem, you can remove the following line from your `OnModelCreating` method:
```c#
user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);
```

This will remove the index on the `Gender` property and allow you to create the migration without any errors.

Alternatively, if you want to keep the index on the `Gender` property, you can rename the navigation property to something else, like `UserGender`, and update the `HasOne` and `WithMany` methods accordingly:
```c#
public class User
{
    [Key, Required]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int GenderId { get; set; }
    public virtual Gender UserGender { get; set; }
}

protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.UserGender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);
    }

    user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
}
```

This will allow you to keep the index on the `GenderId` property while still maintaining the relationship between `User` and `Gender`.
