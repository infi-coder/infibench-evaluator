To write a list of lists into an Excel file, we can use the `openpyxl` library in Python. Here's the implementation of the `writeExcel()` function:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeExcel():
    # Create a new workbook
    workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()

    # Select the active worksheet
    worksheet = workbook.active

    # Define the list of lists
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

    # Write the list of lists to the worksheet
    for row in new_list:
        worksheet.append(row)

    # Save the workbook
    workbook.save(filename="data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new Excel workbook, selects the active worksheet, writes the list of lists to the worksheet, and saves the workbook as "data.xlsx". You can call this function to create the Excel file and write the contents to it.
