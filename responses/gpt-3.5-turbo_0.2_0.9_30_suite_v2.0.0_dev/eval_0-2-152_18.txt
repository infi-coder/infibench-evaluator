You need to use the `toast` method provided by Bootstrap to show the toast. Here's an example of how you can show the toast using JavaScript:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast with the default settings. If you want to customize the toast, you can pass an object with the options to the `toast` method. For example:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast({
  delay: 2000 // show the toast for 2 seconds
}).toast('show');
```

Make sure that you have included the necessary Bootstrap JavaScript and CSS files in your HTML file.
