Your `sed` command is not correctly removing the question mark and everything after it. Try using the following command instead:
```
find . -type f -name '*\?*' -exec sh -c 'mv "$1" "${1%\?*}"' _ {} \;
```
This uses parameter expansion to remove the question mark and everything after it from the filename. The `sh -c` command allows us to use the parameter expansion within the `mv` command.
