This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, a popular Rust language server. It is a false positive and does not indicate any actual issues with your code. 

You can try updating rust-analyzer to the latest version, as this bug may have been fixed in a more recent release. Alternatively, you can ignore the error and continue working on your code, as it should not affect the functionality of your program or your ability to compile and run it.
