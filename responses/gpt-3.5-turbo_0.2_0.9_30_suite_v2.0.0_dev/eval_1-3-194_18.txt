To write a list of lists into an Excel file, we can use the `openpyxl` module. Here's the `writeExcel()` function that creates an Excel file named "data.xlsx" and writes the given list of lists into the first sheet of the file:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeExcel(data):
    # Create a new workbook
    workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()

    # Select the active worksheet
    worksheet = workbook.active

    # Write the data to the worksheet
    for row in data:
        worksheet.append(row)

    # Save the workbook
    workbook.save("data.xlsx")
```

You can call this function with the list of lists you want to write to the Excel file:

```python
new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
writeExcel(new_list)
```

This will create an Excel file named "data.xlsx" in the current directory and write the contents of `new_list` into the first sheet of the file.
