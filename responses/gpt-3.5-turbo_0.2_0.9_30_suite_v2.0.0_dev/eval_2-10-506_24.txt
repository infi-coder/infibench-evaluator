You can use the `iter()` method to create an iterator over the vector and then use the `min()` method to get the minimum value. Here's an example:

```rust
let v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
let min_value = *v.iter().min().unwrap();
println!("The minimum value is {}", min_value);
```

In this example, `v.iter()` creates an iterator over the vector `v`, and `min()` returns an `Option<&i32>` that represents the minimum value. Since we know that the vector is not empty, we can safely call `unwrap()` to get the minimum value as an `i32`. Finally, we use the `*` operator to dereference the value and get the actual `i32` value.
