The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

```bash
pip install zlib
```

If that doesn't work, you can try installing Pillow using pre-built binaries instead of building from source. You can download the appropriate version of Pillow from the official website (https://python-pillow.org/) and install it using pip:

```bash
pip install <path-to-downloaded-file>
```

Alternatively, you can try installing Pillow using conda:

```bash
conda install pillow
```

Make sure to activate your virtual environment before running any of these commands.
