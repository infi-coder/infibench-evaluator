The issue with your code is that the `rename()` method is used to rename the index or column labels of a DataFrame. In your case, you want to rename a specific column of the DataFrame. To do this, you can simply assign a new name to the column using the `rename()` method with the `columns` parameter.

Here's the modified code that should work for you:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index(name="mean")
    return avg
```

In this code, we first create a DataFrame `df` with the given column names. Then we group the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column. We use the `reset_index()` method to convert the grouped column "t" to a regular column and rename the "p" column to "mean" using the `name` parameter.

Finally, we return the modified DataFrame `avg`.
