Your `sed` command is not correctly removing the `?` and everything after it. Instead of using `.*`, which matches any character, you should use `[^?]*`, which matches any character except `?`. So your command should be:
```
find . -type f -name '*\?*' -exec sh -c 'mv "$1" "${1/\?[^?]*}"' sh {} \;
```
This should correctly remove the `?` and everything after it from all file names that contain a `?`.
