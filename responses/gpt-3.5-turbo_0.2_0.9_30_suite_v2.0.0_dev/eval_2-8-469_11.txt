You need to add a `go_package` option to your proto file. The `go_package` option specifies the Go package name for the generated code. 

For example, if you want the generated code to be in the `main` package, you can add the following line to your proto file:

```go
option go_package = "main";
```

Your updated proto file should look like this:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "main";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

After making this change, you can run the same `protoc` command to generate the Go code:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. simple.proto
``` 

This should generate a `simple.pb.go` file in the current directory.
