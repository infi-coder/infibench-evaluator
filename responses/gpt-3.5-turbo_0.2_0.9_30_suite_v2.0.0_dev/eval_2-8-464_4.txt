The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is because the executable file was built on a Windows platform and is not compatible with the Linux environment in which AWS Lambda runs.

To resolve this issue, you need to build the executable file on a Linux environment or use a cross-compiler to build the executable file for Linux.

One way to build the executable file for Linux is to use a Docker container that simulates the Linux environment. Here are the steps to build the executable file using Docker:

1. Install Docker on your Windows machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory that contains your Go code.
3. Run the following command to build the executable file using Docker:

   ```
   docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp golang:1.16 go build -o main main.go
   ```

   This command mounts the current directory (`$PWD`) as a volume in the Docker container and sets the working directory to the mounted directory. It then runs the `go build` command to build the executable file `main` in the current directory.

4. Zip the `main` executable file and upload it to AWS Lambda.

After following these steps, your Lambda function should be able to find and execute the `main` executable file without any issues.
