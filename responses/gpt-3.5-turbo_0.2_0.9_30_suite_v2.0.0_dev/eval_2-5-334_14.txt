@Configuration should be used when you need to define beans that require additional configuration beyond what is provided by the other annotations. For example, if you need to configure a third-party library or set up a complex dependency injection scenario, you would use @Configuration. @Service, @Controller, and @Component are used to define beans that provide specific functionality within your application.
