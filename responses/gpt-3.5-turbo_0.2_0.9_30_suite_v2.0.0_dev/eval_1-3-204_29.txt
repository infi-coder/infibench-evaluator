The `rename()` method in Pandas is used to rename the columns of a DataFrame. However, it does not accept the `columns` parameter. Instead, you can pass a dictionary to the `columns` parameter of the `groupby()` method to rename the column.

Here's the modified code that should work:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index().rename(columns={"p": "mean"})
    return avg
```

In this code, we first group the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column. Then, we reset the index of the resulting DataFrame and rename the "p" column to "mean". Finally, we return the resulting DataFrame.

You can call this function by passing your original DataFrame as an argument:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
renamed_df = renameDataFrame(df)
``` 

This will return a DataFrame with the "p" column renamed as "mean" and the average numbers grouped by the "t" column.
