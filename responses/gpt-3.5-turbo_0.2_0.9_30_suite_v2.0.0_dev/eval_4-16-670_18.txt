Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command in your terminal. Here are the steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your `id_rsa` file is located.
2. Run the following command to convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f id_rsa
   ```

   This command will prompt you to enter the passphrase for your private key. Enter the passphrase and press Enter.
   
   Then, it will ask you to enter the new passphrase. You can either enter a new passphrase or leave it blank to remove the passphrase. Press Enter.
   
   Finally, it will output the converted RSA private key to the terminal. You can copy and paste it to a new file and save it as `id_rsa_rsa`.

3. You don't need to transfer your `id_rsa.pub` file as it is just the public key that corresponds to your private key. The server administrator should already have your public key on the server. However, if you want to be sure, you can run the following command to display your public key in the correct format:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -f id_rsa.pub -e -m PKCS8
   ```

   This command will output your public key in the PKCS8 format, which is the format that the server administrator needs. You can copy and paste the output and send it to the server administrator.
