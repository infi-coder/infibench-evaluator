Your `sed` command is not correctly removing the `?` and everything after it. Instead of using `.*`, which matches any character, use `[^?]*`, which matches any character except `?`. So your `sed` command should be:
```
sed 's/\([^?]*\)\?.*/\1/'
```
This will remove the `?` and everything after it. Also, the `mv` command is not working because the source and destination filenames are the same. You can use the `rename` command instead of `mv` to rename the files. Try this command:
```
find . -type f -name '*\?*' -exec rename 's/\([^?]*\)\?.*/\1/' {} \;
``` 
This will remove the `?` and everything after it from all filenames that contain `?`.
