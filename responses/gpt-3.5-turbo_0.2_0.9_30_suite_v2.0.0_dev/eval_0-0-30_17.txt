As of Enzyme version 3.11.0, there is no official adapter for React 17 yet. However, you can use the adapter for React 16 with React 17 without any issues. Here's the code snippet you can use:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Note that you need to install the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package separately from Enzyme. You can do this by running the following command:

```
npm install --save-dev @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Once you have installed the adapter, you can use Enzyme to write your unit tests as usual.
