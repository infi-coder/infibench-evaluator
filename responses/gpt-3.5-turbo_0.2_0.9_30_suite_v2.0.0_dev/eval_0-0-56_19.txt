It seems like the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite only binds to the localhost interface, which means that it can only be accessed from within the container itself.

To fix this, you need to tell Vite to bind to all network interfaces. You can do this by adding the `--host 0.0.0.0` option to the `npm run vite` command inside the Docker container. This will make Vite bind to all network interfaces, which will allow it to be accessed from outside the container.

So, your command to start the Vite server inside the Docker container should look like this:

```
npm run vite -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

This should allow you to access the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.
