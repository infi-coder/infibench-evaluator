The `FormatException` is thrown when the JSON string you are trying to decode is not in the expected format. In your case, it seems that the response from the PHP file is not a valid JSON string.

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the response from the PHP file by printing it to the console. You can use `print(response.body)` to print the response.

2. Verify that the response is a valid JSON string. You can use an online JSON validator like https://jsonlint.com/ to check the validity of the JSON string.

3. If the response is not a valid JSON string, you need to fix the PHP file to return a valid JSON response.

4. If the response is a valid JSON string, you can try to decode it using the `json.decode()` method. Make sure that the response is not null before decoding it.

Here is an updated version of your code that includes error handling:

```dart
Future<String> iniciarSesion() async{
  var usuario = textUsuario.text;
  var password = textPassword.text;
  var nombreUsuario;
  var url ="http://192.168.1.37/usuario.php";

  //Metodo post
  var response = await http.post(
      url,
      headers:{ "Accept": "application/json" } ,
      body: { "usuario": '$usuario',"password": '$password'},
      encoding: Encoding.getByName("utf-8")
  );

  if (response.statusCode != 200) {
    throw Exception('Failed to load data');
  }

  var jsonResponse = json.decode(response.body);
  if (jsonResponse == null) {
    throw Exception('Invalid JSON format');
  }

  List data = jsonResponse;
}
```

This code checks the status code of the response and throws an exception if it is not 200. It then tries to decode the JSON response and throws an exception if the JSON is invalid.
