In your `if` statement, you are using single quotes around `$searchT`, which means that the variable will not be expanded. To expand the variable, you can use double quotes instead. Here's the corrected code:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" && wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

With this change, the script should now correctly match the search term and run the `if` statement if there is a match.
