The issue with your code is that you are missing a comma after the color value of the "primary" key in the `$theme-colors` map. Here's the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here,
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace `#your-color-here` with the desired color value. After making this change, the SCSS should compile without any errors.
