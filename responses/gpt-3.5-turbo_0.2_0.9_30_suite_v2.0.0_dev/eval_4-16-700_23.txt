You can use awk to achieve the same result more efficiently. Here's an example command:

```
awk -F= '/name/ {name=$2} /value/ && name {print name "=" $2; name=""}' input.txt > output.txt
```

This command sets the field separator to "=" and then looks for lines containing "name" and "value". If a line contains "name", it saves the name value. If a line contains "value" and a name value has been saved, it prints the name and value separated by "=" and resets the name value. This should be much faster than your current solution.
