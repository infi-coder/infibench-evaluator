Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Type the following command to convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   This command will prompt you to enter a passphrase for your private key. If you don't want to use a passphrase, just press Enter.

3. After you enter the passphrase (or press Enter), the command will convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key and save it to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

4. You can now use the new RSA private key to connect to the server.

5. You don't need to transfer your `id_rsa.pub` file, as it is just the public key that corresponds to your private key. The server administrator should already have your public key on the server.
