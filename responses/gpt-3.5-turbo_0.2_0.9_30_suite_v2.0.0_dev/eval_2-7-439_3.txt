The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the `zip` extension is already installed on your server by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -m | grep zip
   ```

   If the `zip` extension is already installed, you should see it in the output. If not, you need to install it.

2. Install the `zip` extension on your server. The installation process depends on your server's operating system and PHP version. Here are some examples:

   - Ubuntu with PHP 7.4:

     ```
     sudo apt-get install php7.4-zip
     ```

   - CentOS with PHP 7.4:

     ```
     sudo yum install php74-php-zip
     ```

   - macOS with PHP 7.4 (using Homebrew):

     ```
     brew install php@7.4
     brew install php@7.4-zip
     ```

3. After installing the `zip` extension, restart your web server or PHP-FPM service to apply the changes.

   - Ubuntu with Apache:

     ```
     sudo systemctl restart apache2
     ```

   - CentOS with Apache:

     ```
     sudo systemctl restart httpd
     ```

   - Ubuntu with Nginx and PHP-FPM:

     ```
     sudo systemctl restart php7.4-fpm
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```

   - CentOS with Nginx and PHP-FPM:

     ```
     sudo systemctl restart php74-php-fpm
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```

After installing the `zip` extension on your server, you should be able to use it in your PHP code without any issues.
