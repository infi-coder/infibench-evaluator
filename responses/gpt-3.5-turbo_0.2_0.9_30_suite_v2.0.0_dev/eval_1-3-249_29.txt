Sure, here's a possible implementation of the `generateRandomString` function in Python:

```python
import random
import string

def generateRandomString():
    # Define the possible characters for the code
    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    
    # Generate a random code that contains "NAA3U" and 3 digits
    while True:
        code = "NAA3U" + ''.join(random.choices(chars, k=11))
        digits = [c for c in code if c.isdigit()]
        if len(digits) == 3:
            return code
```

This function uses the `random` and `string` modules to generate a random code that meets the requirements. It first defines the possible characters for the code as all the letters (lowercase and uppercase) and digits. Then, it enters a loop that generates a random code and checks if it contains "NAA3U" and exactly 3 digits. If it does, the function returns the code. If it doesn't, the loop continues until a valid code is found.

You can call this function multiple times to generate different random codes that meet your requirements.
