This error occurs because IntelliJ IDEA is using an older version of Maven than the one used to generate the project. To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Go to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.
3. Check the "Use Maven from" option and select the Maven installation that matches the version used to generate the project.
4. Click "OK" to save the changes.
5. Re-import the Maven project by going to View > Tool Windows > Maven > Reimport.

If the above steps do not work, you can try updating the Maven version used by IntelliJ IDEA. To do this, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of Maven from the official website.
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a directory on your computer.
3. Open IntelliJ IDEA and go to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.
4. Click the "+" button to add a new Maven installation.
5. Set the "Maven home directory" to the directory where you extracted the Maven archive.
6. Click "OK" to save the changes.
7. Go back to step 3 of the previous solution and select the newly added Maven installation.

If none of the above solutions work, you can try deleting the IntelliJ IDEA system directory and restarting the IDE. To do this, you can follow these steps:

1. Close IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Delete the system directory for IntelliJ IDEA. The location of this directory varies depending on your operating system. You can find the location of this directory in the IntelliJ IDEA documentation.
3. Restart IntelliJ IDEA and re-import the Maven project.
