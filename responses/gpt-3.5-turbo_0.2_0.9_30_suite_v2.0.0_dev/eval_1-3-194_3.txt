To write a list of lists into an Excel file, we can use the `openpyxl` library. Here's the code for the `writeToExcel` function:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeToExcel():
    # create a new workbook
    wb = openpyxl.Workbook()

    # select the active worksheet
    ws = wb.active

    # write the data to the worksheet
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    for row in new_list:
        ws.append(row)

    # save the workbook
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new workbook, selects the active worksheet, writes the data to the worksheet row by row, and saves the workbook as "data.xlsx". You can call this function to create the Excel file and write the data to it.
