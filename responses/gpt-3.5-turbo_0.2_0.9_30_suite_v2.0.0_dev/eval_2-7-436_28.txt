The error message suggests that your current PHP version or extensions may not be compatible with Laravel 9. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. Check your PHP version: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   php -v
   ```

   If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

2. Check your PHP extensions: Laravel 9 requires some PHP extensions that may not be installed by default. You can check which extensions are required by running the following command:

   ```bash
   composer show laravel/laravel --requires
   ```

   Make sure that all the required extensions are installed and enabled in your PHP configuration.

3. Check your Composer version: Laravel 9 requires Composer 2.0 or higher. You can check your Composer version by running the following command:

   ```bash
   composer -v
   ```

   If your Composer version is lower than 2.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

Once you've made sure that your PHP version, extensions, and Composer version are compatible with Laravel 9, try running the `composer create-project` command again.
