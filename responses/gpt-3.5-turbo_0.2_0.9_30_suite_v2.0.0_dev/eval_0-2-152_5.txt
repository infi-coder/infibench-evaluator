To show the toast, you need to call the `toast()` method on the `.toast` element. Here's how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast with the default settings. If you want to customize the toast, you can pass an options object to the `toast()` method. For example:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast({
  delay: 2000 // show the toast for 2 seconds
}).toast('show');
```

This will show the toast for 2 seconds before hiding it. You can find more information about customizing the toast in the Bootstrap documentation.
