To enable Developer Mode on iOS 16.0, follow these steps:

1. Open the Settings app on your iOS device.
2. Scroll down and tap on "Developer".
3. Toggle the switch next to "Developer Mode" to the on position.
4. If prompted, enter your device passcode to confirm the action.
5. Once enabled, you should be able to run the provisioned testing build without any issues.

Note: If you do not see the "Developer" option in your Settings app, it means that Developer Mode is not available on your device. This is typically the case for non-jailbroken devices.
