It seems like the issue is with the `uri` you are using in your `ApolloClient`. The `uri` you are using is for a demo server provided by Apollo, which may not be working properly at the moment.

You should replace the `uri` with the endpoint of your GraphQL server. You can check if your GraphQL server is working properly by using a tool like GraphiQL or GraphQL Playground.

If you don't have a GraphQL server set up yet, you can follow the instructions in the Apollo Client documentation to set up a simple server using Apollo Server and GraphQL. Once you have your server running, you can use its endpoint as the `uri` in your `ApolloClient`.

Also, make sure that your device or emulator has internet connectivity.
