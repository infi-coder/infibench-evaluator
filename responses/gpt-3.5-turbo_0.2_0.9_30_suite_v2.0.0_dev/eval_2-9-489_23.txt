This warning is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled. Without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone. 

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch security. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` located in the `config` directory of your Elasticsearch installation.

2. Uncomment the following lines:
```
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

4. If you're using Searchkick, you may need to update your Searchkick configuration to include the Elasticsearch username and password. Here's an example:
```
Searchkick.client_options = {
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"],
  transport_options: {
    request: { timeout: 5 },
    headers: { "Content-Type" => "application/json" },
    ssl: { verify: false }
  },
  user: "elastic",
  password: "changeme"
}
```

Note that the default Elasticsearch username is `elastic` and the default password is `changeme`. You should change the password to something more secure.

After following these steps, the warning should disappear and your Elasticsearch cluster will be more secure.
