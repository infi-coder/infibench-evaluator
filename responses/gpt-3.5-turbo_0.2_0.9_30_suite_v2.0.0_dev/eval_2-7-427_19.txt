For the first question, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server's clock is not synchronized with the client's clock, causing the token to expire before it should. Another possibility is that the session is not being properly maintained between requests, causing the token to be lost. You can try increasing the SESSION_LIFETIME to see if that helps. Additionally, you can check if the server has any security modules or firewalls that could be interfering with the session management.

For the second question, the error "SSL operation failed with code 1. OpenSSL Error messages: error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number" suggests that the server is expecting a different SSL version than what is being used by the client. You can try changing the MAIL_ENCRYPTION to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' as it is more commonly used. Additionally, you can try changing the MAIL_PORT to 465 as it is the default port for SSL/TLS encrypted connections. If that doesn't work, you can try contacting the email provider to see if they have any specific requirements for connecting to their SMTP server.
