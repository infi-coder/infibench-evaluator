For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server's clock is not in sync with the client's clock, causing the token to expire before it should. Another possibility is that there is a caching issue on the server that is causing old tokens to be used instead of new ones. You can try clearing the cache on the server to see if that resolves the issue.

For the second issue, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used by the server is not compatible with the version being used by the client. You can try changing the encryption method in your .env file to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' and see if that resolves the issue. If not, you may need to contact the email provider to see if they can provide any guidance on the correct encryption method to use.
