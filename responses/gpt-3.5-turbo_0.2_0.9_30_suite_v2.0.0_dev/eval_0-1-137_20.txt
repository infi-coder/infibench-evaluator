The issue with your code is that you are missing a comma after the color value of the "primary" key in the `$theme-colors` map. Here's the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here,
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace `#your-color-here` with the actual color value you want to use.

Also, make sure that you have installed the required dependencies for compiling SASS. You can install them using the following command:

```
npm install sass --save-dev
```

After installing the dependencies, you can compile your SCSS file using the following command:

```
sass style.scss custom.css
```

This will compile your SCSS file and generate a CSS file named `custom.css`.
