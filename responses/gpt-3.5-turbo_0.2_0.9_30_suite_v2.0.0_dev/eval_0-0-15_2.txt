To mock the `API` class and eliminate the `TypeError`, you can use the `jest.fn()` method to create a mock implementation of the class constructor and its methods. Here's an example:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {
      someMethod: jest.fn()
    };
  });
});

// Now you can create a new instance of the mocked API class
const api = new API();

// You can also call its methods
api.someMethod();
```

In this example, we're using `jest.fn()` to create a mock implementation of the `API` class constructor. We're then returning an object with a `someMethod` method that is also a mock function created with `jest.fn()`. This allows us to test that the `someMethod` method is called correctly without actually executing its implementation.
