The Rule of 5 is not outdated, as it is still relevant in modern C++. While it is true that in many cases, the default constructors and destructors provided by the compiler may be sufficient, there are still situations where user-defined constructors and destructors are necessary.

For example, if a class manages a resource such as memory or a file handle, it may need a user-defined destructor to properly release that resource. Similarly, if a class has non-trivial data members, it may need a user-defined copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, or move assignment operator to properly manage those members.

While it is true that smart pointers can be used to manage resources, they are not always the best solution. In some cases, it may be more appropriate to use a custom class with a user-defined destructor to manage a resource, especially if the resource has complex ownership semantics.

In summary, while the default constructors and destructors provided by the compiler may be sufficient in many cases, there are still situations where user-defined constructors and destructors are necessary, and the Rule of 5 is still a useful guideline to follow.
