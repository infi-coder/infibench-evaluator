The error message suggests that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib first and then installing Pillow again. Here are the steps to install zlib:

1. Download the zlib source code from the official website: https://zlib.net/
2. Extract the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.
3. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted the zlib source code.
4. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   ./configure
   make
   make install
   ```

5. After installing zlib, try installing Pillow again using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```

If the above steps do not work, you can try installing Pillow from a pre-built binary wheel file. You can download the appropriate wheel file for your system from the following website: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pillow

Once you have downloaded the wheel file, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install path/to/wheel/file
```

Replace `path/to/wheel/file` with the actual path to the downloaded wheel file.
