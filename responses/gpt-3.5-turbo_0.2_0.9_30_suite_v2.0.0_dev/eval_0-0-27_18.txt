It seems like the issue might be related to the network configuration of your app. 

The `uri` you are using in your `ApolloClient` configuration is a public endpoint provided by Apollo. It might be possible that the endpoint is down or not responding properly. 

To test if the issue is related to the endpoint, you can try using a different endpoint or a local GraphQL server. You can also try running the endpoint URL in your browser to see if it returns any data.

If the endpoint is not the issue, you can try adding the `networkPolicy` option to your `ApolloClient` configuration to specify the network policy for your queries. For example, you can set it to `NetworkPolicy.cache-and-network` to fetch data from the cache first and then fetch from the network if the data is not available in the cache.

Here is an example of how you can set the `networkPolicy` option:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
    defaultOptions: {
        watchQuery: {
            fetchPolicy: 'cache-and-network',
        },
        query: {
            fetchPolicy: 'cache-and-network',
        },
    },
});
```

I hope this helps!
