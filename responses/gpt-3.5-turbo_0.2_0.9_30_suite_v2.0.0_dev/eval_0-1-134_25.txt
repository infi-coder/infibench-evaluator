It sounds like you might be referring to Emmet, a plugin that allows you to write shorthand code and expand it into full HTML/CSS. 

To use Emmet, you can type out the shorthand code and then press the "Tab" key. For example, if you type `.classname` and then press "Tab", it should expand into `<div class="classname"></div>`. 

If this isn't working for you, make sure that you have the Emmet plugin installed in your code editor and that it is enabled. You can also check the Emmet documentation for more information on how to use it.
