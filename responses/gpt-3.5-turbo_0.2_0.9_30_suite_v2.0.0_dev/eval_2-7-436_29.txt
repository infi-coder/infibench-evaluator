The error message suggests that the version of PHP you have installed on your system is not compatible with Laravel 9. Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher.

You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -v
```

If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you will need to upgrade it to a compatible version. You can download and install the latest version of PHP from the official PHP website.

Once you have upgraded your PHP version, try running the `composer create-project` command again. It should work without any issues.
