The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is because the executable file was built on a Windows platform and is not compatible with the Linux environment in which AWS Lambda runs.

To resolve this issue, you need to build the executable file on a Linux environment or use a cross-compiler to build the executable file that is compatible with the Linux environment.

Here are the steps to build a compatible executable file using a cross-compiler:

1. Install the Go cross-compiler for Linux on your Windows machine. You can download it from the official Go website: https://golang.org/dl/

2. Set the environment variables for the cross-compiler. For example, if you have installed the cross-compiler in the `C:\go-linux` directory, you can set the environment variables as follows:

```
set GOOS=linux
set GOARCH=amd64
set CGO_ENABLED=0
set CC=C:\go-linux\bin\x86_64-linux-musl-gcc.exe
```

3. Build the executable file using the cross-compiler:

```
go build -o main main.go
```

4. Zip the executable file and any other required files:

```
zip main.zip main
```

5. Upload the `main.zip` file to AWS Lambda and test the function.

With these steps, you should be able to build a compatible executable file for AWS Lambda using a cross-compiler on a Windows platform.
