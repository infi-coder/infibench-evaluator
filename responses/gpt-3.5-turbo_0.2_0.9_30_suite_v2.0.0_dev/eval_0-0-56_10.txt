It seems like the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` which means it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0` which will allow it to listen on all network interfaces.

To do this, you can modify the `server.host` option in your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0'
    }
})
```

This will allow the Vite server to be accessed from outside the container.

Additionally, you may need to modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to use the `host` network mode instead of publishing ports:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  app:
    image: myapp
    build: .
    container_name: myapp
    network_mode: host
```

This will allow the container to use the host network interface directly, which should make it easier to access the Vite server from outside the container.

With these changes, you should be able to access the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.
