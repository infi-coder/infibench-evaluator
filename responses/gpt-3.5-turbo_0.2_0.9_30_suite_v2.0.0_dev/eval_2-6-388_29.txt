The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you will not have access to this attribute.

To use the `[Keyless]` attribute, you need to make sure that you are using Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later. You can check the version of Entity Framework Core that you are using by looking at the version number of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package in your project's dependencies.

If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you can still create keyless entities by defining a class with no primary key and using the `HasNoKey` method in your `OnModelCreating` method to configure the entity as keyless. Here's an example:

```c#
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string Property1 { get; set; }
    public int Property2 { get; set; }
}

protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<MyKeylessClass>().HasNoKey();
}
```

Then you can use the `FromSqlRaw` method to query the keyless entity:

```c#
var results = _context.Set<MyKeylessClass>().FromSqlRaw("SELECT Property1, Property2 FROM MyTable").ToList();
```
