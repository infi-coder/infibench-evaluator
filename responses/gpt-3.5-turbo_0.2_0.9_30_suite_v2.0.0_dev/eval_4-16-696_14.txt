Your `sed` command is not correctly removing the `?` and everything after it. Instead of `s/\?.*//g`, try using `s/\?.*$//g`. This should remove the `?` and everything after it. 

Also, the `mv` command is not necessary if you are using the `-exec` option with `find`. You can simply use `rename` command to rename the files. Here's the updated command:

```
find . -type f -name '*\?*' -exec rename 's/\?.*$//' {} \;
``` 

This should remove the `?` and everything after it from all the file names that contain `?`.
