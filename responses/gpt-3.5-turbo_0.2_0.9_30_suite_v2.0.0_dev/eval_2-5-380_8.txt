To use the Swagger UI with Spring Boot, you need to configure it in your application. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Make sure you have the `@EnableSwagger2` annotation in your main Spring Boot application class.

2. Add the `@Configuration` annotation to a new class that extends `WebMvcConfigurationSupport`.

3. Override the `addResourceHandlers` method to add the Swagger UI resources to the classpath.

Here's an example of what your configuration class should look like:

```java
@Configuration
public class SwaggerConfig extends WebMvcConfigurationSupport {

    @Override
    public void addResourceHandlers(ResourceHandlerRegistry registry) {
        registry.addResourceHandler("swagger-ui.html")
                .addResourceLocations("classpath:/META-INF/resources/");

        registry.addResourceHandler("/webjars/**")
                .addResourceLocations("classpath:/META-INF/resources/webjars/");
    }
}
```

Make sure you have the `springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=true` property set in your `application.properties` file.

Also, make sure you have the correct version of the `springdoc-openapi-ui` dependency. You can check the latest version on the Maven Central Repository.

After following these steps, you should be able to access the Swagger UI at `localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.
