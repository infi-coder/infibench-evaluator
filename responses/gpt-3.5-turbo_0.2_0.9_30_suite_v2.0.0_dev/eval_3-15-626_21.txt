You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate a Power Query. Here's an example code snippet:

```
Sub RefreshPowerQuery()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections("Query - SalesData") 'change "Query - SalesData" to the name of your Power Query connection
    conn.Refresh
End Sub
```

You can modify this code to load the results to a specific worksheet by adding a `ListObject` and setting its `SourceType` to `xlSrcQuery`.
