Yes, you can use the `first` and `last` pseudo-class variants in Tailwind to achieve this effect. Here's how you can modify your code:

```html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="(item, index) in items"
    :key="`item-${index}`"
    class="border-solid border-b border-black {{ index === items.length - 1 ? '' : 'pb-4' }}"
  >
    Item
  </li>
</ul>
```

In this code, we're using the `pb-4` class to add a bottom padding to all `li` elements except the last one. We're using a ternary operator to conditionally apply this class based on whether the current `li` element is the last one in the list.

Note that we're also using string interpolation to generate a unique `key` for each `li` element. This is a best practice when using `v-for` in Vue.js.
