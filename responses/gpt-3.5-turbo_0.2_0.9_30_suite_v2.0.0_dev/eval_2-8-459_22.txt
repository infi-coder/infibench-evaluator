It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is present in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is present in the cache, you should see output similar to the following:

   ```
   github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is not present in the cache, you will see an error message.

2. Check if the module is accessible from computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m -versions github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
   ```

   This will list all the available versions of the module. If the module is not accessible, you will see an error message.

3. Check if there are any network issues preventing the module from being downloaded. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go env GONOPROXY GONOSUMDB GOPRIVATE
   ```

   This will show the environment variables that control which modules are excluded from the proxy and checksum database. If the module is excluded, you will need to update these variables to include the module.

4. Check if there are any issues with the authentication credentials. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go env GONOSUMDB GOPRIVATE
   ```

   This will show the environment variables that control which modules are excluded from the checksum database and which modules are considered private. If the module is considered private, you will need to update these variables to include the module.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you identify the issue and resolve it.
