When you set `"sourceMap": false` in `tsconfig.json`, the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your TypeScript code. Source maps are used to map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code, which is useful for debugging purposes.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the generated JavaScript code will not have a corresponding source map file, which means that you will not be able to debug your TypeScript code directly in the browser's developer tools. Instead, you will have to debug the compiled JavaScript code directly.

However, setting `"sourceMap": false` can improve the performance of your application, as generating source maps can be a time-consuming process. It can also reduce the size of your build output, as source map files can be quite large.

In summary, setting `"sourceMap": false` can improve performance and reduce build output size, but it will make debugging more difficult.
