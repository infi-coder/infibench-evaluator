To split the data into separate columns, you can use the `Split` function in VBA. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to split the data and write it to separate columns:

```
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    data = Split(textline, ",")
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = data(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = data(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = data(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = data(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = data(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

In this example, the `Split` function is used to split the `textline` variable into an array called `data`, using the comma as the delimiter. The values in the `data` array are then written to separate columns in the Excel sheet using the `Cells` function.
