Here's a possible implementation of the `to_camel_case` function in Python:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r"[_-]", text)
    return words[0] + "".join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function first checks if the input string is empty, in which case it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it splits the string into words using a regular expression that matches either underscores or dashes as delimiters. It then capitalizes all words except the first one, and concatenates them together to form the camel case string.

You will also need to import the `re` module at the beginning of your code to use the regular expression functions.
