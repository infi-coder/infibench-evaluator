The issue might be related to the compatibility of the Selenium WebDriver with the version of Internet Explorer installed on your machine. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure that the Internet Explorer browser is up-to-date. You can check for updates by going to the "Settings" menu in Internet Explorer and selecting "About Internet Explorer".

2. Try using a different browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, to see if the issue persists. If the code works with a different browser, then the issue might be related to Internet Explorer.

3. Try using a different version of the Selenium WebDriver. You can download different versions of the WebDriver from the Selenium website. Make sure to select the version that is compatible with your version of Excel and the browser you are using.

4. Check if the Selenium add-in is enabled in Excel. You can do this by going to the "File" menu, selecting "Options", and then selecting "Add-ins". Make sure that the Selenium add-in is enabled.

5. Try running the code on a different machine with Excel 2019 installed to see if the issue is specific to your machine.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will help resolve the issue.
