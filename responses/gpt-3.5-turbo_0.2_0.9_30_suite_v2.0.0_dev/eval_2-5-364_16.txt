If you want to use the same version of Java that works with the Maven task, you can specify the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the location of the JDK that Maven is using. 

To do this, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk
```

Replace `/path/to/jdk` with the actual path to the JDK that Maven is using. 

Alternatively, you can add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk
```

This will set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable every time you open a new terminal or command prompt.
