Here's the revised code for the `pig_latin` function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        pig_latin_word = word[1:].lower() + word[0].lower() + "ay"
        pig_latin_words.append(pig_latin_word)
    return " ".join(pig_latin_words)
```

In this revised code, we first split the input text into individual words using the `split()` method. Then, we iterate over each word and create a new pig Latin word by moving the first character to the end, adding "ay" to the end, and converting the entire word to lowercase. We then append this new pig Latin word to a list of pig Latin words.

Finally, we join the list of pig Latin words back into a single string using the `join()` method, with a space as the separator between words. This string is then returned as the output of the function.
