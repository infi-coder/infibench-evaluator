Using @Autowired on the constructor is a recommended approach for dependency injection in Spring. It makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It also ensures that the required dependencies are injected at the time of object creation, making the object ready for use immediately. Additionally, it makes the class immutable, which is a good practice in object-oriented programming. However, if you prefer to use setter injection or field injection, you can still do so in Spring.
