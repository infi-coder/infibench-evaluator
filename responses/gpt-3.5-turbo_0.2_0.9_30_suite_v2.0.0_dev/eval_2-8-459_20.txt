It seems like the go module system is unable to find the required module in the module cache or in any of the configured module proxies. Here are a few things you can try to debug this issue:

1. Check if the required module is present in the module cache on computer B. You can find the module cache location by running `go env GOMODCACHE`. If the module is not present, try running `go get <module>` to download it.

2. Check if the required module is present in any of the configured module proxies. You can find the list of configured proxies by running `go env GONOPROXY GONOSUMDB GOPRIVATE GOPROXY`. If the module is not present, try adding the module to the `GOPRIVATE` environment variable.

3. Check if the required module is accessible from computer B. Try accessing the module URL in a web browser or using `curl`. If you are unable to access the module, it could be a network issue or a permissions issue.

4. Check if the required module has any dependencies that are not present on computer B. You can check the module's `go.mod` file to see its dependencies. If any of the dependencies are missing, try running `go get <dependency>` to download them.

5. Check if the required module has any version constraints that are not compatible with the other modules in your project. You can check the module's `go.mod` file to see its version constraints. If the constraints are not compatible, you may need to update the constraints or use a different version of the module.

I hope these suggestions help you debug the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions.
