The error message "419 Page Expired" usually occurs when the CSRF token expires. The CSRF token is a security feature in Laravel that helps prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. 

To avoid this error message, you can try the following solutions:

1. Increase the CSRF token lifetime: By default, the CSRF token lifetime is set to 120 minutes. You can increase this value in the `App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken` middleware by setting the `$lifetime` property to a higher value.

2. Use AJAX requests for logout: Instead of using a regular form submission for logout, you can use AJAX requests to send the logout request to the server. This way, the CSRF token will be refreshed automatically, and you won't get the "419 Page Expired" error.

3. Redirect to the login page after logout: After logging out, you can redirect the user to the login page instead of the previous page. This way, even if the user tries to access the previous page, they will be redirected to the login page and won't see the error message.

4. Use a JavaScript library to handle CSRF tokens: There are several JavaScript libraries available that can handle CSRF tokens automatically. You can use one of these libraries to handle CSRF tokens on the client-side and avoid the "419 Page Expired" error.
