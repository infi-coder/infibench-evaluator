This error message suggests that the preview target is not included in the current scheme. You can try the following steps to fix the issue:

1. Go to the project settings and select the scheme that you are using.
2. Click on "Manage Schemes" and make sure that the preview target is included in the list of targets for the scheme.
3. If the preview target is not included, click on the "+" button and add it to the list of targets.
4. Clean and rebuild the project, and try running the preview again.

If this doesn't work, you can also try resetting the Xcode preferences by running the following command in the terminal:

```
defaults delete com.apple.dt.Xcode
```

This will reset all Xcode preferences to their default values, which may help resolve the issue.
