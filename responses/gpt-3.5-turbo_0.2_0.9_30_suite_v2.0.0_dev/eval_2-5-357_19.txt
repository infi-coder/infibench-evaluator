Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended way of injecting dependencies in Spring. It makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It also ensures that the required dependencies are available at the time of object creation. Additionally, it allows the class to be immutable, which is a good practice in object-oriented programming. However, if you don't want to use `@Autowired`, you can still inject dependencies using setter methods or field injection.
