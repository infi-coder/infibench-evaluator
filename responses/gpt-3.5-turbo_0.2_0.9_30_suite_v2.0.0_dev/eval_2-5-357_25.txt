Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly indicates that the class has a dependency on another class, and it ensures that the dependency is satisfied before the class is used. Additionally, it makes the class immutable, which is a good design practice. However, if you prefer to use constructor injection without `@Autowired`, you can do so.
