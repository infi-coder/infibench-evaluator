The `sourceMap` option in `tsconfig.json` generates a source map file that maps the generated JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. This is useful for debugging purposes, as it allows you to debug the TypeScript code directly in the browser's developer tools.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the source map file will not be generated. This means that you will not be able to debug the TypeScript code directly in the browser's developer tools. Instead, you will have to debug the generated JavaScript code, which can be more difficult and time-consuming.

However, setting `"sourceMap": false` can also have some benefits. The source map file can be quite large, and disabling it can reduce the size of your application's build output. This can result in faster load times for your application.

In summary, setting `"sourceMap": false` will disable the generation of the source map file, which can make debugging more difficult but can also result in faster load times for your application.
