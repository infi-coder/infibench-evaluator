The error message you received indicates that there is a problem with the interpreter for the `npm` command. This could be caused by a few different things, but one common issue is that the file has Windows line endings instead of Unix line endings.

To fix this issue, you can try running the following command to convert the line endings of the `npm` file:

```
sudo apt-get install dos2unix
sudo dos2unix /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm
```

This will install the `dos2unix` package and then use it to convert the line endings of the `npm` file.

After running this command, try running `npm -v` again to see if the issue has been resolved.
