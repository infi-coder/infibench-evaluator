This error message usually occurs when the preview target is not included in the current scheme. To fix this, try the following steps:
1. Go to the scheme editor by clicking on the scheme dropdown in the top left corner of Xcode and selecting "Edit Scheme".
2. Select the "Build" tab and make sure that the preview target is checked under the "Build" column.
3. Select the "Run" tab and make sure that the preview target is selected under the "Info" tab.
4. Clean and rebuild the project.
5. Try running the preview again.

If this doesn't work, you can also try resetting Xcode preferences by running the following command in Terminal:
```
defaults delete com.apple.dt.Xcode
```
Note that this will reset all Xcode preferences to their default values.
