Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the following command:

```
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you to enter your current passphrase for the key and then ask you to enter a new passphrase (you can leave it blank if you don't want a passphrase).

After running this command, your id_rsa file will be converted to an RSA private key and will start with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

As for your second question, you don't need to transfer your id_rsa.pub file as it is just the public key that corresponds to your private key. The server administrator should already have your public key on their server from when you sent it to them previously.
