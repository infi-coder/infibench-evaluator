To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to make sure your project is using Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) or later. Then, you can add the following dependencies to your app-level build.gradle file:

```
android {
    ...
    buildFeatures {
        compose true
    }
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:1.0.0"
    ...
}
```

After adding these dependencies, you can start using Jetpack Compose in your existing project.
