Sure! The definition of `FruitsAndColors` is almost correct, but we need to use the `keyof` operator instead of `in` to reference the keys of the `fruit` and `color` types. Here's the corrected code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in keyof fruit]: number;
  [key in keyof color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type with a numeric property for each fruit and a boolean property for each color.
