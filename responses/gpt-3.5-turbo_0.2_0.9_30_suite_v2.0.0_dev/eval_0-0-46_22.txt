The error message indicates that ESLint is unable to find the `tsconfig.json` file. This is because the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of the project, while the `.eslintrc.js` file is located in the `src` directory.

To fix this issue, you need to update the `parserOptions` property in the `.eslintrc.js` file to include the path to the `tsconfig.json` file relative to the location of the `.eslintrc.js` file. In your case, you can update the `parserOptions` property as follows:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "../tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This assumes that the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of the project, one level above the `src` directory.

After making this change, you may need to restart VSCode for the changes to take effect.
