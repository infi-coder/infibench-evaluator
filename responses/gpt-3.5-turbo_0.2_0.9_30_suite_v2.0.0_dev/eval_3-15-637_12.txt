The issue could be related to the compatibility of the Selenium WebDriver with Excel 2019. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium WebDriver installed. You can download it from the Selenium website.

2. Check if the reference to the Selenium Type Library is correctly set in your VBA project. To do this, go to the VBA editor, click on Tools > References, and make sure that the checkbox next to "Selenium Type Library" is checked.

3. Try using a different browser driver. For example, instead of using the Internet Explorer driver, try using the Chrome driver or the Firefox driver.

4. Try running the code in compatibility mode. To do this, right-click on the Excel icon and select Properties. In the Compatibility tab, select "Windows 8" or "Windows 7" compatibility mode.

5. If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling Excel 2019 and the Selenium WebDriver.

Hopefully, one of these steps will resolve the issue.
