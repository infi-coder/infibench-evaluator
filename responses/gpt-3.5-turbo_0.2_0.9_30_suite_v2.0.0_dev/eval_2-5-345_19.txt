This error occurs because IntelliJ IDEA is using an older version of Maven (3.6.x) that is not compatible with Spring Boot 2.7, which requires Maven 3.8.5 or later.

To fix this issue, you need to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the correct version of Maven. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and go to File > Settings (or press Ctrl + Alt + S on Windows or Linux, or Cmd + , on macOS).
2. In the Settings dialog, go to Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.
3. In the Maven settings, make sure that the correct version of Maven is selected. If not, click on the "+" button to add a new Maven installation and select the path to the Maven installation directory.
4. Click OK to save the changes.

After configuring IntelliJ IDEA to use the correct version of Maven, you should be able to import the Spring Boot project without any issues.
