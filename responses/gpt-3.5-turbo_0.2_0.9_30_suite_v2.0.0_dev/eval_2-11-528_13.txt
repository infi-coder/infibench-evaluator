You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and keep them in the order they appear in the source file. Note that this may result in warnings or errors from your compiler if the include order is incorrect for certain third-party libraries. It's generally recommended to follow the recommended include order for each library to avoid any potential issues.
