To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to follow these steps:

1. Update your Android Studio to the latest version.
2. Add the following lines to your app-level build.gradle file:

```
android {
    ...
    buildFeatures {
        compose true
    }
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:1.0.0'
}
```

3. Sync your project with Gradle.
4. Start using Jetpack Compose in your project.

Note: You may need to update your project's minimum SDK version to 21 or higher to use Jetpack Compose.
