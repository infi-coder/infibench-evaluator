It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is present in the module cache on computer B. You can find the module cache location by running `go env GOMODCACHE`. If the module is not present, try running `go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5` to download it.

2. Check if the module is accessible from computer B. Try running `go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5` to see if the module can be resolved.

3. Check if there are any network issues preventing the module from being downloaded. Try running `go env -w GOPRIVATE=github.ibm.com` to tell Go that the `github.ibm.com` domain is private and should be accessed using your credentials.

4. Check if there are any issues with the version of Go being used on computer B. Make sure that the version of Go is the same on both computers.

5. Check if there are any issues with the firewall or proxy settings on computer B that may be preventing the module from being downloaded.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you debug the issue and get the module downloaded on computer B.
