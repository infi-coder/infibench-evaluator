The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` suggests that the package `aws-sdk-js` could not be found in the npm registry. This could be due to a temporary issue with the registry or a problem with your internet connection.

You can try running `npm cache clean` to clear the npm cache and then try running `npm install` again. If that doesn't work, you can try specifying a specific version of the package to install, for example `npm install aws-sdk-js@2.0.0`. 

If the issue persists, you can try using a different npm registry, such as the one provided by Yarn (`yarn install`), or a mirror of the npm registry.
