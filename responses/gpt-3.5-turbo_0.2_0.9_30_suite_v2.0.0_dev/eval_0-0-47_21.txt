Yes, you can define an interface for the object type and use it as the type for the array parameter. Here's an example:

```typescript
interface Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}

const bagTotal = (products: Product[]) => {
  // function does stuff
}
```

This defines an interface `Product` with the required properties `name`, `price`, and `description`. Then, the `bagTotal` function takes an array of objects of type `Product` as its parameter.
