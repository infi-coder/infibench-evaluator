The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` suggests that the package you are trying to install (`aws-sdk-js`) cannot be found in the npm registry. This could be due to a temporary issue with the registry or because the package has been removed.

You can try running `npm cache clean` to clear the npm cache and then try running `npm install` again. If that doesn't work, you can try installing a specific version of the package by running `npm install aws-sdk-js@<version>` where `<version>` is the version number you want to install. 

If neither of these solutions work, you can try using a different npm registry. You can set the registry to use by running `npm config set registry <registry-url>` where `<registry-url>` is the URL of the registry you want to use.
