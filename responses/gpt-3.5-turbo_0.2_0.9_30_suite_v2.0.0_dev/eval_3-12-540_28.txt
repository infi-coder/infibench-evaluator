Yes, in Flutter you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here's an example of how to use it:

```
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        height: 100,
        color: Colors.blue,
      ),
    ),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        height: 100,
        color: Colors.green,
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a `Row` widget is used to display two `Container` widgets with a `VerticalDivider` widget in between. The `color` property is used to set the color of the divider, `thickness` is used to set the thickness of the divider, and `width` is used to set the width of the divider.
