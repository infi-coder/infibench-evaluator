Here's the revised code for the `pig_latin` function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
  words = text.split()
  pig_words = []
  for word in words:
    endString = str(word[1:]).lower()
    startString = str(word[0]).lower()
    pig_word = endString + startString + 'ay'
    pig_words.append(pig_word)
  return ' '.join(pig_words)
```

The main changes are:

- Instead of returning the pig Latin version of each word immediately, we append it to a list `pig_words`.
- We use `str(word[1:])` to get all characters of the word except the first one, and `str(word[0])` to get only the first character. We also convert them to lowercase using the `lower()` method.
- We concatenate the end string, start string, and "ay" to form the pig Latin version of the word.
- Finally, we join all the pig Latin words in the list using a space character and return the resulting string.
