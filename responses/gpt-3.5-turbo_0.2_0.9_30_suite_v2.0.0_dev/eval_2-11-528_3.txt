You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by using the `SortIncludes` option. To disable it completely, set it to `false` in your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will prevent clang-format from reordering your includes. However, keep in mind that this may cause issues with third-party libraries that require a specific include order. It's important to follow the recommended include order for those libraries to avoid any potential problems.
