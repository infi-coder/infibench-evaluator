You can use the `tidyr` package in R to split the column into separate columns. Here's a possible implementation of the `mySplit` function:

```r
library(tidyr)

mySplit <- function(df) {
  # separate the column into multiple columns based on comma and colon separators
  df_split <- separate(df, col1, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = "[,:]")
  
  # remove the first column, which is just the row numbers
  df_split <- df_split[, -1]
  
  # return the resulting data frame
  return(df_split)
}
```

Here's how you can use the function:

```r
# create the example data frame
df <- data.frame(col1 = c("name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC", "name:Tom,Age:25,City:NA"))

# call the function to split the column
df_split <- mySplit(df)

# print the resulting data frame
print(df_split)
```

This should output:

```
     name Age City
1 Michael  31  NYC
2     Tom  25   NA
```
