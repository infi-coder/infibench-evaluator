The issue is that `ContentView_Previews` is using `@State` instead of `@Binding` for the `selected` variable. Change `@State` to `@Binding` and pass a `Bool` value to `ContentView` to fix the issue. Here's the updated code:

```
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    @State static var selected: Bool = false

    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $selected)
    }
}
```

should be changed to:

```
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    @Binding static var selected: Bool = false

    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $selected)
    }
}
```
