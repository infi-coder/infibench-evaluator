Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended approach for dependency injection in Spring. It ensures that the required dependencies are injected at the time of object creation and makes the class immutable. This approach also helps in avoiding the circular dependencies issue. However, if you are using Spring 4.3 or later, you can omit the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor as Spring will automatically detect the constructor and inject the dependencies.
