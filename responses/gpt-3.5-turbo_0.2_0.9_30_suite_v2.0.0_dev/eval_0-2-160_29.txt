When you set `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file, the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your TypeScript code. 

Source maps are used to map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code, which is useful for debugging and error reporting. If you set `"sourceMap": false`, your compiled JavaScript code will not have a source map associated with it, which means that you won't be able to debug your TypeScript code directly in the browser's developer tools.

However, setting `"sourceMap": false` can improve the performance of your application, as generating source maps can be a time-consuming process. It can also reduce the size of your compiled JavaScript files, as source maps can add additional overhead to the file size.

In summary, setting `"sourceMap": false` can improve the performance and reduce the size of your application, but it will make debugging your TypeScript code more difficult.
