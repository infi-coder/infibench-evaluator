It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` cannot be found or downloaded on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is available in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is not found, then it needs to be downloaded. If it is found, then it may be a versioning issue.

2. Try to download the module manually by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   This will download the module and add it to the module cache. If this command fails, then there may be an issue with your credentials or access to the private repo.

3. Check if the module is available on the remote repository by visiting the URL `https://github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client/tree/v0.1.5`. If the module is not available, then it may have been deleted or renamed.

4. Check if the version `v0.1.5` is the latest version of the module. If it is not, then you may need to update the version in your `go.mod` file.

5. If none of the above steps work, try running the following command to clear the module cache and download all dependencies again:

   ```bash
   go clean -modcache
   go mod download
   ```

   This will clear the module cache and download all dependencies again. This may take some time, but it should ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date and available in the module cache.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you debug the issue and get the module downloaded on computer B.
