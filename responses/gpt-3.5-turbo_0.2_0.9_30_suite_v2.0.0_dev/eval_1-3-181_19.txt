You can use the `numpy.max()` function along with the appropriate axis parameter to get the maximum value of each column in the third dimension of the array. Here's the code for the `getMax()` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def getMax(matrix):
    max_values = np.max(matrix[:,:,2], axis=1)
    return max_values.reshape(-1, 1)
```

In this function, we first use `matrix[:,:,2]` to select the third column of each 2D array in the 3D array. Then, we use `np.max()` with `axis=1` to get the maximum value of each column in the third dimension. Finally, we use `reshape()` to convert the resulting 1D array into a 2D array with a single column.

You can call this function with your example array like so:

```python
matrix = np.array([[[4, 1, 5, 2, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 7],
                    [7, 4, 2, 4, 7, 8, 4, 1, 3, 5],
                    [6, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6],
                    [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 3, 8, 7, 1],
                    [2, 8, 6, 7, 4, 7, 5, 5, 5, 1]],
                   
                   [[9, 9, 5, 8, 0, 7, 3, 9, 8, 1],
                    [9, 1, 9, 5, 7, 4, 5, 4, 7, 0],
                    [1, 0, 4, 8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 8, 8],
                    [8, 1, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 9, 3, 8],
                    [4, 0, 2, 3, 8, 2, 0, 1, 2, 4]],
