To show the toast, you need to call the `toast()` method on the `.toast` element. Here's how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast message on the screen. Make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap and jQuery files in your HTML code.
