Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended approach for dependency injection in Spring. It ensures that the dependencies are injected at the time of object creation and makes the class immutable. It also helps in avoiding the circular dependency problem. However, if you are using Spring 4.3 or higher, you can omit the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor and Spring will still inject the dependencies automatically.
