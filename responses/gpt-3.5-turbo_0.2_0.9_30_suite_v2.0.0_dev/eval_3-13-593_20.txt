To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to make sure that your project is using at least Android Studio 4.0 and that your project is targeting Android API level 21 or higher. 

Then, you need to add the following dependencies to your project's build.gradle file:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.6.0'
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.1'
    implementation 'androidx.activity:activity-compose:1.3.1'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.1'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.1'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.runtime:runtime-livedata:1.0.1'
}
```

After adding these dependencies, you can start using Jetpack Compose in your existing project. You can create Composable functions and use them in your existing activities or fragments. Make sure to also update your layout files to use the `androidx.compose.ui.platform.ComposeView` instead of the traditional `ViewGroup`.
