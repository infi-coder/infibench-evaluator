You need to remove the single quotes around `$searchT` in the `grep` command inside the `if` statement. Single quotes prevent variable expansion, so the `$searchT` variable is not being replaced with its value. Here's the corrected code:

```
bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" && wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

By using double quotes, the `$searchT` variable is expanded and its value is used in the `grep` command.
