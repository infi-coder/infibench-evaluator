As of now, there is no official adapter for Enzyme that supports React 17. However, you can use the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package as an unofficial adapter for React 17.

To use this adapter, you need to install it first:

```
npm install --save-dev @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can modify your import code to use the new adapter like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

This should allow you to use Enzyme with React 17.
