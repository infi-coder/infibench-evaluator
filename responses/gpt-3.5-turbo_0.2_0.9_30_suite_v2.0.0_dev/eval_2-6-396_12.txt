The error message is caused by the `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` line in your `OnModelCreating` method. You are trying to create an index on the `Gender` navigation property, which is not allowed because it is already configured as a navigation property.

To solve this problem, you can remove the `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` line and add an index on the `GenderId` property instead:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    }
}
```

This will create an index on the `GenderId` property, which is the foreign key for the `Gender` navigation property.
