You need to add two things to your `~/.zshenv`. First, add the rbenv initialization itself by adding the following line at the beginning of the file:
```
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```
Second, add the ruby path by adding the following line after the rbenv initialization:
```
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/shims:${PATH}"
```
You might also run the `rbenv doctor` command to check your installation.
