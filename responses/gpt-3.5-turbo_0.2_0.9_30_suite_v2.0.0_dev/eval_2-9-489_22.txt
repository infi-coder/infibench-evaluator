This warning message is related to Elasticsearch security features that are not enabled by default. To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch security features by following the steps below:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file located at `config/elasticsearch.yml` in your Rails app.

2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:

   ```
   xpack.security.enabled: true
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode: certificate
   ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

   If you're using Homebrew, you can restart Elasticsearch by running the following command:

   ```
   brew services restart elasticsearch-full
   ```

   If you're not using Homebrew, you can restart Elasticsearch by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo service elasticsearch restart
   ```

4. Verify that Elasticsearch security features are enabled by running the following command:

   ```
   curl -u elastic 'http://localhost:9200/_xpack/security/_authenticate?pretty'
   ```

   If Elasticsearch security features are enabled, you should see a response that includes the word "authenticated".

That should fix the Elasticsearch warning message.
