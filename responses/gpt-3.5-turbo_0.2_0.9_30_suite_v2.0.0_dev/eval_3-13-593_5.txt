To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to do the following steps:

1. Update your project to use Android Studio 4.2 or later.
2. Add the following dependencies to your app's `build.gradle` file:
```
android {
    ...
    buildFeatures {
        compose true
    }
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:1.0.0'
    ...
}
```
3. Sync your project with Gradle.
4. Start using Jetpack Compose in your project by creating Composable functions and using Compose UI elements.

Note that Jetpack Compose is still in beta, so some APIs may change in future releases.
