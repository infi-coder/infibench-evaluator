It seems like the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` which means it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0` which will allow it to accept connections from any IP address.

To do this, you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file to include the `host` option:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0'
    }
})
```

Then, when you run the Vite server inside the Docker container, you need to bind the container's port to the host's IP address instead of binding it to `localhost`. You can do this by modifying your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  app:
    image: myapp
    build: .
    container_name: myapp
    ports:
      - "0.0.0.0:8080:8080"
```

With these changes, the Vite server should be accessible from outside the Docker container at `http://localhost:8080`.
