The reason why you are seeing the logs in that order is because the `onItemSelected` function is called asynchronously when the user selects an item from the spinner. This means that the `return` statement in your function is executed before the `onItemSelected` function is called.

To fix this, you can use a callback function to return the selected item instead of returning it directly from the `setupListWithAdapter` function. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use a callback:

```
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>, callback: (String) -> Unit) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            Log.e("categoryLog","1 : " + itemSelected)
            callback(itemSelected)
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
    Log.e("categoryLog","2 : ")
}
```

In this modified code, the `setupListWithAdapter` function takes a callback function as a parameter. The callback function takes a `String` parameter and returns `Unit` (i.e., nothing). When an item is selected from the spinner, the `onItemSelected` function calls the callback function with the selected item as its parameter. The `setupListWithAdapter` function no longer returns a value directly, but instead calls the callback function with the selected item when it is available.

To use this modified function in your fragment, you can pass a lambda function as the callback parameter. Here's an example:

```
spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list) { selectedItem ->
    // Do something with the selected item
    Log.e("categoryLog","Selected item: $selectedItem")
}
```

In this example, the lambda function logs the selected item to the console, but you can replace this with your own logic for handling the selected item.
