This error is caused by a known issue with rust-analyzer, where it sometimes fails to resolve macros correctly. In this case, it is failing to resolve the `format_args` macro, which is used internally by the `pad_str` function.

Fortunately, this error does not affect the correctness of your code or your ability to run tests. If you want to get rid of the error in rust-analyzer, you can try updating your dependencies to the latest versions, as this issue has been fixed in some recent releases.

If updating your dependencies does not fix the issue, you can try disabling the `rust-analyzer` extension in your editor, or using a different editor that does not have this issue.
