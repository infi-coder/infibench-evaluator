Your code looks correct. However, if the user denies the location access, the `else` block will not be executed. Instead, an error will be thrown. To handle this error, you can add a second function as the second parameter of `getCurrentPosition()` method. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => {
        console.log("Location accessed");
    }, error => {
        console.log("User not allowed");
    });
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

This code will log "Location accessed" if the user allows location access, and "User not allowed" if the user denies location access. If geolocation is not supported by the browser, it will log "Geolocation is not supported by this browser."
