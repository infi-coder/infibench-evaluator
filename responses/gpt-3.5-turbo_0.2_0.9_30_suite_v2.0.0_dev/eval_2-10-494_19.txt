This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, which is a language server for Rust. It is a false positive and does not indicate any issues with your code. You can safely ignore this error for now and continue working on your project. 

However, if you want to get rid of the error, you can try updating rust-analyzer to the latest version or disabling it temporarily. To disable rust-analyzer in VS Code, you can add the following line to your settings.json file:

```json
"rust-analyzer.enable": false
```

This will disable rust-analyzer for your Rust projects.
