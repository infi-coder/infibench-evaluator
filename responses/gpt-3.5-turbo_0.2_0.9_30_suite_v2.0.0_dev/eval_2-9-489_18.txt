The warning message is indicating that Elasticsearch built-in security features are not enabled and your cluster could be accessible to anyone without authentication. To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch security features.

Here are the steps to enable Elasticsearch security features:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` in your Rails app.

2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:
```
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```
These lines enable Elasticsearch security and SSL encryption for transport.

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning message should disappear. If you still see the warning message, you may need to check your Elasticsearch version and upgrade to a version that supports security features.
