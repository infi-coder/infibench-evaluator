The issue is that you are missing a comma after the color value for the "primary" key in your `$theme-colors` map. Here's the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here, // add a comma here
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace `#your-color-here` with the actual color value you want to use. 

With this correction, the `$theme-colors` map should be a valid CSS value and the error should go away.
