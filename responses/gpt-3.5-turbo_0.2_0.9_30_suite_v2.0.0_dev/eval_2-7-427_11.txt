For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. Here are some possible solutions:

1. Make sure that the domain name in your .env file matches the domain name of your hosted application. If they don't match, the session cookie may not be set properly.

2. Check if your hosting provider has any security features that could be interfering with the session cookie. For example, some hosting providers may block third-party cookies by default.

3. Try clearing your browser cache and cookies, then reload the page and see if the error persists.

4. Check if there are any conflicting middleware or packages that could be interfering with the session.

As for the second issue, the error message "SSL operation failed with code 1. OpenSSL Error messages: error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number" suggests that the SSL version being used is not supported by the server. Here are some possible solutions:

1. Try changing the encryption type in your .env file to "tls" instead of "ssl".

2. Check with your client if they support SSL encryption and if so, which version they support.

3. Try using a different email service provider that supports the SSL version being used by the server.

4. Check if there are any firewalls or security settings on your server that could be blocking the connection.
