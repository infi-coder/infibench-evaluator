The error message is indicating that you cannot create an index on a navigation property, which is the case for the `Gender` property in the `User` entity. To solve this problem, you can create an index on the foreign key property `GenderId` instead. 

Here's the updated code for your `OnModelCreating` method:
```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```
This should allow you to create the migration without any errors.
