The "f" in `print(f"...")` is used to create a formatted string literal in Python, also known as an f-string. 

An f-string is a string literal that is prefixed with the letter "f" or "F". It allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {}. The expressions inside the curly braces are evaluated at runtime and their values are inserted into the string.

In your example, the curly braces are used to insert the values of the variables `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` into the string. The `f` before the string literal tells Python to treat the string as an f-string and evaluate any expressions inside the curly braces.

So, `print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")` will print the string "Input directory:" followed by the value of `args.input_directory`. The same applies to the second `print` statement.
