To use the Swagger UI with Spring Boot, you need to make sure that you have the following configurations in your application:

1. Add the `@EnableSwagger2WebMvc` annotation to your Spring Boot application class.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSwagger2WebMvc
public class YourApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(YourApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

2. Make sure that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` property is set to `/swagger-ui.html` in your `application.properties` file.

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui.html
```

3. Verify that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled` property is set to `true` in your `application.properties` file.

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=true
```

4. Make sure that your API documentation is available at `/v3/api-docs`. You can verify this by accessing `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs` in your browser.

If you have followed these steps and still cannot access the Swagger UI, try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser.
