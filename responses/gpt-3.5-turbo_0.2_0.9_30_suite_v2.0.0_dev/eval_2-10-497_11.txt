In Rust, a `Box` is a smart pointer that represents ownership of a heap-allocated object. To check if a `Box` is a null pointer, you can use the `Box::into_raw` method to convert the `Box` into a raw pointer, and then check if the pointer is null.

Here's an example implementation of the `Stack` struct that checks if the `top` field is a null pointer:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Box<Node>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Box<Node>,
}

impl Stack {
    fn new() -> Stack {
        Stack { top: Box::new(Node { value: 0, next: Box::new(Node { value: 0, next: Box::null() }) }) }
    }

    fn is_empty(&self) -> bool {
        self.top.as_ref() as *const Node == std::ptr::null()
    }
}
```

In this example, the `is_empty` method checks if the `top` field is a null pointer by converting it to a raw pointer using the `as_ref` method and then comparing it to the null pointer using the `std::ptr::null` function. Note that the `as_ref` method is used to convert the `Box<Node>` into a reference to the `Node` struct, which is required to use the `as *const Node` syntax to get a raw pointer.
