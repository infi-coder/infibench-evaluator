Both approaches are valid and work in Spring. However, using `@Autowired` on the constructor is considered a best practice because it makes the code more readable and easier to maintain. It also ensures that the required dependencies are injected at the time of object creation, which can help prevent null pointer exceptions. Additionally, using `@Autowired` on the constructor allows for the class to be immutable, which can improve thread safety and make the code easier to reason about.
