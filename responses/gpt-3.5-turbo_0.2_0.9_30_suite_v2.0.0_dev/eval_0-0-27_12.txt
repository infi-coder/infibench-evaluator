It seems that the issue is related to the network configuration of your Apollo Client. The `uri` you are using in your `ApolloClient` configuration is not working properly. 

Instead of using the `uri` provided in the Apollo Client documentation, you can try using a different GraphQL API endpoint to test your code. For example, you can use the following endpoint:

```
https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io/graphql
```

This endpoint is also provided in the Apollo Client documentation, and it should work properly with your code.

Here's the updated `ApolloClient` configuration:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io/graphql',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

With this change, your code should be able to fetch data properly.
