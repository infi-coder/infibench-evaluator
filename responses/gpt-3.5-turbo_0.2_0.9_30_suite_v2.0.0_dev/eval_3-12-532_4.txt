The `FormatException` occurs when the response body is not in a valid JSON format. To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the response body: You can print the response body and check if it is in a valid JSON format. If it is not, you need to fix the PHP file to return a valid JSON response.

2. Check the content-type header: Make sure that the content-type header of the response is set to `application/json`. If it is not, you can set it in the PHP file or in the Flutter code.

3. Use a try-catch block: Wrap the `json.decode()` method in a try-catch block to catch the `FormatException` and handle it gracefully. For example:

```dart
try {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
  // do something with the data
} catch (e) {
  print('Error decoding JSON: $e');
}
```

By using these steps, you should be able to solve the `FormatException` and decode the JSON response successfully.
