If you want to use the same version of Java that works with the Maven task, you can specify the path to the Java executable in the `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable. Here's an example:

```
MAVEN_OPTS="-Dmaven.compiler.source=1.8 -Dmaven.compiler.target=1.8 -Djava.home=/path/to/java" ./mvnw clean install
```

Replace `/path/to/java` with the path to the Java executable that works with the Maven task. This will set the `java.home` system property to the specified path, which should make Maven use the correct version of Java.
