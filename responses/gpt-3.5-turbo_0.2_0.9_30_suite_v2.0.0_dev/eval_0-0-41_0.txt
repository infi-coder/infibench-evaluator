Your code looks correct. However, if the user denies the location access, the `getCurrentPosition()` method will not execute the success callback function. Therefore, you need to add an error callback function to handle the case where the user denies the location access. Here is the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In the revised code, the `getCurrentPosition()` method takes two callback functions as arguments. The first function is executed when the location access is granted, and the second function is executed when the location access is denied.
