You can use the `tidyr` package in R to split the comma and colon separated column into respective columns. Here's the code for the `mySplit` function:

```r
library(tidyr)

mySplit <- function(df) {
  df_new <- separate(df, col1, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = ",|:")
  return(df_new)
}
```

In this function, we first load the `tidyr` package. Then, we use the `separate` function to split the `col1` column into three separate columns - `name`, `Age`, and `City`. We specify the `sep` argument as `",|:"` to split the column based on both commas and colons. Finally, we return the new data frame `df_new`.

You can call this function by passing your original data frame `df` as an argument:

```r
df <- data.frame(col1 = c("name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC", "name:Tom,Age:25,City:NA"))
mySplit(df)
```

This will return the desired output:

```
     name Age City
1 Michael  31  NYC
2     Tom  25   NA
```
