The warning message is indicating that Elasticsearch built-in security features are not enabled, which means that anyone can access your Elasticsearch cluster. To fix this, you need to enable security features in Elasticsearch.

Here are the steps to enable security features in Elasticsearch:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` located in the `config` directory of your Elasticsearch installation.

2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:

```
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning message should disappear. However, you may need to configure additional security settings depending on your specific use case. You can refer to the Elasticsearch documentation for more information on configuring security features.
