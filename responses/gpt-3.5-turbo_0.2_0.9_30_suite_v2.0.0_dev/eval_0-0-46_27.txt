The error message you are seeing is related to ESLint, which is a popular linting tool used to analyze code for potential errors and style issues. It seems that ESLint is unable to find the `tsconfig.json` file in your project.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project. If it is already in the root directory, you can try specifying the path to the `tsconfig.json` file in your `.eslintrc.js` file.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, change the `parserOptions` property to include the `tsconfigRootDir` property as follows:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./tsconfig.json",
  tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This tells ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory of your project.

If this does not work, you can try specifying the full path to the `tsconfig.json` file in the `parserOptions` property.

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "/full/path/to/tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

Replace `/full/path/to/` with the actual path to the `tsconfig.json` file.

After making these changes, restart VSCode and see if the error message disappears.
