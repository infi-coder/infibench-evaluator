The "f" in `print(f"...")` is used to format the string. It is called an f-string or formatted string literal. 

In the example you provided, the curly braces `{}` are used to insert the values of the variables `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` into the string. The values are inserted into the string at runtime, making it easier to read and write code that involves string formatting.

For example, instead of writing:

```python
print("Input directory: " + args.input_directory)
print("Output directory: " + args.output_directory)
```

You can use f-strings to make the code more concise and easier to read:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

The values inside the curly braces can also be expressions, making it even more powerful.
