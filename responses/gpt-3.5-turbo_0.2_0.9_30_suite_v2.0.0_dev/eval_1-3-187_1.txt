You can use the following function to replace the elements in `b` with the elements in `rest` and then replace the matching elements in `last` with the corresponding elements from `rest`:

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    for i in range(len(rest)):
        b[i] = rest[i]
        for j in range(len(last)):
            if last[j] == b[i]:
                last[j] = rest[i]
    return last
```

Here's how you can use this function with your example lists:

```python
rest = [5, 7, 11, 4]
b = [21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last = [33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

new_last = ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last)
print(new_last)
```

Output:
```
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```
