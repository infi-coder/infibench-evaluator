This warning is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled. Without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone. 

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch security. Here are the steps to enable security:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` located in the `config` directory of your Elasticsearch installation.

2. Uncomment the following lines:
```
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After enabling security, you will need to configure authentication and authorization. You can refer to the Elasticsearch documentation for more information on how to configure security: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html
