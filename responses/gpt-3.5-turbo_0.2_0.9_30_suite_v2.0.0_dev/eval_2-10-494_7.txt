This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, which is a language server for Rust that provides IDE-like features such as code completion, error highlighting, and refactoring tools. The error message is indicating that rust-analyzer is having trouble resolving the `format_args` macro, which is used internally by the `pad_str` function.

This error should not affect the functionality of your code, and it is likely that it will be fixed in a future release of rust-analyzer. However, if you want to get rid of the error message, you can try updating your dependencies to see if that resolves the issue. You can also try disabling rust-analyzer and using another language server, such as RLS or IntelliJ Rust, to see if the error persists.
