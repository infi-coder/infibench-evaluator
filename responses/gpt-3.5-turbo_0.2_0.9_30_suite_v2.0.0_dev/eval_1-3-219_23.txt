Here are a few things you can try to solve the issue:

1. Make sure that the Jupyter package is installed in your virtual environment. You can do this by activating the environment and running `conda list` or `pip list` to see if Jupyter is listed. If it is not installed, you can install it using `conda install jupyter` or `pip install jupyter`.

2. Check if the Jupyter extension is installed in VS Code. You can do this by going to the Extensions tab and searching for "Jupyter". If it is not installed, you can install it from there.

3. Try running Jupyter notebook outside of VS Code to see if it works. Open a terminal, activate your virtual environment, and run `jupyter notebook`. If it works, then the issue may be with the VS Code integration.

4. Check if there are any firewall or antivirus settings that may be blocking the connection to the IPython kernel. Try temporarily disabling them to see if it solves the issue.

5. Try creating a new virtual environment and installing Jupyter in it to see if it works. If it does, then the issue may be with the previous environment.

Hopefully one of these solutions will solve your problem.
