@Configuration should be used when you want to define beans using Java configuration instead of XML configuration. It is typically used to define beans that require more complex configuration, such as beans that depend on other beans or beans that require conditional configuration. @Service, @Controller, and @Component are used to annotate classes as Spring-managed beans, but they do not provide the same level of configuration flexibility as @Configuration.
