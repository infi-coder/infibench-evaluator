You need to use the `toast()` method to show the toast. Here's an example:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast with the default animation. You can also customize the animation by passing an object with options to the `toast()` method. For example:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast({
  animation: true,
  delay: 5000
}).toast('show');
```

This will show the toast with a fade animation and a delay of 5 seconds before it disappears.
