To enable Developer Mode on iOS 16.0, follow these steps:

1. Open the Settings app on your iOS device.
2. Scroll down and tap on "Developer".
3. Toggle the switch next to "Developer Mode" to the on position.
4. You may be prompted to enter your device passcode or Apple ID password.
5. Once enabled, you should be able to run the provisioned testing build without any issues.

Note: If you do not see the "Developer" option in your Settings app, it may be because your device is not enrolled in an Apple Developer Program. In that case, you will need to enroll in the program to access Developer Mode.
