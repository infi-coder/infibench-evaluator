The "f" in `print(f"...")` stands for "formatted string literals" or "f-strings" in Python. It is a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`. 

In your example, the curly braces `{}` are used to embed the values of `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` inside the string literals. The values are evaluated at runtime and inserted into the string. 

For example, if `args.input_directory` is `"input"` and `args.output_directory` is `"output"`, the output of the two print statements would be:

```
Input directory: input
Output directory: output
```

Using f-strings can make string formatting easier and more readable, especially when you need to include multiple variables or expressions in a string.
