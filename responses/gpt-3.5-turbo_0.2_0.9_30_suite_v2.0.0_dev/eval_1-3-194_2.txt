To write a list of list into an Excel file, we can use the `openpyxl` module. Here's the implementation of the `writeToExcel` function:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeToExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
    sheet = wb.active
    for row in new_list:
        sheet.append(row)
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

In this function, we first create a new workbook using the `openpyxl.Workbook()` method. We then get the active worksheet using the `wb.active` attribute. We then loop through each row in the `new_list` and append it to the worksheet using the `sheet.append(row)` method. Finally, we save the workbook using the `wb.save("data.xlsx")` method. This will create a new Excel file named "data.xlsx" in the current working directory and write the contents of the `new_list` to it.
