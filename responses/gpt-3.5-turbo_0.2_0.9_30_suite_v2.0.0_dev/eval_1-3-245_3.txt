It seems that the Dockerfile is unable to find the `app` module. You can try modifying the `COPY` command in the Dockerfile to include the parent directory of the `app` module. Here's an updated Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /
RUN pip install --requirement /requirements.txt

COPY . /app

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

In this updated Dockerfile, we are copying the entire directory (including the `app` directory) into the `/app` directory in the container. This should ensure that the `app` module is available to the Docker container.

Also, make sure that your `docker-compose.yml` file is in the same directory as the Dockerfile and the `app` directory.
