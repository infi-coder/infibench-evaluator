It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is available in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is not available in the cache, you can try to download it manually by running:

   ```bash
   go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

2. Check if the module is available on the remote repository. You can do this by running:

   ```bash
   go list -m -versions github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
   ```

   This will show you all the available versions of the module on the remote repository. If the version `v0.1.5` is not available, you may need to update your dependency to a different version.

3. Check if there are any network issues preventing the module from being downloaded. You can try to download the module manually using `git clone` and see if there are any errors.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client.git
   ```

   If there are any errors, it may indicate that there are network issues preventing the module from being downloaded.

4. Check if there are any issues with your authentication credentials. You can try to authenticate to the remote repository manually using `git clone` and see if there are any errors.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client.git
   ```

   If there are any errors, it may indicate that there are issues with your authentication credentials.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you identify the issue and resolve it.
