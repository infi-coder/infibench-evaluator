This warning message is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled. Without authentication, your cluster could be accessible to anyone. 

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's security features. Here are the steps to enable security:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file located at `config/elasticsearch.yml`.
2. Add the following lines to the bottom of the file:
```
xpack.security.enabled: true
```
3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning message should disappear. If you still see the warning message, make sure that you have the latest version of Elasticsearch installed and that you have followed the instructions correctly.
