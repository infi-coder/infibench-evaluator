The Rule of 5 is not outdated, as it is still relevant in modern C++ programming. While it is true that implicit constructors and destructors work fine for aggregate data structures, there are cases where user-defined constructors and destructors are necessary.

For example, if a class manages a resource that cannot be handled by a smart pointer, such as a file handle or a network socket, then a user-defined destructor is necessary to properly release that resource. Similarly, if a class has non-copyable or non-movable members, then user-defined copy and move constructors and assignment operators are necessary to properly manage those members.

While it is true that smart pointers can be used to manage resources, they are not always the best solution. Smart pointers have overhead and can introduce complexity, especially in multi-threaded environments. In addition, there are cases where smart pointers are not appropriate, such as when dealing with low-level system resources.

In summary, while the Rule of 5 may not be necessary for all classes, it is still an important guideline to follow when dealing with resource management and non-copyable or non-movable members.
