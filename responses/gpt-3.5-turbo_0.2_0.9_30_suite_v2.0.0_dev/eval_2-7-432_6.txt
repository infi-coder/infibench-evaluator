The error message "419 Page Expired" is related to the CSRF token. Laravel uses CSRF tokens to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks. When you log out from one tab, the CSRF token is invalidated, and the other tab still has the old CSRF token, which is now invalid. That's why you get the "419 Page Expired" error when you try to log out from the other tab.

To avoid this issue, you can add a check in your logout function to see if the CSRF token is valid. If it's not valid, you can regenerate a new CSRF token and then log out the user. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```
public function logout(Request $request)
{
    if (!$request->session()->regenerateToken()) {
        return redirect()->back();
    }

    Auth::logout();

    return redirect('/');
}
```

In this example, we regenerate the CSRF token using the `regenerateToken()` method. If the method returns false, we redirect back to the previous page. Otherwise, we log out the user and redirect them to the home page.

By doing this, you can ensure that the user can log out from any tab without getting the "419 Page Expired" error.
