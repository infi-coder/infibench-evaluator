The `FormatException` error occurs when the JSON string is not properly formatted. In your case, it seems that the response from the server is not in a valid JSON format. 

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the response from the server by printing it to the console. You can use `print(response.body)` to see the response.

2. Validate the JSON response using an online JSON validator like https://jsonlint.com/. Paste the response from the server and check if it is valid.

3. If the response is not valid, you need to fix the PHP code that generates the response. Make sure that the response is in a valid JSON format.

4. If the response is valid, you can try using a try-catch block to handle the `FormatException` error. Here is an example:

```dart
try {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
  // process the data
} catch (e) {
  print('Error decoding JSON: $e');
}
```

This will catch the `FormatException` error and print the error message to the console. You can then investigate the error message to find the cause of the issue.
