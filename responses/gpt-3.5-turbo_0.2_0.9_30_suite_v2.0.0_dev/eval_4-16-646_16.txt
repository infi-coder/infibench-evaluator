This error occurs because pdftk is a 32-bit application and Catalina only supports 64-bit applications. Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. Use an alternative to pdftk: There are several alternatives to pdftk that are compatible with Catalina, such as PDFsam or QPDF. You can try using one of these instead.

2. Use a virtual machine: You can use a virtual machine to run an older version of MacOS that supports 32-bit applications. This will allow you to use pdftk without any issues.

3. Use Homebrew: You can install pdftk using Homebrew, which will install a version that is compatible with Catalina. To install Homebrew, open Terminal and run the following command:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to install pdftk:

```
brew install pdftk-java
```

4. Use Docker: You can use Docker to run pdftk in a container. This will allow you to use pdftk without any issues on Catalina. To do this, you will need to install Docker and then run the following command:

```
docker run -v /path/to/pdf:/pdf bwits/pdf2htmlex pdftk /pdf/input.pdf output /pdf/output.pdf
```

Replace `/path/to/pdf` with the path to your PDF file. This will create a new PDF file called `output.pdf` in the same directory.
