The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you will not have access to this attribute. 

To use `[Keyless]`, you need to make sure you have the following:

1. Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later installed in your project.
2. A reference to the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace in your code file.
3. A reference to the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace in your code file.

If you have all of these, you should be able to use `[Keyless]` as expected. If you are still having issues, try updating your Entity Framework Core version to the latest version.
