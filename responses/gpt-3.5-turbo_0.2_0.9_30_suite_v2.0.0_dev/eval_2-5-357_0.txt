Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended approach in Spring because it ensures that the required dependencies are injected at the time of object creation. This approach also makes the code more readable and easier to maintain. Additionally, it helps in avoiding the issues that may arise due to circular dependencies. However, if you are using Spring 4.3 or later, you can omit the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor as Spring will automatically detect and inject the dependencies.
