You need to add two things to your `~/.zshenv`. First, add the rbenv initialization itself by replacing the second line with `eval "$(rbenv init -)"`. Second, add the ruby version by replacing the first line with `export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/shims:$PATH"`. 

You might also run the command `rbenv doctor` to check your installation.
