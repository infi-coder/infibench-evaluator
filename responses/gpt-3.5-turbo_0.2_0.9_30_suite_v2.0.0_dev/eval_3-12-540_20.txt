Yes, in Flutter you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw a vertical line between components. 

Here's an example of how to use it:

```
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Text('Component 1'),
    VerticalDivider(),
    Text('Component 2'),
  ],
)
```

This will display two `Text` widgets with a vertical line between them. You can customize the appearance of the `VerticalDivider` by setting its `thickness`, `color`, and `indent` properties.
