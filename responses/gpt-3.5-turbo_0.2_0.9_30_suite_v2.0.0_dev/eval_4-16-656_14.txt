Yes, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to retrieve the description of a Windows service. Here's an example:

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description | Out-GridView
```

This will display a grid view with the name, display name, and description of all Windows services. You can also filter the results by service name or display name by adding a `Where-Object` clause, like this:

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "*search term*"} | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description | Out-GridView
```

Replace "search term" with the name or part of the name of the service you're looking for.
