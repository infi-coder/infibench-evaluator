It seems like the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` which means it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0`.

To do this, you can modify the `server.host` option in your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  server: {
    port: 8080,
    host: '0.0.0.0'
  }
})
```

This will bind the Vite server to all available network interfaces, including the one that Docker exposes.

Once you've made this change, rebuild your Docker image and run the container again. You should now be able to access the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.
