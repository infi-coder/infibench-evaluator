You can use the following code to copy text to the Windows clipboard in VBA:

```
Dim MyData As DataObject
Set MyData = New DataObject
MyData.SetText "textValue"
MyData.PutInClipboard
```

Replace "textValue" with the actual text you want to copy. This should work even if the object is a node in a tree.
