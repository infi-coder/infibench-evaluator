This warning message is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled, which means that your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone without authentication. 

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch security features by following the instructions provided in the warning message. You can do this by setting up a minimal security setup for Elasticsearch. 

Here are the steps to enable Elasticsearch security features:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file located at `config/elasticsearch.yml`.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

   ```
   xpack.security.enabled: true
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode: certificate
   ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After restarting Elasticsearch, you should no longer see the warning message.
