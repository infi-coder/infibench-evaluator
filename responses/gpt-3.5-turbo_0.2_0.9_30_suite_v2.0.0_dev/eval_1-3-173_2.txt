Yes, you can use the `date_range` function from pandas to create a range of dates for the given year and then calculate the length of the range to get the total number of days in the year. Here's the implementation of the `DaysInYear` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def DaysInYear(year):
    start_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-01-01')
    end_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-12-31')
    days_in_year = len(pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date))
    return days_in_year
```

This function takes the year as an argument, creates a start date and an end date for the year, and then uses `pd.date_range` to create a range of dates between the start and end dates. Finally, it returns the length of the range, which is the total number of days in the year.
