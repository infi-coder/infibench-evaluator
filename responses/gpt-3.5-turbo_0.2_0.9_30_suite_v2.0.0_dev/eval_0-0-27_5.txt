The issue might be related to the network configuration of your app. The URI you are using in your `ApolloClient` configuration is a sandbox URI provided by Apollo, which might not work in your environment. 

You can try changing the URI to a different GraphQL endpoint that you have access to. For example, you can use the following URI:

```
https://countries.trevorblades.com/
```

This is a public GraphQL API that provides information about countries. You can modify your `ApolloClient` configuration to use this URI:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://countries.trevorblades.com/',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

Then, modify your `EXCHANGE_RATES` query to use the `countries` field provided by this API:

```javascript
const EXCHANGE_RATES = gql`
    query GetExchangeRates {
        countries {
            code
            name
            native
            emoji
            currency
        }
    }
`;
```

This should allow you to fetch data successfully.
