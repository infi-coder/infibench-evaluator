You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by setting the `SortIncludes` option to `false`. 

To do this, create a `.clang-format` file in the root directory of your project (if you don't have one already) and add the following line to it:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the automatic sorting of includes in clang-format. You can still use clang-format to format your code, but it will not reorder your includes.

Note that disabling the sorting of includes may make your code less readable and harder to maintain. It's generally a good practice to keep your includes organized and sorted in a consistent way. If you're having trouble with the order of your includes, it may be worth taking the time to establish a standard order and enforcing it across your team.
