The error message "419 Page Expired" usually occurs when the CSRF token has expired. This token is used to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks and is generated by Laravel for each session. 

To avoid this error message, you can try the following solutions:

1. Increase the session timeout: You can increase the session timeout in the `config/session.php` file. By default, the session timeout is set to 120 minutes. You can increase this value to a higher number to avoid the session from expiring too soon.

2. Use AJAX requests: Instead of using regular form submissions for logout, you can use AJAX requests to send the logout request to the server. This way, the CSRF token will be refreshed automatically, and you won't get the "419 Page Expired" error message.

3. Use a JavaScript library: You can use a JavaScript library like Axios or jQuery to handle the logout request. These libraries can automatically add the CSRF token to the request headers, and you won't have to worry about the token expiring.

4. Use a package: There are several Laravel packages available that can handle CSRF token refresh automatically. One such package is `laravel-csrf-token-refresh`. You can install this package and configure it to automatically refresh the CSRF token on each request.
