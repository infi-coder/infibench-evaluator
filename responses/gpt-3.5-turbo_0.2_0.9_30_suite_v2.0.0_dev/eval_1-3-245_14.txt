It seems that the Dockerfile is not able to find the `app` module. You can try the following steps to revise your Dockerfile:

1. Make sure that the `app` folder is in the same directory as the Dockerfile.

2. Update the `COPY` command in the Dockerfile to copy the `app` folder to the working directory:

   ```
   COPY ./app /app
   ```

3. Update the `CMD` command to use the correct path to the `main` module:

   ```
   CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
   ```

Here is the updated Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /
RUN pip install --requirement /requirements.txt

COPY ./app /app

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

Make sure to rebuild the Docker image and run the container again using `docker-compose up -d`.
