Sure! The code you provided is almost correct, but it has a small error. The correct definition of `FruitsAndColors` would be:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This creates an intersection type between two objects, one with the numeric properties for each fruit and another with the boolean properties for each color.
