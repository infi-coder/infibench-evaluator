The "f" in `print(f"...")` is used to create a formatted string literal in Python. This is also known as an f-string. 

An f-string is a string literal that is prefixed with the letter "f" or "F". It allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {}. The expressions inside the curly braces are evaluated at runtime and their values are inserted into the string.

In your example, the expressions inside the curly braces are `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory`. These expressions are evaluated at runtime and their values are inserted into the string.

So, the output of the `print` statements will be a string that includes the values of `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` in the appropriate places.
