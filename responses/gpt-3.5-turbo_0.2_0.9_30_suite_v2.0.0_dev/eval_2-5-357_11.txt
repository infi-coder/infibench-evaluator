Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended approach because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly shows the dependencies required by the class and ensures that they are properly initialized before the object is used. Additionally, it makes the class immutable, which is a good practice for writing clean and testable code. However, if you prefer to use setter injection or field injection, you can still do that in Spring.
