Here's the revised code for the `pig_latin` function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
  words = text.split()
  pig_latin_words = []
  for word in words:
    endString = word[1:].lower()
    firstLetter = word[0].lower()
    pig_latin_words.append(endString + firstLetter + 'ay')
  return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)
```

The changes made are:

- Instead of initializing `say` to an empty string, we initialize an empty list `pig_latin_words`.
- We loop through each word in `words` and perform the pig Latin transformation on each word.
- We append the transformed word to `pig_latin_words`.
- Finally, we join the words in `pig_latin_words` with a space and return the resulting string.

With these changes, the function should now correctly transform the input text into pig Latin.
