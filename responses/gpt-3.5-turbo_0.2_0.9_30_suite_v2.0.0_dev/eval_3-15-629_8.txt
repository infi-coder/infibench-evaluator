You can use the following code to copy text to the Windows clipboard in VBA:

```
Dim MyData As DataObject
Set MyData = New DataObject
MyData.SetText "textValue"
MyData.PutInClipboard
```

This will copy the text "textValue" to the clipboard. Make sure to add a reference to the "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library" in your VBA project.
