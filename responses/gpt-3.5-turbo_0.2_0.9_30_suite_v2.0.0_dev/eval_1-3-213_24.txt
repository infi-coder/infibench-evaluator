You can try using the `tz_localize` method to set the timezone to None and then use the `tz_convert` method to convert it to the desired timezone. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
df['time'] = df['time'].dt.tz_localize(None).dt.tz_convert('UTC')
```

This will remove the timezone information from the "time" column and convert it to UTC timezone. You can replace 'UTC' with the desired timezone.

Here's the complete `removeTimezone` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def removeTimezone(df):
    df['time'] = df['time'].dt.tz_localize(None)
    return df
```

You can call this function with your DataFrame as the argument and it will return the modified DataFrame with the timezone information removed from the "time" column.
