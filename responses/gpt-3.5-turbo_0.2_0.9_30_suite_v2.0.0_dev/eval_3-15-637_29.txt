The issue you are facing could be due to the incompatibility of the Selenium WebDriver with the version of Internet Explorer installed on your machine. 

Excel 2019 comes with Internet Explorer 11, which is not fully compatible with the latest version of Selenium WebDriver. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Install the latest version of Selenium WebDriver from the official website.
2. Use a different browser like Chrome or Firefox instead of Internet Explorer.
3. Use an older version of Internet Explorer that is compatible with Selenium WebDriver.

If none of the above solutions work, you can try using a different version of Excel or downgrade to an older version of Internet Explorer.
