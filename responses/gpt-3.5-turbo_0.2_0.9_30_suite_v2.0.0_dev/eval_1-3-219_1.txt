There are a few things you can try to solve this issue:

1. Make sure that the Jupyter extension is installed in VS Code. You can check this by going to the Extensions tab on the left-hand side of the VS Code window and searching for "Jupyter".

2. Check that the correct Python interpreter is selected in VS Code. You can do this by clicking on the bottom left-hand corner of the VS Code window where it says "Python 3.x.x" and selecting the correct interpreter.

3. Try running Jupyter notebook outside of VS Code to see if it works there. Open a command prompt or terminal window and activate your virtual environment by running `conda activate da38`. Then run `jupyter notebook` and see if it launches successfully.

4. If none of the above solutions work, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling both VS Code and Miniconda. Make sure to completely remove all files associated with both programs before reinstalling.

Hopefully one of these solutions will work for you.
