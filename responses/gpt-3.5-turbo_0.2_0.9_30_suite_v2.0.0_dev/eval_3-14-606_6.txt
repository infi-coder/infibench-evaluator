To enable developer mode on iOS 16.0, follow these steps:

1. Open the "Settings" app on your iOS device.
2. Scroll down and tap on "Developer".
3. Toggle the switch next to "Developer Mode" to the on position.
4. You may be prompted to enter your device passcode or Apple ID password.
5. Once enabled, you should be able to run the provisioned testing build without any issues.

Note: If you do not see the "Developer" option in your settings, it may be hidden. To unhide it, go to "Settings" > "General" > "About" and tap on the "Software Version" field repeatedly until the "Developer" option appears.
