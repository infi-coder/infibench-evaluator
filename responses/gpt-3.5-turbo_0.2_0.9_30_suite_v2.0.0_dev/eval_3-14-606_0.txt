Developer mode is not a feature that can be enabled on iOS 16.0. It is possible that the alert you received is related to the provisioning profile used to sign the app. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the provisioning profile used to sign the app is still valid. You can do this by going to Settings > General > Profiles & Device Management on your iOS device and checking if the profile is listed and has not expired.

2. If the profile is expired or missing, you will need to obtain a new one from the developer who created the app.

3. If the profile is valid, try restarting your device and then attempting to open the app again.

4. If the issue persists, you may need to contact the developer of the app for further assistance.
