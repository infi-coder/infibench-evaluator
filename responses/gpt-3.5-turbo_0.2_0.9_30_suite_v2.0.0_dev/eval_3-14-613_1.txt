This error message suggests that the preview code is not associated with any target in the current scheme. You can try the following steps to fix the issue:

1. Make sure that the preview code is included in the target you are building. You can check this by selecting the file in the Project navigator and checking the Target Membership section in the File inspector.

2. Clean the build folder by selecting Product > Clean Build Folder from the menu bar.

3. Try restarting Xcode and rebuilding the project.

4. If the issue persists, try creating a new project and copying the preview code into it to see if it works there. This can help determine if the issue is specific to your project or a general problem with Xcode.

Hopefully one of these steps will help resolve the issue with SwiftUI previews in Xcode.
