You can use the `torch.unsqueeze()` function to add a new dimension to the tensor `d` and then concatenate it with the tensor `inps` along the last dimension using the `torch.cat()` function. Here's the implementation of the `addTensor()` function:

```python
import torch

def addTensor(inps, d):
    # Add a new dimension to d
    d = torch.unsqueeze(d, dim=2)
    # Concatenate inps and d along the last dimension
    out = torch.cat((inps, d), dim=2)
    return out
```

You can call this function with your tensors `inps` and `d` as arguments to get the desired output tensor.
