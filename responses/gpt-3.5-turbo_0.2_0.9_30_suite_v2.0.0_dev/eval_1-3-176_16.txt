The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib first and then install Pillow again. Here are the steps:

1. Download the zlib library from the official website: https://www.zlib.net/
2. Extract the downloaded file and navigate to the extracted directory in the command prompt.
3. Run the following commands to build and install zlib:

   ```bash
   ./configure
   make
   make install
   ```

4. After installing zlib, try installing Pillow again using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```

This should resolve the issue and install Pillow successfully.
