You can use the Windows API to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. Here's an example code snippet that you can use:

```
Private Declare Function SHGetKnownFolderPath Lib "shell32.dll" (ByRef rfid As Any, ByVal dwFlags As Long, ByVal hToken As Long, ByRef pszPath As Any) As Long

Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrive As String = "{A52BBA46-E9E1-435f-B3D9-28DAA648C0F6}"
Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro As String = "{7A3B4ADD-CC5F-4EBA-9B8C-2F8A0B93EAF4}"
Private Const FOLDERID_OneDrive As String = "{018D5C66-4533-4307-9B53-224DE2ED1FE6}"

Public Function GetOneDriveFolderPath() As String
    Dim sPath As String
    Dim lResult As Long
    
    lResult = SHGetKnownFolderPath(StrPtr(FOLDERID_OneDrive), 0, 0, sPath)
    
    If lResult = 0 Then
        GetOneDriveFolderPath = sPath
    Else
        GetOneDriveFolderPath = ""
    End If
End Function
```

You can call this function to get the local path of the OneDrive folder and then use it to create folders and files on SharePoint using VBA.
