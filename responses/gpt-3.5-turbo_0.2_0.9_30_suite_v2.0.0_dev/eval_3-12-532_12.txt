The `FormatException: Unexpected character (at character 1)` error occurs when the JSON string being decoded is not in the correct format. In your case, it seems that the response body returned by the PHP file is not a valid JSON string.

To solve this error, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the response body returned by the PHP file by printing it to the console. You can do this by adding the following line of code after the `var response` declaration:

   ```dart
   print(response.body);
   ```

   This will print the response body to the console, which you can inspect to see if it is a valid JSON string.

2. If the response body is not a valid JSON string, you need to fix the PHP file to return a valid JSON response. You can use a JSON validator to check if the response body is valid or not.

3. If the response body is a valid JSON string, you can try using the `try-catch` block to catch the `FormatException` and handle it accordingly. You can modify your code as follows:

   ```dart
   try {
     List data = json.decode(response.body);
     // Handle the decoded data here
   } catch (e) {
     print('Error decoding JSON: $e');
     // Handle the error here
   }
   ```

   This will catch the `FormatException` and print the error message to the console. You can then handle the error accordingly.
