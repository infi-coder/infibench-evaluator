The issue you are facing might be due to the incompatibility of the Selenium WebDriver version with the Excel 2019 version. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium WebDriver installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Check if the Selenium WebDriver reference is added to your Excel VBA project. To do this, go to the VBA editor, click on Tools > References, and make sure that the Selenium Type Library is checked.

3. Try using a different browser driver. For example, if you were using the Internet Explorer driver, try using the Chrome driver instead.

4. Try running the code in compatibility mode. To do this, go to the Excel 2019 installation folder, right-click on the Excel.exe file, select Properties, go to the Compatibility tab, and check the box for "Run this program in compatibility mode for" and select the previous version of Excel that was working for you.

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try using a different version of Excel, or try running the code on a different machine with Excel 2013 installed.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue.
