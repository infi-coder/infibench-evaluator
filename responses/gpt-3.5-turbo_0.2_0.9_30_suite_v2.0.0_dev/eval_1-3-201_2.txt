One solution to this problem is to use multiprocessing instead of threading. Multiprocessing allows you to run multiple processes simultaneously, which can be useful when dealing with infinite loops. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use multiprocessing:

```python
from multiprocessing import Process

app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
database=db.dataBase()
homepage=hp.homepage(database)
homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()

def run_data_mining():
    while True:
        dataMiningScript.run()

def run_web_app():
    app.run_server(debug=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p1 = Process(target=run_data_mining)
    p2 = Process(target=run_web_app)
    p1.start()
    p2.start()
    p1.join()
    p2.join()
```

In this modified code, we define two functions `run_data_mining` and `run_web_app` that run the data mining script and the web app, respectively. We then create two `Process` objects and start them using the `start` method. Finally, we use the `join` method to wait for both processes to finish before exiting the program.

Note that you may need to modify the `run` method of your `financeData` class to include a sleep statement to avoid consuming too much CPU time.
