The error message "419 Page Expired" is related to the CSRF token. Laravel uses CSRF tokens to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks. When you log out from one tab, the CSRF token is invalidated and the other tab still has the old CSRF token. That's why you get the "419 Page Expired" error when you try to log out from the other tab.

To avoid this error message, you can add a check in your logout function to see if the CSRF token is valid. If it's not valid, you can regenerate the token and then log out the user. Here's an example:

```
public function logout(Request $request)
{
    if (!$request->session()->regenerateToken()) {
        // Failed to regenerate CSRF token
        return redirect()->back();
    }

    Auth::logout();

    return redirect('/');
}
```

This code regenerates the CSRF token and then logs out the user. If the CSRF token regeneration fails, it redirects back to the previous page. This way, you can avoid the "419 Page Expired" error and log out the user successfully.
