Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly indicates that the constructor requires a dependency to be injected, and it also ensures that the dependency is not null. Additionally, it allows for the class to be immutable, which can be beneficial for testing and thread-safety. However, if you prefer to use constructor injection without `@Autowired`, that is also a valid approach.
