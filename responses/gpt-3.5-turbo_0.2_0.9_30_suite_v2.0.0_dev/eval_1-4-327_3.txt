To select the second column with the name "a" in the data frame `d3`, you can use the indexing operator `[ ]` with the column name enclosed in quotes and preceded by a comma to indicate that you want to select all rows. Here's the code:

```r
second_col <- d3[, "a.1"]
```

This will select the second column with the name "a" and assign it to the variable `second_col`. Note that the column name is "a.1" because R automatically adds a suffix to duplicate column names to make them unique.
