Your `sed` command is not correctly removing the `?` and everything after it. Instead of `'s/\?.*//g'`, try using `'s/\?.*$//'`. This should remove the `?` and everything after it. Also, the `mv` command is not necessary since you are only renaming the file. You can use the `rename` command instead. Here's the updated command:

```
find . -type f -name '*\?*' -exec rename 's/\?.*$//' {} \;
``` 

This should remove the `?` and everything after it from all filenames that contain a `?`.
