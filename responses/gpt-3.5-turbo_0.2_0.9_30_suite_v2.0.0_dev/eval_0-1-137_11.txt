The issue is that you are missing a comma after the color value for the `primary` key in your `$theme-colors` map. Here's the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here,
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace `#your-color-here` with your desired color value. After making this change, try compiling your SCSS file again and the error should be resolved.
