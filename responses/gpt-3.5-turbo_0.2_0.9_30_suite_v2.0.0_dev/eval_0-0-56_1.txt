It seems that the issue is related to the way you are exposing the port in Docker. When you run the command `docker-compose run --publish 8080:8080 --rm app bash`, you are publishing the container's port 8080 to the host's port 8080. However, in your `vite.config.ts` file, you are setting the server port to 8080, which is the container's port.

To fix this issue, you can change the `server.port` property in your `vite.config.ts` file to 8081, for example:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        port: 8081 // change the port to 8081
    }
})
```

Then, update your `docker-compose.yml` file to publish the container's port 8081 to the host's port 8080:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  app:
    image: myapp
    build: .
    container_name: myapp
    ports:
      - "8080:8081" # publish container's port 8081 to host's port 8080
```

Finally, run the command `docker-compose up` to start the container and access your app at `localhost:8080` on your host machine.
