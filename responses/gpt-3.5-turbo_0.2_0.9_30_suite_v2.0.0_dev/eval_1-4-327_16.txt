To select the second column by name, you can use the `[[` operator with the column name enclosed in quotes. Here's the code to select the second column of `d3` by name and assign it to a variable named `second_col`:

```r
second_col <- d3[["a.1"]]
```

Note that the second column has a modified name `a.1` to avoid having two columns with the same name.
