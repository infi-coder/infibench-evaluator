This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, which is a language server for Rust. It is a known issue and has been reported on GitHub. 

The error message is related to the `format_args!` macro, which is used internally by Rust to format strings. The macro is not being resolved correctly by rust-analyzer, which is causing the error.

Fortunately, this error does not affect the functionality of your code, and it should still work correctly. You can safely ignore the error for now.

If you want to get rid of the error message, you can try updating rust-analyzer to the latest version or disabling it temporarily. You can also try using a different IDE or editor that supports Rust, such as Visual Studio Code with the Rust extension.
