It seems that there is a conflict between the version of Hibernate Validator that is included in your project and the one that is being used by JBoss. 

You can try excluding the Hibernate Validator dependency from your project and let JBoss use its own version. To do this, add the following exclusion to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

This will exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from the spring-boot-starter-validation, which is the one that is causing the conflict.

Alternatively, you can try upgrading the version of Hibernate Validator in your project to match the one used by JBoss. You can do this by adding the following dependency to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.5.Final-redhat-2</version>
</dependency>
```

This will force your project to use the same version of Hibernate Validator as JBoss.
