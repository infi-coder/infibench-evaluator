Yes, Tailwind CSS has a `last` pseudo-class variant that can be used to target the last element in a list. You can use it to remove the border from the last `li` element.

Here's the revised code:

```html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="(item, index) in items"
    :key="`item-${index}`"
    class="border-solid border-b border-black {{ index === items.length - 1 ? '' : 'pb-4' }}"
  >
    Item
  </li>
</ul>
```

In this code, we're using the `pb-4` utility class to add a bottom padding to all `li` elements except the last one. We're also using the `last` pseudo-class variant to remove the border from the last `li` element.

Note that we're using the ternary operator to conditionally apply the `pb-4` class based on whether the current `li` element is the last one or not.
