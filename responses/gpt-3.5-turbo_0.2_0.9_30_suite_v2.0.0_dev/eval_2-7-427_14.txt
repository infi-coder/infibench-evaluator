For the first question, the issue could be related to the session driver configuration on the host domain. Make sure that the session driver is set to the same value as the one used locally. Also, check if the session cookie domain is set correctly in the `.env` file. If the domain is not set correctly, it can cause multiple sessions to be created for the same user.

For the second question, the error message suggests that the SSL version used by the server is not compatible with the one used by the client. Try changing the encryption type to `tls` instead of `ssl` in the `.env` file and in the `mail.php` configuration file. If that doesn't work, try using port 465 instead of 587. Also, make sure that the email account credentials are correct and that the email server allows SMTP connections from your server.
