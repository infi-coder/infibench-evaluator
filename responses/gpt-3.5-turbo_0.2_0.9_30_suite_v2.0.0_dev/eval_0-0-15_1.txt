To mock a class with Jest, you can use the `jest.mock` function and return a constructor function that creates an object with the desired methods. Here's how you can modify your code to eliminate the `TypeError`:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {
      someMethod: jest.fn()
    };
  });
});

const api = new API();
```

In this code, we're returning a constructor function from the `jest.mock` call, which creates an object with a `someMethod` method. We're also using the `jest.fn()` function to create a mock function for `someMethod`.

When you call `new API()`, Jest will use the mocked constructor function to create a new object with the mocked `someMethod` function.
