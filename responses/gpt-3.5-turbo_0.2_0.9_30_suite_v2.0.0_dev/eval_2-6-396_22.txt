The error message is caused by the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` in your `OnModelCreating` method. This line is trying to create an index on the `Gender` property of the `User` entity, but `Gender` is a navigation property and cannot be used as a property in this context.

To fix this error, you can remove the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` from your `OnModelCreating` method. This line is not necessary for your code to work correctly, as the foreign key relationship between `User` and `Gender` will already create an index on the `GenderId` property.

Your updated `OnModelCreating` method should look like this:
```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);
    }
}
```
