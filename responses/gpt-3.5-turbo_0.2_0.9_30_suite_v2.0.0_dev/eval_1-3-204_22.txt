The issue with your code is that the `rename()` method is used to rename the index or column labels of a DataFrame. In your case, you want to rename a column, so you should use the `rename()` method on the DataFrame itself.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
avg = df.groupby("t", sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index().rename(columns={"p": "mean"})
```

In this code, we first group the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column. Then we reset the index to turn the "t" column back into a regular column, and finally, we rename the "p" column to "mean".

Here's the `renameDataFrame` function:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby("t", sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index().rename(columns={"p": "mean"})
    return avg
```

You can call this function with your DataFrame as the argument, and it will return the DataFrame with the "p" column renamed as "mean" and the average calculated group by "t" column.
