Enzyme has not yet released an official adapter for React 17. However, you can use the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package as an alternative. Here's how you can adapt your code snippet to use this adapter:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Note that you will need to install the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package separately using a package manager like npm or yarn.
