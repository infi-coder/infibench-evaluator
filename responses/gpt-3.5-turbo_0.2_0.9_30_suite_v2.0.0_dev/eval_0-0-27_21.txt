It seems that the issue is related to the network connection. The `uri` you are using in `ApolloClient` is not working. 

You can try changing the `uri` to a working GraphQL endpoint. For example, you can use the following `uri`:

```
https://countries.trevorblades.com/
```

This is a public GraphQL API that provides information about countries. You can test it by running the following query in your browser:

```
https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql
```

```
query {
  countries {
    code
    name
    native
    emoji
    currency
    languages {
      code
      name
    }
  }
}
```

If the query returns data, then you can use this `uri` in your `ApolloClient` configuration. 

Also, make sure that your device or emulator is connected to the internet.
