To import images in a React component with TypeScript and Parcel, you need to do the following:

1. Create a `.d.ts` file with the same name as the image file, in the same directory as the image. For example, if your image is named `image.jpg`, create a file named `image.d.ts`.
2. In the `.d.ts` file, declare a module with the same name as the image file, and export a string with the path to the image. For example:

```
declare module '*.jpg' {
  const value: string;
  export default value;
}
```

3. In your component file, import the image using the path to the `.d.ts` file, not the path to the image itself. For example:

```
import * as React from 'react';
import image from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```

4. Make sure that the `.d.ts` file is included in your TypeScript configuration. In your `tsconfig.json` file, add the following line to the `"include"` array:

```
"include": [
  "src/**/*.ts",
  "src/**/*.tsx",
  "src/**/*.d.ts"
]
```

Note that the `.d.ts` file should not have the same name as your entry point file (`index.tsx` in your case), as TypeScript will ignore it and assume that it is generated from the entry point file. If you named your `.d.ts` file `index.d.ts`, rename it to something else (e.g. `image.d.ts`).
