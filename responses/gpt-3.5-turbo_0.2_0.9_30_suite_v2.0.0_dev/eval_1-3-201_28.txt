One solution to this problem is to use multiprocessing instead of threading. Multiprocessing allows you to run multiple processes in parallel, which can be useful when dealing with infinite loops. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use multiprocessing:

```python
import multiprocessing as mp

def run_data_mining(database):
    dataMiningScript = fd.financeData(database, 1600)

def run_webpage(database):
    app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
    homepage = hp.homepage(database)
    homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
    homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()
    app.run_server(debug=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    database = db.dataBase()
    p1 = mp.Process(target=run_data_mining, args=(database,))
    p2 = mp.Process(target=run_webpage, args=(database,))
    p1.start()
    p2.start()
    p1.join()
    p2.join()
```

In this example, we define two functions `run_data_mining` and `run_webpage`, which will be run in separate processes. We then create two `Process` objects `p1` and `p2`, which will run these functions. We start the processes using the `start` method, and then wait for them to finish using the `join` method.

Note that we pass the `database` object as an argument to both functions, so that they can share the same database instance. This is important, as otherwise they would be using separate database instances and would not be able to communicate with each other.

Also note that we do not need to use the `if __name__ == "__main__"` guard when using multiprocessing, as this is handled automatically by the `multiprocessing` module.
