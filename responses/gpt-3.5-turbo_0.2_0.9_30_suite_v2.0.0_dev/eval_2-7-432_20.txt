The error message "419 Page Expired" usually occurs when the CSRF token expires. This can happen when the user stays on the same page for too long, or when they have multiple tabs open with the same session.

To avoid this error message, you can add a check in your logout function to see if the CSRF token has expired. If it has, you can regenerate a new token and then log the user out.

Here's an example of how you can do this in Laravel:

```
public function logout(Request $request)
{
    if ($request->session()->regenerateToken()) {
        Auth::logout();
        $request->session()->invalidate();
    }

    return redirect('/');
}
```

This code regenerates the CSRF token, logs the user out, and then invalidates the session. This ensures that the user is logged out properly, even if the CSRF token has expired.

You can also add a message to let the user know that they have been logged out, so they don't get confused by the error message.
