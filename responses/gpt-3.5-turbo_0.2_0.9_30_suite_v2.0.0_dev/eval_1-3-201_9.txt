One solution to this problem is to use multiprocessing instead of threading. Multiprocessing allows you to run multiple processes simultaneously, which is useful when dealing with infinite loops.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use multiprocessing:

```python
from multiprocessing import Process

app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
database=db.dataBase()
homepage=hp.homepage(database)
homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()

def run_data_mining():
    dataMiningScript.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p1 = Process(target=run_data_mining)
    p1.start()
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

In this example, we define a new function `run_data_mining()` that simply calls the `run()` method of `dataMiningScript`. We then create a new process `p1` that runs this function using `Process(target=run_data_mining)`. Finally, we start the process using `p1.start()` and run the Dash app as usual.

Note that you may need to modify your `financeData` class to ensure that it can be run in a separate process. Specifically, you should avoid using global variables or shared state between processes, as this can lead to race conditions and other issues. Instead, consider using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms such as pipes or queues to exchange data between processes.
