You can use the following command to restart your current terminal session without closing the window on MacOS:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This will reload your updated `.bash_profile` file and apply any changes you made to it. 

Alternatively, you can use the `exec $SHELL` command to restart your terminal session, but this will close your current window and open a new one.
