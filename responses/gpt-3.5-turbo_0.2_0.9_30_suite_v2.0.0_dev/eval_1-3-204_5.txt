The issue with your code is that the `rename()` method is not applicable to a Pandas Series object, which is what you get when you call `.mean()` on a DataFrame column. Instead, you can use the `agg()` method to apply multiple aggregation functions to a DataFrame column and then rename the resulting columns.

Here's the modified code that should work:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
    avg = df.groupby("t", sort=False)["p"].agg(mean=("p", "mean")).reset_index()
    avg = avg.rename(columns={"mean": "p"})
    return avg
```

In this code, we first group the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column using the `agg()` method. The `agg()` method takes a dictionary of column names and aggregation functions as its argument. Here, we specify the name of the new column as "mean" and the aggregation function as "mean".

Next, we reset the index of the resulting DataFrame using the `reset_index()` method. This is necessary because the `agg()` method returns a DataFrame with a multi-level column index.

Finally, we rename the "mean" column to "p" using the `rename()` method and return the resulting DataFrame.

Note that I have assumed that the variable `datafile` is defined somewhere else in your code. If not, you will need to provide the file path as an argument to the function.
