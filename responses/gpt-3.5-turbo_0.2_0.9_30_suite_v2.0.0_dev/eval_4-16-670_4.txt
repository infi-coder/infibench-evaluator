Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Type the following command and press Enter:
```
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
3. You will be prompted to enter your passphrase (if you have one). Enter it and press Enter.
4. You will then be prompted to enter a new passphrase (if you want to change it). You can also press Enter to keep the same passphrase.
5. Your private key will now be converted to RSA format and saved to `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (the same file as before).

As for your second question, you do not need to transfer your `id_rsa.pub` file as it is simply the public key that corresponds to your private key. The server administrator should already have this file.
