To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to do the following:

1. Update your project to use Android Studio 4.2 or later.
2. Add the following lines to your app's build.gradle file:

```
android {
    ...
    buildFeatures {
        compose true
    }
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:1.0.0"
    ...
}
```

3. Sync your project with Gradle.

After these steps, you should be able to start using Jetpack Compose in your existing project.
