It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is present in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is not present in the cache, you can try running `go get` to download it:

   ```bash
   go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

2. Check if there are any network issues preventing the module from being downloaded. You can try running `go get` with the `-v` flag to see more verbose output:

   ```bash
   go get -v github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   This will show you the network requests being made by the `go` command. If there are any errors or timeouts, it could indicate a network issue.

3. Check if there are any authentication issues preventing the module from being downloaded. You can try running `go get` with the `-insecure` flag to bypass certificate verification:

   ```bash
   go get -insecure github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   If this works, it could indicate that there is an issue with the SSL certificate on the server hosting the module.

4. Check if there are any issues with the `go.mod` file. You can try running `go mod verify` to check if the `go.mod` file is valid:

   ```bash
   go mod verify
   ```

   If there are any errors, it could indicate that the `go.mod` file is not correctly specifying the dependencies.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you debug the issue and get the module downloaded to the module cache on computer B.
