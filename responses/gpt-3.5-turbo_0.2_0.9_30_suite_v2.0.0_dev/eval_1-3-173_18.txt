Yes, you can use the `date_range` function from Pandas to generate a range of dates for the given year and then calculate the length of the range to get the total number of days in the year. Here's an implementation of the `DaysInYear` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def DaysInYear(year):
    start_date = pd.to_datetime(f"{year}-01-01")
    end_date = pd.to_datetime(f"{year}-12-31")
    days_in_year = len(pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date))
    return days_in_year
```

This function takes the year as an argument, converts the start and end dates of the year to datetime objects using `pd.to_datetime`, generates a range of dates using `pd.date_range`, and then calculates the length of the range using `len` to get the total number of days in the year.
