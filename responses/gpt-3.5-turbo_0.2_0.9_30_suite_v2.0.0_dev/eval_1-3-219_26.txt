Here are a few steps you can try to solve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Python extension installed in VS Code. You can check this by going to the Extensions tab and searching for "Python". If there is an update available, install it and restart VS Code.

2. Check that the correct Python interpreter is selected in VS Code. You can do this by clicking on the bottom left corner of the VS Code window where it says the name of the current interpreter. Make sure that the interpreter you want to use is selected.

3. Try launching Jupyter Notebook from the command line outside of VS Code. Open a terminal window and activate your virtual environment by running `conda activate da38`. Then run the command `jupyter notebook` and see if it launches successfully. If it does, try launching it again from within VS Code.

4. If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling both VS Code and Miniconda. Make sure to completely remove all files associated with both programs before reinstalling.

Hopefully one of these steps will solve your issue.
