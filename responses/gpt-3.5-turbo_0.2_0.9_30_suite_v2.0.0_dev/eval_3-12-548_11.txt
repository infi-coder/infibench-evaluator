To disable the back button in Flutter when you have reached the login page after logging out, you can use the `pushReplacement` method of the `Navigator` class. This method replaces the current route with a new route, and prevents the user from navigating back to the previous route using the back button.

Here's an example:

```
Navigator.pushReplacement(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => LoginPage()),
);
```

In this example, `LoginPage` is the new route that replaces the current route. When the user logs out and navigates to this page, the `pushReplacement` method is called to replace the current route with the `LoginPage`. This prevents the user from navigating back to the previous page using the back button.

Note that you can also use the `pushNamedAndRemoveUntil` method to achieve the same result. This method allows you to remove all previous routes from the stack and replace them with a new route.
