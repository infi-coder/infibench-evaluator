To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to define a `fill` method that takes a `ContentShape` and a `View` as parameters. Here's an example:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        Color.red
    }
}

struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedView())
    }
}
```

In this example, `RedView` conforms to `ShapeStyle` by implementing the `makeBody` method. The `makeBody` method returns a `View` that will be used to fill the shape. In this case, it returns a `Color` view with the color red.
