The issue with your code is that you are missing a comma after the color value of the primary theme-color. Here's the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #some-color-here, // Add a comma here
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace `#some-color-here` with your desired color value.

Also, make sure that you have installed the required dependencies for Sass to work with Bootstrap. You can install them using the following command:

```
npm install bootstrap sass
```

After that, you can compile your SCSS file to CSS using the following command:

```
sass style.scss custom.css
```

This should compile your SCSS file without any errors.
