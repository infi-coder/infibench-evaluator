This error occurs because pdftk is a 32-bit application and Catalina only supports 64-bit applications. One solution is to install a 64-bit version of pdftk. Here are the steps to install pdftk using Homebrew:

1. Install Homebrew by running the following command in Terminal:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

2. Install pdftk by running the following command in Terminal:

```
brew install pdftk-java
```

3. After installation, you can run pdftk by typing the following command in Terminal:

```
pdftk
```

This should solve the "pdftk: Bad CPU type in executable" error on your Mac.
