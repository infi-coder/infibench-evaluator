The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you will not have access to this attribute. 

To use `[Keyless]`, make sure you have updated to Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later. You can update your project's EF Core version by updating the corresponding NuGet package. 

If you have already updated to EF Core 5.0 or later and are still not seeing the `[Keyless]` attribute, make sure you have the correct namespace imported. The `[Keyless]` attribute is located in the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace, so make sure you have the following using statement at the top of your file:

```c#
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

If you still cannot access the `[Keyless]` attribute, try cleaning and rebuilding your solution to ensure that all dependencies are up to date.
