The issue is that you are missing a comma after the color value for the "primary" key in your `$theme-colors` map. Here's the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here,
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace `#your-color-here` with the actual color value you want to use for the primary color.

Also, make sure that you are compiling the SCSS file to CSS using the correct command. In your case, the correct command would be:

```
sass style.scss custom.css
```

This will compile the `style.scss` file to `custom.css`.
