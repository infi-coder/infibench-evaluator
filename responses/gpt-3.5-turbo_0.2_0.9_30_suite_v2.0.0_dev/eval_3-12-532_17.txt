The `FormatException` is thrown when the JSON string returned by the PHP file is not in the correct format. To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the JSON string returned by the PHP file using a tool like Postman or Insomnia. Make sure that the JSON string is valid and in the correct format.

2. Check the content type of the response returned by the PHP file. It should be `application/json`.

3. Make sure that the encoding used by the PHP file to return the JSON string is `utf-8`.

4. Check if the response body is not empty. If it is empty, then you will get a `FormatException`.

5. If the above steps do not solve the issue, you can try to catch the `FormatException` and print the response body to debug the issue. You can use the following code to catch the `FormatException`:

```dart
try {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} catch (e) {
  print(response.body);
}
```

This will print the response body to the console, which can help you identify the issue with the JSON string.
