Here is the bash script you can use to install Python 3.6.5 using brew:

```
brew install python@3.6
```

This will install Python 3.6.5 as the default Python 3 version. You can verify the installation by running the command `python3 --version`, which should output `Python 3.6.5`.

Note that you may need to update your PATH environment variable to use the newly installed version of Python 3.6.5.
