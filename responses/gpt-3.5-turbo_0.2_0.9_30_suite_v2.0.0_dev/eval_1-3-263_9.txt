The "f" in `print(f"...")` is used to format strings in Python. This is called an f-string or formatted string literal. 

In the example you provided, the curly braces `{}` are used to insert the values of the variables `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` into the string. The `f` before the string indicates that it is a formatted string and the variables inside the curly braces will be evaluated and replaced with their values.

For example, if `args.input_directory` is equal to `"input_files"` and `args.output_directory` is equal to `"output_files"`, the output of the two print statements would be:

```
Input directory: input_files
Output directory: output_files
``` 

This is a more concise and readable way of formatting strings compared to using the `%` operator or the `str.format()` method.
