The issue with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, which is not what you want. Instead, you should check if all characters in the input string are in the `correct` string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)
```

This function uses the `all()` function to check if all characters in the input string are in the `correct` string. It returns `True` if all characters are valid, and `False` otherwise.

You can call this function like this:

```python
text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Invalid input")
```
