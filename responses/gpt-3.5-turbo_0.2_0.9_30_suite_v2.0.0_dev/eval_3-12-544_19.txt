This error occurs when the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` method returns null. This can happen if the path_provider package is not properly initialized.

To fix this, make sure that you have added the path_provider package to your `pubspec.yaml` file and have run `flutter pub get` to download the package.

If you have already done this, try running `flutter clean` and then `flutter pub get` to clear any cached dependencies and rebuild the project.

If the issue persists, try adding a try-catch block around the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` method to handle any exceptions that may be thrown:

```dart
void main() async {
  try {
    final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
    runApp(MyApp());
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error getting application documents directory: $e');
  }
}
```

This will help you identify any errors that may be occurring during the initialization process.
