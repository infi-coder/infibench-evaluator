You can use the following code to copy text to the Windows clipboard in VBA:

```
Dim objClipboard As MSForms.DataObject
Set objClipboard = New MSForms.DataObject
objClipboard.SetText "textValue"
objClipboard.PutInClipboard
```

Make sure to add a reference to "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library" in your VBA project.
