The error message suggests that there is an issue with the quotes in the command. You can try escaping the quotes in the command by adding a backslash before each quote. Here's an example of how you can modify the command:

```
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "\"\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd\" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path=\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar\" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install\""
```

Alternatively, you can try running the command directly in the command prompt without using NetBeans. This will help you identify if the issue is with the command or with NetBeans. If the command works fine in the command prompt, then the issue is likely with NetBeans. In that case, you can try reinstalling NetBeans or checking if there are any updates available.
