Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r'[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function first checks if the input string is empty, and if so, returns an empty string. Then, it splits the input string into words using the regular expression `[-_]` as the delimiter. The first word is added to the result string as is, and the remaining words are capitalized and concatenated to the result string. The `capitalize()` method capitalizes the first letter of each word, and the `join()` method concatenates the capitalized words without any delimiter.

You will also need to import the `re` module at the beginning of your code to use the `split()` method with a regular expression.
