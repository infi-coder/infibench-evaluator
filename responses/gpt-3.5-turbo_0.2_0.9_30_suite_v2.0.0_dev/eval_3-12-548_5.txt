To disable the back button in Flutter when you have reached the login page after logging out, you can use the `WillPopScope` widget. Wrap your login page with `WillPopScope` and set its `onWillPop` property to return a `Future.value(false)`. This will prevent the user from going back to the previous page using the back button. Here's an example:

```
WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () => Future.value(false),
  child: LoginPage(),
)
```

Note that this will only disable the back button on Android devices. On iOS devices, the back button will still be visible but it will be disabled.
