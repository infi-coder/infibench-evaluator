The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is because the file was built on a Windows platform and is not compatible with the Linux environment in which AWS Lambda runs.

To fix this issue, you need to build the executable file on a Linux environment or use a tool like `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o main main.go` to build the executable file for Linux on your Windows machine.

Here are the steps to build the executable file for Linux on Windows:

1. Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on your Windows machine.
2. Open the WSL terminal and navigate to your Go project directory.
3. Run the following command to build the executable file for Linux:

   ```
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o main main.go
   ```

   This command sets the `GOOS` environment variable to `linux` and the `GOARCH` environment variable to `amd64` to build the executable file for Linux.

4. Zip the `main` executable file and any other necessary files into a single archive.
5. Upload the archive to AWS Lambda and test the function again.

After following these steps, your Lambda function should be able to find the `main` executable file and execute it successfully.
