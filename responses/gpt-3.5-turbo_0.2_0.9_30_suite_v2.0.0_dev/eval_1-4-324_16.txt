You can use the `tidyr` package in R to split the comma and colon separated column into respective columns. Here's how you can do it:

```r
library(tidyr)

mySplit <- function(df) {
  df %>%
    separate(col1, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = ",") %>%
    separate(name, into = c("name", "value"), sep = ":") %>%
    separate(Age, into = c("Age", "value"), sep = ":") %>%
    separate(City, into = c("City", "value"), sep = ":") %>%
    select(-value)
}
```

In the above code, we first use the `separate()` function to split the `col1` column into three separate columns `name`, `Age`, and `City` using `,` as the separator. Then we use the `separate()` function again to split the `name`, `Age`, and `City` columns into two separate columns each using `:` as the separator. Finally, we remove the `value` columns using the `select()` function.

You can call this function by passing your data frame `df` as an argument:

```r
result <- mySplit(df)
```

This will return a data frame with three columns `name`, `Age`, and `City` as shown in your desired output.
