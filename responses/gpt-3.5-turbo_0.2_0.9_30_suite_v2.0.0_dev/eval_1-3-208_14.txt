The issue with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is present in the `correct` string, which is not what you want. Instead, you need to check if all the characters in the input string are present in the `correct` string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    for char in text:
        if char not in correct:
            return False
    return True
```

In this code, we loop through each character in the input string and check if it is present in the `correct` string. If any character is not present, we return `False`. If all characters are present, we return `True`.

You can call this function like this:

```python
text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```
