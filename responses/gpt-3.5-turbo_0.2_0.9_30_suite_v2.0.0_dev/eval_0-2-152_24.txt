You need to use the `toast()` method to show the toast. Here's an example:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast with the default animation. You can also pass options to the `toast()` method to customize the animation and duration of the toast. For example:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast({
  animation: true,
  autohide: true,
  delay: 5000
}).toast('show');
```

This will show the toast with animation, autohide after 5 seconds, and a delay of 5000 milliseconds before showing the toast.
