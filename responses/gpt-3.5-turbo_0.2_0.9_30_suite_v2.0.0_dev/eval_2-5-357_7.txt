Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly indicates that the class has a dependency on another class, and it ensures that the dependency is satisfied before the class is used. Additionally, it makes the class easier to test, as you can easily create a mock object of the dependency and pass it to the constructor. However, it is not mandatory to use `@Autowired` on the constructor, and you can still use setter injection or field injection if you prefer.
