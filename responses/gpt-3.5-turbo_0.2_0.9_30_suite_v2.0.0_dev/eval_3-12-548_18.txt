To disable the back button in Flutter when you have reached the login page after logging out, you can use the `WillPopScope` widget. Wrap your login page with `WillPopScope` and set the `onWillPop` property to return a `Future.value(false)` to prevent the user from going back. Here's an example:

```
WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () => Future.value(false),
  child: LoginPage(),
)
```

This will disable the back button on Android and prevent the user from swiping back on iOS. It's a better solution than using `Navigator.pop(context)` or `Navigator.of(context).pop()` because it prevents the user from accidentally going back to a previous page.
