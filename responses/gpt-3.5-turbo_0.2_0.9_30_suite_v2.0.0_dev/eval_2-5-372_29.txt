It seems that you have a version conflict between the Hibernate Validator version that is included in your JBoss server and the one that is included in your Maven dependencies. 

You can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from your Spring Boot starter dependencies and add a specific version of Hibernate Validator that matches the one in your JBoss server. 

To do so, add the following exclusion to your `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency:

```xml
<exclusion>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
</exclusion>
```

Then, add the following dependency to your pom.xml, with the version that matches the one in your JBoss server:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.5.Final-redhat-2</version>
</dependency>
```

After that, try to rebuild and redeploy your application and see if the issue is resolved.
