To add Jetpack Compose to an existing project, you need to make sure that your project is using Android Studio 4.2 or later and that your project is targeting API level 21 or higher. Then, you can add the following dependencies to your app's build.gradle file:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.6.0'
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.1'
    implementation 'androidx.activity:activity-compose:1.3.1'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.1'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.1'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.runtime:runtime-livedata:1.0.1'
}
```

After adding the dependencies, you can start using Jetpack Compose in your project by creating Composable functions and using them in your UI. You can also convert your existing XML-based layouts to Compose-based layouts.
