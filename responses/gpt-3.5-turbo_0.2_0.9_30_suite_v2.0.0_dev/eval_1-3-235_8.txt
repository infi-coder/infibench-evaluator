The error occurs because some of the values in the "year" column are not integers but floats with a decimal point. To convert the column to integers, we need to remove the decimal point first. Here's a modified version of your code that should work:

```python
data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(str).str.split('.').str[0].astype(int)
```

This code converts the "year" column to a string, splits the string at the decimal point, takes the first part (before the decimal point), and then converts it to an integer.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(str).str.split('.').str[0].astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

You can call this function with your dataframe as an argument to get the transformed dataframe.
