The error message is indicating that you cannot use the `Gender` property as a regular property on the `User` entity because it is already configured as a navigation property. 

To fix this issue, you can remove the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` from your `OnModelCreating` method. This line is trying to create an index on the `Gender` property, but since it is a navigation property, it cannot be indexed directly. 

If you need to search for users based on their gender, you can create an index on the `GenderId` property instead. You can do this by adding the following line to your `OnModelCreating` method:

```
user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
``` 

This will create an index on the `GenderId` column in the `User` table, which will allow you to search for users based on their gender.
