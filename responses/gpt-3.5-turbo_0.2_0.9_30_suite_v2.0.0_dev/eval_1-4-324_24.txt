You can use the `tidyr` package in R to split the comma and colon separated column into respective columns. Here's the `mySplit` function that achieves this:

```r
library(tidyr)

mySplit <- function(df) {
  df %>%
    separate(col1, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = ",") %>%
    separate(name, into = c("name", "value"), sep = ":") %>%
    separate(Age, into = c("Age", "value"), sep = ":") %>%
    separate(City, into = c("City", "value"), sep = ":") %>%
    select(name, Age, City)
}
```

Here's how the function works:

- First, we use the `separate` function to split the `col1` column into three separate columns using the comma separator.
- Then, we use the `separate` function again to split each of the three columns into two separate columns using the colon separator.
- Finally, we select only the three columns we need (`name`, `Age`, and `City`) and return the resulting data frame.

You can call this function by passing your `df` data frame as an argument:

```r
result <- mySplit(df)
```

This will return a data frame with the desired output.
