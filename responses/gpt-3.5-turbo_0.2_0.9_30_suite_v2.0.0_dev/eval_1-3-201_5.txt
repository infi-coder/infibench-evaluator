One solution to this problem is to use multiprocessing instead of threading. Multiprocessing allows you to run multiple processes simultaneously, which can be useful when dealing with infinite loops.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use multiprocessing:

```python
from multiprocessing import Process

app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
database=db.dataBase()
homepage=hp.homepage(database)
homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()

def run_webpage():
    app.run_server(debug=True)

def run_data_mining():
    while True:
        # your data mining code here
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p1 = Process(target=run_webpage)
    p2 = Process(target=run_data_mining)
    p1.start()
    p2.start()
    p1.join()
    p2.join()
```

In this example, we define two functions `run_webpage` and `run_data_mining`, which will be run in separate processes. The `run_webpage` function simply runs the Dash app, while the `run_data_mining` function contains your data mining code.

We then create two `Process` objects, one for each function, and start them using the `start` method. Finally, we call the `join` method on each process to wait for them to finish.

Note that the `while True` loop in `run_data_mining` will run indefinitely, so you may want to add some kind of exit condition to stop the process when necessary.
