The issue is that `ContentView_Previews` is using `@State` instead of `@Binding`. Change `@State` to `@Binding` in `ContentView_Previews` and it should work as expected. Here's the corrected code:

```
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    @Binding static var selected: Bool = false

    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $selected)
    }
}
```
