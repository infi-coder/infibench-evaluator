This warning message is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Elasticsearch is warning you that without authentication, your cluster could be accessible to anyone. 

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here are the steps to enable security:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file located at `config/elasticsearch.yml`.
2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:

```
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After you have enabled security, you will need to create a user with the appropriate permissions to access Elasticsearch. You can follow the instructions in the Elasticsearch documentation to create a user with the appropriate permissions.

Note: If you are using a version of Elasticsearch prior to 7.8, you will need to install the X-Pack plugin to enable security.
