You can try using the following VBA code to get the local path of the OneDrive folder:

```
Sub GetOneDriveLocalPath()
    Dim objShell As Object
    Set objShell = CreateObject("Shell.Application")
    MsgBox objShell.Namespace(13).Self.Path
End Sub
```

This code uses the Windows Shell object to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. The `Namespace(13)` method returns the OneDrive folder, and the `Self.Path` property returns the local path.

Note that this code may not work if the OneDrive folder is not synced to the local machine or if the user has multiple OneDrive accounts.
