Sure! The code you provided is almost correct, but you need to use the `|` operator instead of `,` when defining the type `FruitsAndColors`. Here's the corrected code:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This creates a type that has a numeric property for each fruit and a boolean property for each color. The `&` operator combines the two mapped types into a single type.
