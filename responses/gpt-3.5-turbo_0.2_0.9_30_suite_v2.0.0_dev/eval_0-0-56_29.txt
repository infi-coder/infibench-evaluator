It seems like the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` which means it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0` which will make it available on all network interfaces.

To do this, you can modify the `server.host` option in your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  server: {
    port: 8080,
    host: '0.0.0.0'
  }
})
```

This will make the Vite server accessible from outside the Docker container.

Also, make sure that you are running the Vite server with the correct command inside the Docker container. You should use `npm run vite` instead of `vite`:

```bash
docker-compose run --publish 8080:8080 --rm app npm run vite
```

With these changes, you should be able to access the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.
