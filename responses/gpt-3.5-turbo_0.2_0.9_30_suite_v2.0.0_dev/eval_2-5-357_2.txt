Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly indicates that the class has a dependency on another class and that Spring should provide an instance of that dependency when creating an instance of the class. It also ensures that the dependency is not null, which can prevent potential NullPointerExceptions. Additionally, using constructor injection allows for immutable objects, which can be beneficial for testing and thread-safety. However, if you prefer to use setter injection or field injection, those options are still available in Spring.
