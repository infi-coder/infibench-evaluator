TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides pre-defined classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. It doesn't provide a way to select direct children of a specific class using a class-based selector like `div.section > div`.

However, you can achieve this using the `@layer` directive in TailwindCSS. The `@layer` directive allows you to define custom styles that can be used alongside the default TailwindCSS styles.

Here's an example of how you can define a custom style using the `@layer` directive to select direct children of a div with class "section":

```css
@layer components {
  .section > * {
    /* your styles here */
  }
}
```

In this example, the `@layer components` directive defines a new layer for custom styles. The `.section > *` selector selects all direct children of a div with class "section". You can then add your custom styles inside the curly braces.

After defining this custom style, you can use it in your HTML like this:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div>Direct child 1</div>
  <div>Direct child 2</div>
</div>
```

The custom style will be applied to the direct children of the div with class "section".
