To split the data into separate columns, you can use the `Split` function. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to split the `textline` into separate columns:

```
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitText() As String
    splitText = Split(textline, ",")
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitText(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitText(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitText(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitText(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitText(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This assumes that the data in `textline` is separated by commas. You can modify the delimiter used in the `Split` function based on the actual delimiter used in your data.
