To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to do the following:

1. Update your project to use Android Studio 4.2 or later.
2. Add the following dependencies to your app-level build.gradle file:
```
android {
    ...
    buildFeatures {
        compose true
    }
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:$compose_version"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material:material:$compose_version"
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:$compose_version"
    ...
}
```
3. Sync your project with Gradle.
4. Create a Composable function in your project and start using Jetpack Compose.

That's it! You can now use Jetpack Compose in your existing project.
