This error occurs when the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` method returns null. This can happen if the path_provider package is not properly initialized.

Make sure that you have added the path_provider package to your `pubspec.yaml` file and have run `flutter pub get` to install it.

Also, make sure that you have imported the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
```

If you have done all of the above and are still getting the error, try running `flutter clean` and then rebuilding your app.

If the error persists, try wrapping the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` method call in a try-catch block to handle the null value:
```dart
void main() async {
  try {
    final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
    runApp(MyApp());
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error getting application documents directory: $e');
  }
}
```
