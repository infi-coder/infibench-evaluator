There are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Make sure that the `@EnableSwagger2` annotation is present in your Spring Boot application. This annotation enables Swagger support in your application.

2. Check if the `@ComponentScan` annotation is scanning the package where your Swagger configuration is located. By default, Spring Boot scans all the packages under the main application class. If your Swagger configuration is in a different package, you need to add it to the `@ComponentScan` annotation.

3. Verify that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` property is not overridden in your application.properties file. By default, the path for the Swagger UI is `/swagger-ui.html`.

4. Check if the `springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled` property is set to `true` in your application.properties file. This property enables or disables the Swagger UI.

5. Make sure that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.version` property is set to the correct version of OpenAPI that you are using.

If none of these solutions work, you can try to debug your application to see if there are any errors or exceptions being thrown.
