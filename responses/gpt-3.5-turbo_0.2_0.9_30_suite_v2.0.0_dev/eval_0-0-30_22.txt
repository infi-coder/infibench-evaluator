Enzyme has not yet released an official adapter for React 17, but you can use the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package as an alternative. Here's how you can adapt your code snippet to work with React 17:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Make sure to install the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package as a dependency in your project before running your tests.
