With Font Awesome 5, you need to use the `font-weight` property instead of the `font-family` property. Here is the updated code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-weight: 900;
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

Note that you also need to specify the font weight (`900` in this case) and the font family (`Font Awesome 5 Free` in this case) in order for the icon to display correctly.
