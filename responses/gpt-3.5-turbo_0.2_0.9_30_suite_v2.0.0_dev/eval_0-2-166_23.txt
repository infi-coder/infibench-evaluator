TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides pre-defined classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. It doesn't provide a way to select direct children of an element like the CSS selector `div.section > div`. However, you can achieve the same result by using the `first-child` and `last-child` pseudo-classes.

For example, if you have the following HTML:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div>First child</div>
  <div>Second child</div>
  <div>Third child</div>
</div>
```

You can use the `first-child` and `last-child` classes to style the first and last child elements respectively:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="first-child">First child</div>
  <div>Second child</div>
  <div class="last-child">Third child</div>
</div>
```

And then define the styles for these classes in your TailwindCSS configuration:

```css
.first-child {
  margin-top: 0;
}

.last-child {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
```

This will give you the same result as using the CSS selector `div.section > div`.
