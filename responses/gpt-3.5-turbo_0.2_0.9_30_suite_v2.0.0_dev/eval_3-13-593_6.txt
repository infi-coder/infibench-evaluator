To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Android Studio installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Open your existing project in Android Studio.
2. In the `build.gradle` file of your app module, add the following dependencies:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.runtime:runtime:1.0.0'
}
```

3. Sync your project with Gradle.
4. In your activity or fragment, create a `setContent` block and use Compose functions to build your UI.

That's it! You can now use Jetpack Compose in your existing project.
