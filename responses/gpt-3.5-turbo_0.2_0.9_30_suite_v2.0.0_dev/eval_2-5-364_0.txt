You can specify the path to the Java executable that you want to use by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. 

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Determine the path to the Java executable that you want to use. You can do this by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   which java
   ```

   This will output the path to the Java executable.

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path to the Java executable. You can do this by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/java` with the path to the Java executable that you want to use.

3. Run the Maven wrapper command again. Maven will now use the Java executable that you specified in the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

Alternatively, you can also specify the path to the Java executable directly in the Maven command by using the `-Dmaven.compiler.executable` option. For example:

```
./mvnw -Dmaven.compiler.executable=/path/to/java clean install
```

Replace `/path/to/java` with the path to the Java executable that you want to use.
