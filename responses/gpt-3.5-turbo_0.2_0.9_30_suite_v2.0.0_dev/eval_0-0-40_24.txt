The error message you are seeing indicates that the shell is unable to find the `sh` interpreter that is required to run the `npm` command. This is likely due to the fact that the line endings in the `npm` script are in Windows format, which is not compatible with Linux.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the `npm` script in a text editor that supports Unix-style line endings (such as Notepad++).
2. Convert the line endings to Unix-style by selecting "Edit" > "EOL Conversion" > "Unix (LF)".
3. Save the file and try running the `npm` command again.

If this does not work, you can try reinstalling `npm` using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

This should install the latest version of `npm` and ensure that it is compatible with your system.
