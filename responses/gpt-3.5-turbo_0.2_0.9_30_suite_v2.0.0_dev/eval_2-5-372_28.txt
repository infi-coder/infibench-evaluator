It seems that there might be a version conflict between the Hibernate Validator version that is included in your Spring Boot parent pom and the version that is resolved by Maven. 

To solve this issue, you can try excluding the Hibernate Validator dependency from your Spring Boot parent pom and explicitly adding the version that you want to use in your project. 

Here's an example of how you can do this in your pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

This will exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from the Spring Boot starter validation and add the version that you want to use explicitly. 

After making these changes, try running your application again and see if the issue is resolved.
