It sounds like you may be trying to use a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less. These preprocessors allow you to write CSS in a more efficient and organized way, using variables, mixins, and other features. 

When you write `.classname` and then the class with the div appears, it's likely that the preprocessor is compiling that code into regular CSS. 

Make sure you have the preprocessor installed and set up correctly in your project. If you're still having trouble, double-check the syntax and make sure you're following the correct conventions for the preprocessor you're using.
