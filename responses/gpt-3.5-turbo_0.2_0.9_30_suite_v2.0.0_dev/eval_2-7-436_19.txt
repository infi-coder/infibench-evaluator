The error message suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, and Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. Check your PHP version: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   php -v
   ```

   If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you will need to upgrade it.

2. Check your PHP extensions: Laravel 9 requires some PHP extensions that may not be installed by default. You can check which extensions are required by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   composer create-project --no-install laravel/laravel blog "9.*"
   ```

   This will create a new Laravel 9 project without installing any dependencies. You can then check the `require` section of the `composer.json` file to see which PHP extensions are required.

   If any required extensions are missing, you will need to install them. The exact process will depend on your operating system and package manager.

3. Check your Composer version: Laravel 9 requires Composer 2.0 or higher. You can check your Composer version by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   composer -v
   ```

   If your Composer version is lower than 2.0, you will need to upgrade it.

Once you have resolved any compatibility issues, you should be able to run the `composer create-project` command again to create your Laravel 9 project.
