The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using a version of Entity Framework Core prior to 5.0, you will not have access to this attribute.

To use `[Keyless]`, you need to make sure that you are using Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later. You can check the version of Entity Framework Core that you are using by looking at the version number of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package in your project's dependencies.

If you are using a version of Entity Framework Core prior to 5.0, you can still create keyless entities by defining them as regular entities with no primary key and using the `HasNoKey()` method in your `OnModelCreating` method to configure them as keyless entities. For example:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<MyKeylessClass>().HasNoKey();
}
```

Then, you can use the `FromSqlRaw` method to query the keyless entity:

```c#
_context.Set<MyKeylessClass>().FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM MyKeylessTable");
```
