The issue with your script is that the variable `$searchT` is enclosed in single quotes within the `if` statement. This means that the variable is not being expanded and is being treated as a literal string. To fix this, you should use double quotes instead of single quotes.

Here's the corrected script:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

In this script, the variable `$searchT` is enclosed in double quotes within the `if` statement. This allows the variable to be expanded and the value of the variable is used as the search term for the `grep` command.
