The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib first and then install Pillow again. Here are the steps to install zlib:

1. Download the zlib source code from the official website: https://www.zlib.net/
2. Extract the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.
3. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted the zlib source code.
4. Run the following commands to build and install zlib:

   ```bash
   ./configure
   make
   make install
   ```

   Note: If you're using Windows, you may need to use a different command to configure zlib. Check the zlib documentation for more information.

5. Once zlib is installed, try installing Pillow again using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```

If you still encounter issues, you can try installing Pillow from a pre-built binary. You can download the appropriate binary for your system from the Pillow website: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#binary-installation.
