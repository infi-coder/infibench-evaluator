You can disable the animation in ViewPager2 by setting the `offscreenPageLimit` to 0. This will prevent ViewPager2 from preloading any pages and will show the new fragment immediately when the tab is clicked. Here's an example:

```
viewPager2.offscreenPageLimit = 0
```

You can also disable the animation by setting the `PageTransformer` to null:

```
viewPager2.setPageTransformer(null)
```
