If you want to use the same version of Java that works with the Maven task, you can specify the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the location of the JDK that Maven is using. 

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Find the location of the JDK that Maven is using. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   mvn -version
   ```

   Look for the `Java home` line in the output. It should look something like this:

   ```
   Java home: /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre
   ```

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the location of the JDK. In the example above, you would run the following command:

   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
   ```

   Note: If you are using Windows, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable by following these instructions: https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-the-java_home-variable-in-windows-8895.html

3. Run the Maven wrapper command again. It should now use the same version of Java that Maven is using.

   ```
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```
