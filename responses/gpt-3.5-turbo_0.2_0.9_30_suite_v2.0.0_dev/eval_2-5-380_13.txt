To use Swagger UI with Spring Boot, you need to make sure that you have the following:

1. The `@EnableSwagger2` annotation on your main Spring Boot application class. This annotation enables Swagger support in your application.

2. The `@Configuration` annotation on a separate class that extends `WebMvcConfigurationSupport`. This class is responsible for configuring the Swagger UI resources.

Here's an example of how your code should look like:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSwagger2
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}

@Configuration
public class SwaggerConfig extends WebMvcConfigurationSupport {
    @Override
    public void addResourceHandlers(ResourceHandlerRegistry registry) {
        registry.addResourceHandler("swagger-ui.html")
                .addResourceLocations("classpath:/META-INF/resources/");

        registry.addResourceHandler("/webjars/**")
                .addResourceLocations("classpath:/META-INF/resources/webjars/");
    }
}
```

Make sure that you have the correct version of the `springdoc-openapi-ui` dependency in your `pom.xml` file. You can check the latest version on the [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springdoc/springdoc-openapi-ui).
