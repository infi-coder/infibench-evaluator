The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` suggests that the package `aws-sdk-js` cannot be found in the registry. This could be due to a temporary issue with the registry or a problem with your network connection.

You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check if the package is available in the registry by visiting the package page on the npm website: https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk-js. If the package is not found, it might have been removed or renamed.

2. Check your network connection by running other commands that require internet access.

3. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and try running `npm install` again.

4. If the issue persists, try using a different registry by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/` and then running `npm install` again.

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file and then running `npm install` again.
