The error message you are getting indicates that there is an issue with the npm executable file. It seems like the file has Windows line endings (`^M`) instead of Unix line endings. 

You can try reinstalling npm using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

If that doesn't work, you can try manually removing and reinstalling npm:

```
sudo apt-get remove npm
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install npm
```

This should remove any existing npm installation and install a fresh copy.
