It seems like the issue is related to the URI you are using for your Apollo Client. The URI `https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io` is a demo server provided by Apollo Client, and it may not be working properly at the moment.

You should replace the URI with the endpoint of your GraphQL server. You can check if your GraphQL server is working properly by using a GraphQL client like GraphQL Playground or Altair.

If you don't have a GraphQL server, you can create a simple one using a service like Apollo Studio or Hasura. Once you have a GraphQL server running, replace the URI in your `ApolloClient` configuration with the endpoint of your server.

For example:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://my-graphql-server.com/graphql',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

Make sure to replace `https://my-graphql-server.com/graphql` with the actual endpoint of your GraphQL server.

Once you have updated the URI, try running your app again and see if it works.
