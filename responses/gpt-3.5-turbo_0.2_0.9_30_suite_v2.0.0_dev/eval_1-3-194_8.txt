To write a list of lists into an Excel file, we can use the `openpyxl` library in Python. Here's the implementation of the `writeExcel()` function:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    
    # create a new workbook
    workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()
    
    # select the active worksheet
    worksheet = workbook.active
    
    # write the data to the worksheet
    for row in new_list:
        worksheet.append(row)
    
    # save the workbook
    workbook.save(filename="data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new workbook using the `openpyxl.Workbook()` method, selects the active worksheet, and writes the data to the worksheet using a `for` loop. Finally, it saves the workbook with the filename "data.xlsx".
