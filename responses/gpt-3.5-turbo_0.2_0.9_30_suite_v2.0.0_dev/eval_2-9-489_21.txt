This warning message indicates that Elasticsearch built-in security features are not enabled, which means that your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone without authentication. To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch security features.

Here are the steps to enable Elasticsearch security features:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` in your Rails app.

2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:

   ```
   xpack.security.enabled: true
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
   ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

   If you're using Searchkick with Rails, you can restart Elasticsearch by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   bin/elasticsearch
   ```

   If you're using Elasticsearch as a standalone service, you can restart it using the appropriate command for your operating system.

4. Once Elasticsearch has restarted, you should see a message in the logs indicating that security features have been enabled.

   ```
   [INFO ][o.e.x.s.SecurityStatusChangeListener] [node-1] Cluster health status changed from [YELLOW] to [GREEN] (reason: [initializing security]).
   ```

   This indicates that Elasticsearch security features have been enabled.
