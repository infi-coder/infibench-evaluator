Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended approach in Spring because it ensures that the required dependencies are injected at the time of object creation. This approach also makes the code more readable and easier to maintain. Additionally, it helps to avoid any potential issues that may arise due to circular dependencies. However, if you prefer to use constructor injection without `@Autowired`, you can do so as well.
