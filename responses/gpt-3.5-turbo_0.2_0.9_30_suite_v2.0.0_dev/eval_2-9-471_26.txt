To import images in a React component with TypeScript and Parcel, you need to do the following:

1. Create a `.d.ts` file with the same name as the image file, e.g., `image.jpg.d.ts`. This file should contain the following code:

```typescript
declare module '*.jpg' {
  const value: any;
  export = value;
}
```

2. Place the `.d.ts` file in the same directory as the image file, e.g., `src/assets/image.jpg.d.ts`.

3. In your component file, import the image like this:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import image from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
  return <img src={image} alt="My Image" />;
}

export default Box;
```

Note that you don't need to include the `.d.ts` file in `tsconfig.json`. TypeScript will automatically pick it up because it has the same name as the image file.

If you still get the error `Cannot find module`, try restarting your development server. If that doesn't work, make sure that the file paths are correct and that the image file exists in the specified location.

Also, make sure that you don't have any other `.d.ts` files with the same name as the image file in your project. TypeScript is ignoring the `.d.ts` file you created because it assumes that it is generated from `index.tsx`, which is more likely to be up to date. Name your `.d.ts` file something else, e.g., `image.d.ts`.
