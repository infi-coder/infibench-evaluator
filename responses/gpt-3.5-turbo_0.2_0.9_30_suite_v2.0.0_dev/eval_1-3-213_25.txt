You can try using the `tz_localize` method to set the timezone to UTC and then use `tz_convert` to convert it to a timezone-unaware datetime object. Here's how you can modify your code to remove timezone from the "time" column:

```python
import pandas as pd

def removeTimezone(df):
    df['time'] = df['time'].dt.tz_localize(None).dt.tz_convert(None)
    return df
```

This function takes a DataFrame `df` as input, removes the timezone from the "time" column using `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` methods, and returns the modified DataFrame.

You can call this function before saving the DataFrame to Excel:

```python
df = removeTimezone(df)
writer = pd.ExcelWriter(arquivo+'.xlsx', engine='xlsxwriter')
df.to_excel(writer, header=True, index=False)
writer.save()
```

This should solve the issue of Excel not supporting datetime with timezone.
