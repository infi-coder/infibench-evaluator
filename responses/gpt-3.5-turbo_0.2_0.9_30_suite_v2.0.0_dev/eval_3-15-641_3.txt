You can use the Windows API function `SHGetKnownFolderPath` to retrieve the local OneDrive folder path. Here's an example code snippet:

```
Private Declare PtrSafe Function SHGetKnownFolderPath Lib "shell32.dll" (ByRef rfid As Any, ByVal dwFlags As Long, ByVal hToken As LongPtr, ByRef pszPath As Any) As Long

Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrive = "{A52BBA46-E9E1-435f-B3D9-28DAA648C0F6}"
Private Const FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro = "{7C9D8867-D853-4E60-841E-AB360140D6F4}"

Sub GetOneDriveFolderPath()
    Dim path As String
    Dim result As Long
    
    result = SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_SkyDrive, 0, 0, path)
    If result = 0 Then
        MsgBox "OneDrive folder path: " & path
    Else
        MsgBox "Failed to retrieve OneDrive folder path"
    End If
End Sub
```

This code retrieves the local OneDrive folder path using the `FOLDERID_SkyDrive` constant. If you're using OneDrive for Business, you can use the `FOLDERID_SkyDrivePro` constant instead.
