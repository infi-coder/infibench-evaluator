The error you are encountering is likely due to a compatibility issue between the Selenium VBA library and Excel 2019. Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium VBA library installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Check that the correct reference is selected in the VBA editor. To do this, go to Tools > References and make sure that the Selenium Type Library is selected.

3. Try running the code in a different browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, to see if the issue is specific to Internet Explorer.

4. Check that the correct version of the Internet Explorer driver is installed. You can download the latest version from the official Selenium website.

5. Try running the code on a different machine with Excel 2019 to see if the issue is specific to your machine.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to contact the Selenium VBA support team for further assistance.
