This error occurs because pdftk is a 32-bit application and macOS Catalina only supports 64-bit applications. Here are two possible solutions:

1. Use an alternative to pdftk: There are several alternatives to pdftk that are compatible with macOS Catalina, such as PDFsam Basic, PDFtk Server, and QPDF. You can try one of these alternatives instead of pdftk.

2. Use a virtual machine: You can use a virtual machine to run an older version of macOS that supports 32-bit applications. You can install pdftk on the virtual machine and use it from there. VirtualBox is a free and popular virtual machine software that you can use.

I hope this helps!
