The error message suggests that the response from the server is not in the expected JSON format. It seems like the response is starting with a '<' character, which indicates that it might be an HTML response instead of a JSON response.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the API endpoint `/api/Employee/Index` in a browser or a tool like Postman to see if it returns the expected JSON response.

2. If the API endpoint is returning an HTML response, you need to fix the API endpoint to return the expected JSON response.

3. If the API endpoint is returning the expected JSON response, you can try to specify the correct content type in the HTTP request. You can do this by adding the `RequestHeader` attribute to the `HttpGet` method in the API controller:

```c#
[HttpGet]
[Route("api/Employee/Index")]
[Produces("application/json")]
public IEnumerable<Employee> Index()
{
    return objemployee.GetAllEmployees();
}
```

4. If the content type is already specified correctly in the API endpoint, you can try to specify the content type explicitly in the HTTP request in the Blazor component:

```c#
empList = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<Employee[]>("/api/Employee/Index", new JsonSerializerOptions { PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true });
```

Note that the `GetFromJsonAsync` method is used instead of `GetJsonAsync`, and the `JsonSerializerOptions` parameter is used to specify the `PropertyNameCaseInsensitive` option. This option is needed because the default JSON serializer in .NET Core is case-sensitive, while the properties in your `Employee` class are likely to be in camel case.
