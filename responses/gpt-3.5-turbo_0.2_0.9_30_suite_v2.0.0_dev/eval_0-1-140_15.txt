With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for calling icons has changed. You can use the following code to call an icon in CSS:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

In this code, `font-family` is set to `"Font Awesome 5 Free"` to call the Font Awesome 5 Free font family. Additionally, `font-weight` is set to `900` to ensure that the icon is displayed correctly.
