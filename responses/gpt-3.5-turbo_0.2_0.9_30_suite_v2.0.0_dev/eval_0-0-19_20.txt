The error message indicates that npm is unable to find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the registry. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The package has been removed from the registry.
2. There is a temporary issue with the registry.
3. There is a problem with your internet connection.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the package is still available in the registry by visiting the package page on the npm website.
2. Try running `npm install` again after some time to see if the issue resolves itself.
3. Check your internet connection to ensure that it is stable and not blocking access to the registry.
4. If none of the above steps work, you can try clearing the npm cache by running `npm cache clean` and then running `npm install` again.

If the issue persists, you can try installing the package using a different registry or by downloading the package and installing it locally.
