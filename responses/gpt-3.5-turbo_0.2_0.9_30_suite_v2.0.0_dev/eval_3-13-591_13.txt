The reason why the log with value 2 is printed before the log with value 1 is because the `onItemSelectedListener` is triggered only when an item is selected in the spinner. Therefore, the code inside the `onItemSelectedListener` is executed after the function has already returned the initial value of `itemSelected`.

To fix this, you can change the return type of the function to `Unit` and use a callback to return the selected item. Here's an example:

```
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>, onItemSelected: (String) -> Unit) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            onItemSelected(itemSelected)
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated function, the `onItemSelected` parameter is a callback function that takes a `String` parameter. Inside the `onItemSelectedListener`, the selected item is passed to the `onItemSelected` callback.

To use this function, you can call it like this:

```
spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list) { selectedItem ->
    // Do something with the selected item
}
```

In the callback, you can perform any action that you want with the selected item.
