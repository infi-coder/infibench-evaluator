This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, a popular Rust language server. It is a false positive and does not indicate an actual error in your code. 

You can try updating rust-analyzer to the latest version, as this bug may have been fixed in a more recent release. Alternatively, you can ignore the error and continue working on your code, as it should not affect the functionality of your program.
