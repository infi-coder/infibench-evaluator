It seems like the preview code is not associated with any target in the current scheme. You can try the following steps to fix the issue:

1. Make sure that the preview code is included in the target you are building.
2. Clean the build folder by going to Product > Clean Build Folder.
3. Quit Xcode and try reopening the project.
4. If the issue persists, try creating a new project and copying the code over to see if the previews work in the new project.

Hopefully, one of these steps will resolve the issue.
