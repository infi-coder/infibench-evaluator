Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Run the following command to convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key:

```
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you to enter a new passphrase for your key. You can leave it blank if you don't want to set a new passphrase.

3. After running the command, your RSA private key will be saved in the same location as your original OpenSSH private key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

4. You can now use this RSA private key to access your server.

As for your second question, you don't need to transfer your `id_rsa.pub` file as it is just the public key that corresponds to your private key. The server administrator should already have your public key on their server.
