To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to define a type that conforms to both the `View` and `ShapeStyle` protocols. Here's an example:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func makeView() -> some View {
        Color.red
    }
    
    func inset(by amount: CGFloat) -> some ShapeStyle {
        self
    }
}
```

Then you can use it like this:

```
Circle()
    .fill(RedView())
```

This should resolve the error you're seeing.
