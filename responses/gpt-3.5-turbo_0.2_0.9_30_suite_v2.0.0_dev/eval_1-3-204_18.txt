The issue with your code is that the `rename()` method is not applicable to a Pandas Series object, which is what you get when you use the `mean()` method on a DataFrame. Instead, you can use the `to_frame()` method to convert the resulting Series object to a DataFrame and then use the `rename()` method on the DataFrame.

Here's the modified code that should work:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=datain, columns=["t", "p", "x", "y", "z"])
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().to_frame().rename(columns={"p": "mean"})
    return avg
```

In this code, we first group the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column. This gives us a Series object with the mean values. We then convert this Series object to a DataFrame using the `to_frame()` method and rename the column using the `rename()` method.

Finally, we return the resulting DataFrame.
