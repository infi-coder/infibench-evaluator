Yes, the above comment is true/correct. 

A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the object's properties and set its initial state. 

Unlike regular methods, constructors cannot be called directly like a function. They are invoked automatically when a new object is created using the `new` keyword. 

Therefore, it is not possible to call a constructor directly like a regular function.
