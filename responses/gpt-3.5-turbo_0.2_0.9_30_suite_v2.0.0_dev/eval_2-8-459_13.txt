It seems like the go module system is unable to download the dependency from the private repo. Here are a few things you can try to debug the issue:

1. Check if you have the correct permissions to access the private repo. You can try cloning the repo manually and see if you can access it.

2. Check if the dependency is listed in the go.mod file with the correct version. If not, you can try adding it manually and then running `go mod tidy` to update the go.sum file.

3. Check if the dependency is available in the module cache. You can try running `go clean -modcache` to clear the module cache and then run `go build` again.

4. Check if the dependency is available in the vendor directory. If you have a vendor directory, you can try running `go mod vendor` to populate it with the dependencies.

5. Check if the dependency is available in the $GOPATH/pkg/mod directory. If not, you can try running `go get` to download the dependency.

6. Check if the dependency is available in the $GOPATH/src directory. If not, you can try cloning the dependency manually into the $GOPATH/src directory.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you debug the issue and get your program to build successfully.
