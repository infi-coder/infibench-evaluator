This error message is caused by a known issue in rust-analyzer where it sometimes fails to resolve macros correctly. In this case, it is likely caused by the `console` crate using the `format_args!` macro internally, which rust-analyzer is failing to resolve.

Fortunately, this error should not affect the functionality of your code, and it should still compile and run correctly. If you want to get rid of the error message in rust-analyzer, you can try updating your rust-analyzer version or disabling the macro error diagnostics in your editor settings.

To disable macro error diagnostics in VS Code, you can add the following line to your settings.json file:
```
"rust-analyzer.diagnostics.disabled": ["macro-error"]
```
