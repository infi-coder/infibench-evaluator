It is necessary to create a list of random letters of the alphabet. And then sort it alphabetically. To create such a list, I use the following code:

```r
# Creating a random vector of letters
random_text_data = sample(letters, 10)
random_text_data

# Convert to list
list_text_data = as.list(random_text_data)
list_text_data
```

In the console I get the following:

```r
> random_text_data
[1] ""h"" ""m"" ""q"" ""b"" ""z"" ""i"" ""y"" ""f"" ""d"" ""e""
> # Convert to list
> list_text_data = as.list(random_text_data)

[1] ""i""

[[7]]
[1] ""y""

[[8]]
[1] ""f""

[[9]]
[1] ""d""

[[10]]
[1] ""e""

Now I need to sort it alphabetically. I have tried the following:

```r

sort_data = sort(list_text_data)
```

But get error:

```

I see that hibernate validator is working because if I don't use any @NotEmpty nor @NotBlank annotation, other annotations such as @Size are working correctly.

In my bean I'm importing javax.validation.constraints. When starting up my JBoss, following line about hibernate validator appears:

```
14:04:17,676 INFO  [org.hibernate.validator.internal.util.Version] (background-preinit) HV000001: Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2
```

This is not the same version as the hibernate-validator 6.0.11 jar that is resolved by Maven.

What's happening? Maybe some dependency conflict?","You are a professional assistant for programmers. By default, questions and answers are in Markdown format.

I see that hibernate validator is working because if I don't use any @NotEmpty nor @NotBlank annotation, other annotations such as @Size are working correctly.

In my bean I'm importing javax.validation.constraints. When starting up my JBoss, following line about hibernate validator appears:

```
14:04:17,676 INFO  [org.hibernate.validator.internal.util.Version] (background-preinit) HV000001: Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2
```

This is not the same version as the hibernate-validator 6.0.11 jar that is resolved by Maven.

What's happening? Maybe some dependency conflict?",

Spring Boot 2.5.0 generates plain.jar file. Can I remove it?

After the Spring Boot 2.5.0 update, it generates the `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` file alongside the usual `myprogram-0.0.1.jar`. Can I disallow gradle to generate the `*.plain.jar` file? I use Gradle 7.0.2.

I have a spreadsheet that many people need to access (on sharepoint), for a few reasons, we need to do this locally (synced).
however, there are constantly problems and errors arising due to knowledge levels of each user, the spreadsheet needs to have structure and consistency,  so in order to achieve that, i have created a userform with a suite of parameters to help people enter accurate data and avoid errors.
it is a tender register, used to enter client, client contact and tender information, which generates a quote number, folder and file name etc.
prior to OneDrive/Sharepoint path change (previously the file path would be local, now it is a sharepoint URL)
i had a macro that would run when a user clicked a button, that would create an appropriately named folder in the relevant local sharepoint directory, create a standard set of folders within that folder (Client Documents, Contract, Product Files, Drawings etc.) then open a Tender Form and save it in the created folder. the filename (the quote number) was used to lookup a query from the Tender register to return all the client/contact/quote information.
since sharepoint has changed it's path protocol from local to URL, i can't get this to work, resulting in a manual process, therefore, resulting in errors and inconsitencies.
i have searched high and low for ways to create folders and files on sharepoint using VBA, and also for ways to interact with the local path other than disabling ""Use Office applications to sync Office files that I Open"" (this function is required due to file collaboration.)
I had one hope when i found a way to convert a URL to a Local path, however, this isn't the best solution as each user syncs folders at different levels (maybe there is a way someone could help me with determining the path, a macro to search in the OneDrive directory for folder ""2021 Tenders"" and return the path... think this might be slow though)
however, i noticed if i goto File > Info, there is a button for ""Open File Location"" which takes me directly to the local path folder of the file, which tells me this information is somewhere in excel, there must be a way to retrieve it, i haven't seen reference to this in any of my searches, upon pointing it out, does anyone have any ideas on how or if this could work?
i tried to record a macro, but it didn't register it at all.
any help would be appreciated and thank you in advance.

I am attempting to utilize the AWS CLI along with a `for` loop in bash to iteratively purge multiple SQS message queues.  The bash script works almost as intended, the problem I am having is with the return value each time the AWS CLI sends a request.  When the request is successful, it returns an empty value and opens up an interactive pager in the command line.  I then have to manually type `q` to exit the interactive screen and allow the `for` loop to continue to the next iteration.  This becomes very tedious and time consuming when attempting to purge a large number of queues.
Is there a way to configure AWS CLI to disable this interactive pager from popping up for every return value?  Or a way to pipe the return values into a separate file instead of being displayed?
I have played around with configuring different return value types (text, yaml, JSON) but haven't had any luck.  Also the `--no-pagination` parameter doesn't change the behavior.

```
